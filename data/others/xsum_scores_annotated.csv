anthropic_stanford-online-all-v4-s3,"A Chinese woman who had plastic surgery to change the shape of her face has sued the hospital for damages, claiming it left her in pain.","Though the unverified story was short on details, and did not have the husband's side of the story, ""divorced because of fat face"" quickly became a top trend on microblogging network Weibo. State media picked up the story on Thursday, which was first reported in a local evening paper earlier this week. Liaoshen Wanbao reported the 49-year-old woman in Shenyang city had claimed her husband had divorced her 10 years ago because he disliked the shape of her face, said to be ""large and square"" with ""fat cheeks"". She said it spurred her to undergo facial surgery three times at a local hospital to shave her jawbones and reshape her face into a slimmer shape. During the third surgery the doctors discovered that if they proceeded further her nerves may be damaged, and halted the procedure. The woman, identified only by her surname Wang, later sued the hospital for 1.7 million yuan ($260,900; Â£183,900) in damages. She alleged the surgery had left her with soreness in her chin, and she could only eat and drink through a straw as ""when she exerted force on her lower jaw, she had the sensation that it would break"". The hospital, however, argued that the surgeries were conducted according to regulations, and pointed out that they encouraged her to seek psychiatric help instead of a third operation, which she refused. After mediation the woman agreed to accept 20,000 yuan ($3,100, Â£2,200) as compensation, said the report. On Weibo, some condemned the woman's husband, but others also chastised the woman. One top-voted comment read: ""It's purely an excuse, if her face was large then why did he decide to marry her in the first place? If he stopped loving her then he should have just said so."" It continued: ""This woman is also very silly to have believed that her face shape was the real reason for the divorce, she is lying to herself."" Said another Weibo user: ""Even if you had gone for facial surgery and made your face smaller, he would still have found other reasons to divorce you."" One person noted the sharp difference in the compensation amount and voiced suspicions: ""1.7 million was dropped to 20,000, it makes me wonder if she really did have a problem with her jaw."" Still others took the opportunity to crack jokes. ""What an odd reason for divorce! I wonder how square was this woman's square-shaped face? Like a television set? Microwave oven?"" Plastic surgery has long been a hot topic on Weibo. In December, users similarly expressed outrage when a Chinese man took out a newspaper advertisement pleading for his wife to go for plastic surgery. More than seven million cosmetic surgeries were performed in China in 2014. The industry's value, pegged at around 400bn yuan, is expected to double by 2019, according to the China Association of Plastics and Aesthetics.",1,5,4

One of the three people taken to hospital sustained serious but non life-threatening injuries, police said. The southbound carriageway has been reopened but investigations are continuing. The remaining passengers, who did not require hospital treatment, were taken to Abingdon police station. Passenger Rebecca Crow posted a picture of her injuries on Twitter and wrote: ""I was on the bus, it was insane. Very thankful for no fatalities; just a bust up face!"" The bus was a replacement for the 00:05 First Great Western service from Oxford to Didcot. Bus passenger Adam Graves said on Twitter: ""One moment the bus power failed, a minute or 2 later the lorry hit us. Bus ended up part down the embankment. #a34"" He later told BBC News: ""It sort of jumped forward. There were people screaming inside. ""Then you suddenly noticed you're falling out of your seat - everyone was flying everywhere. ""Once that initial shock had passed people were quite calm. ""A lot of people on the bus had been coming back from a gig in Oxford, that's where I'd been, that kept people calm as a few recognised each other."" In a statement, a First Great Western spokesman said the firm was ""keen"" to offer support to all of the bus passengers and their families. He said initial reports from its own contractor ""suggest the driver followed correct safety procedures"", but added police were investigating. ""We are offering them any assistance we can to understand the full details of the incident,"" he said. The A34 was shut between the Botley and Milton interchanges. It had been due to reopen at 11:00 but was delayed due to difficulties in recovering the vehicles, police said. Officers on site were having problems earlier with drivers ignoring the closure and driving through, according to BBC Radio Oxford travel reporter Sara Dumbell. She said diversions had also led to lengthy traffic delays in the area.",0,5,4
anthropic_stanford-online-all-v4-s3,A Green Party councillor has been served with a legal notice for her involvement in protests against Sheffield City Council's tree felling programme.,"Nether Edge Green Party councillor, Alison Teal, was served with a legal notice for her involvement in protests against Sheffield City Council's tree felling programme. Ms Teal was previously arrested for protesting against the tree removals. Charges against her and 13 others were dropped earlier this year. More stories from across Yorkshire Sheffield City Council maintain that the removal of street trees in the city is lawful and necessary. A ""pre-action protocol letter"" from the council's legal department to Ms Teal warned the authority will seek a High Court injunction to stop her, and others involved in ""direct action"", from taking part in future protests. The council said the process would give protesters ""a chance to further and finally consider their position"" before it begins legal proceedings on 12 July. Councillor Bryan Lodge, cabinet member for Environment and Street Scene, said there had been months of ""unlawful and costly disruption"" to tree replacement works in Sheffield by a small number of protesters. ""We continue to support the right to peacefully protest, and the majority of protesters who are doing so peacefully will not be affected,"" he added. ""But there is a big difference between this and direct action which deliberately and unlawfully stops works from being carried out."" Mr Lodge said protesters had been sent a letter several weeks ago confirming their actions were unlawful. ""Streets Ahead is not just about street trees, it's about ensuring we have roads, pavements and a street scene to be proud of for many years to come,"" he added. ""In addition, it presents us with a unique opportunity to sustainably manage, increase and maintain our diverse street tree stock over a 25 year period."" The council said, despite the letter, works were still being disrupted ""causing city-wide delays"".",1,5,4
anthropic_stanford-online-all-v4-s3,"A UKIP AM has been accused of being ""abrasive"" by party activists, while a controversial anti-Islam campaigner has been cleared to run for the party leadership.","A letter sent by party activists in north Wales claimed Michelle Brown has been ""abrasive and discourteous"" to them. It was sent to UKIP's national executive committee (NEC) before a row over racial slurs about a Labour MP, for which Ms Brown apologised. But UKIP chairman Paul Oakden said the letter did not follow proper process. A UKIP assembly group spokesman said the letter was written by a group with a ""long-standing grudge"" against the AM. The ruling NEC body discussed the issue at a meeting on Friday, where they also decided to allow a controversial anti-Islam campaigner to run for the UKIP leadership. Mr Oakden said: ""A member of the NEC had contacted the person that is putting this forward and said to them they need to follow the proper process of completing the necessary forms and submitting them to the NEC. ""Members simply emailing the NEC saying we want you to do this is not the correct disciplinary process for the party, by any stretch of the imagination. ""A member of the NEC has gone back and given advice on what they need to do."" Shaun Owen, secretary of UKIP's Delyn branch, wrote to the NEC saying: ""For some time we have been appalled by the abrasive and discourteous manner of Ms Brown towards UKIP locally. ""Her lack of effort in pursuing the aims of the party both locally and nationally is of concern to members across the region."" Mr Owen added he believed members would stop supporting UKIP if Ms Brown remained in the role. However, a spokesman for the party's assembly group dismissed the letter as written by a ""tiny and insignificant group"". In February, Ms Brown denied an allegation she had smoked recreational drugs in a hotel room. Later that month, she said she had acted ""with propriety"" after it was revealed she had discussed how an advert for a job in her assembly office could be changed to help her brother get an interview for the post. Meanwhile, UKIP's NEC confirmed that 11 hopefuls in the contest to succeed Paul Nuttall as leader will be able to run as candidates. The list includes Anne Marie Waters, the founder of the Sharia Watch pressure group, who has described Islam as evil. UKIP AM David Rowlands had said Ms Waters is probably ""too extreme"" to be allowed to stand but she claimed the party was trying to ""ostracise"" her. Other candidates who have also cleared the NEC's vetting process and are going forward to a vote of the membership include Welsh activist John Rees-Evans, London Assembly member Peter Whittle and Scottish MEP David Coburn. Mr Nuttall resigned after the general election in June when the party failed to win any seats and saw its vote plummet.",1,5,5

""So far we have cheese, a green pepper, fish, a pineapple, an aubergine, and a felt basket to put them all in.""

Earlier this year, he stole a catalogue from a house down the street owned by a policeman, which Ms Drouet said ""wasn't ideal"". Among the items stolen in the last couple of years are muslin cloths, fluffy pens, a USB phone charger cable and a child's piece of art. Theo also took to stealing Christmas decorations from neighbours' trees. Ms Drouet said this year she managed to reunite items from Theo's haul with their rightful owners before too long. ""I wrote the flyers and then luckily managed to find out who all the things belonged to,"" Ms Drouet said. ""You get tired of knocking on neighbours' doors and saying 'me again'"".",1,5,4
anthropic_stanford-online-all-v4-s3,"A colony of bats has been roosting in a church for 10 years, despite the church's best efforts to get them to move.","A colony has been roosting in St Hilda's Church at Ellerburn, close to the North York Moors. But despite the church's best efforts the bats are not moving and are soiling the altar and church furniture, leaving the church with an ""appalling smell"". The creatures are protected by law and cannot be wilfully disturbed. Volunteers at the church have been working for the past decade to keep the altar, stonework and woodwork clean. But the bats, roosting in the higher areas of the church continually soil the interior of the building with urine and faeces. Church warden Liz Cowley said keeping the 11th Century building in good shape was difficult. She said: ""You can see the urine marks (on the altar), they won't go away. ""If people were coming in here damaging an ancient building like this, you would say it was criminal damage. ""The smell is appalling, it's a combination of ammonia from the urine and a musty smell from the droppings that catches at the back of the throat."" Members of the church had spent Â£10,000 trying to get the bats to move and had paid for specially-built lofts nearby. The Rev Paul Mothersdale, the Rector of St Hilda's Church, said a lot of money had been invested in trying to persuade the bats to move out of the church. The Rev Mothersdale said: ""We've tried to do everything that English Nature, or Natural England, have wanted us to do. ""Money has been spent, not only by the congregation, not only out of church funds, but local people have mucked in and helped. ""And yet we're no further forward, we're still as we were 10 years ago."" Lucy Bellini, of Natural England, said the bats had to be carefully monitored. Ms Bellini said: ""It is a really regionally important roost. ""Because of that we need to be sure that there are replacement roosts that are suitable and that the bats have found and are aware of and can move to before we allow the church to seal up access points and move the bats out of the church.""",1,5,5
anthropic_stanford-online-all-v4-s3,"A council has been accused of ""double standards"" after it moved staff into a derelict site while residents were moved out.","In 2008, elderly residents were moved out of Greyhound Opening in Norwich and senior city council officers moved in. The council's head of neighbourhood and strategic housing, Kristine Reeves, was later sacked over the affair. The development proposals, put forward by Norwich City Council, include 60 flats and 45 houses. The report to the council says 35 of the houses and flats will be for social rent. A report to Norwich City Council's planning committee, which meets on Thursday, advises councillors to approve the plans. Elderly residents were moved out of Greyhound Opening and nearby Goldsmith Street seven years ago after Norwich City Council agreed to redevelop the site. The council agreed that new employees relocating to the city could move in temporarily ahead of demolition. However other staff, including Ms Reeves, also moved in, in contravention of council policy. The council resisted calls for a full independent inquiry. Its own investigation found safeguards covering conflicts of interest were in place but not followed. In February 2009, London-based architects Riches Hawley Mikhail won a competition to design a new social housing development on the site, but they were never commissioned. During that year homes on the derelict site were demolished, but the site has since remained untouched.",0,4,3

Speaking to BBC Asian Network, Mr Wilson, who has amassed nearly 1,000 buy-to-let properties in Kent, said a property he had bought from an Indian couple cost him about Â£12,000 because the curry smell became a ""massive problem"" and he was forced to rip up the carpet and take the house off the market for six months. ""If that makes me racist, that makes 99% of people who buy houses racist,"" he said. ""How many white people are going to go into a house that smells of curry and are going to buy [it]?""

He admitted culpable homicide on the basis of diminished responsibility after saying he had no recollection of the killing at Dixon Avenue, Glasgow, on 24 September last year. Buksh will be sentenced on 27 June. The High Court in Glasgow heard that 43-year-old Mrs Buksh died after being struck on the head at least five times. Pathologists told the court that the lack of defensive injuries and the position of her body suggested she was assaulted as she slept. Following the attack, Buksh went to Cathcart Police Station and told an officer: ""I've come to hand myself in. I think my wife's dead. I hit her on the head. I did it."" The court was told that three psychiatrists described Buksh as suffering from an acute stress disorder at the time. Prosecutor Gordon Lamont said: ""The accused and his wife had been married for 25 years, but over the last 10 or 11 years their relationship appears to have broken down and they became increasingly estranged, albeit, still residing under the one roof. ""They slept separately and Mrs Buksh routinely slept on the sofa in the living room. Their children report that they barely spoke to each other."" Mr Lamont said the problems in the marriage intensified after Mrs Buksh went to Pakistan on holiday in May last year. He said she had become involved with another man and was making plans to move to Pakistan. The court also heard that two days before he killed his wife, Buksh went to Paisley Police Office and spoke with a support officer saying he feared his wife was going to take their youngest child, aged 10, to Pakistan and not return. He also made an emergency doctor's appointment and said he was suffering from stress and not sleeping. He was prescribed medication for stress. Defence counsel Sarah Livingstone said: ""My client has no memory of this incident. His amnesia is absolutely genuine. ""This is not a case where this man was a bad husband, there was no domestic abuse. This was an unhappy marriage, but however, unhappy it was it didn't justify killing his wife.

anthropic_stanford-online-all-v4-s3,A woman was beaten to death in a McDonald's restaurant in China after she refused to give her phone number to cult members.,"The woman, 37-year-old Wu Shuoyan, is alleged to have been killed last May simply for refusing to hand over her phone number to cult members. The murder, filmed on CCTV and on mobile phones, sparked outrage. The Church of the Almighty God cult is banned in China but claims to have millions of members. Following the brutal killing in May, Chinese authorities said that they detained hundreds of members of the cult, reports the BBC's Martin Patience in Beijing. Interviewed in prison later, one of the defendants, Zhang Lidong showed no remorse. He said: ""I beat her with all my might and stamped on her too. She was a demon. We had to destroy her."" The group had entered a small McDonalds branch in Zhaoyuan in Shandong province last May soliciting phone numbers and hoping to recruit members to their cult. Ms Wu was waiting in the restaurant with her seven-year-old son and when she refused to give her number, an act which prompted the beating while they screamed at other diners to keep away or they would face the same fate. The public face of the Church of the Almighty God is a website full of uplifting hymns and homilies. But its core belief is that God has returned to earth as a Chinese woman to wreak the apocalypse. The only person who claims direct contact with this god is a former physics teacher, Zhao Weishan, who founded the cult 25 years ago and has since fled to the United States, says BBC China Editor Carrie Gracie. No-one knows exactly where he is, but much of the website's message of outright hostility to the Chinese government is delivered in English as well as Chinese. The cult complains that religious faith has suffered from persecution by the Communist Party. Since the McDonald's murder, public outrage has forced the authorities to increase pressure on the Church of the Almighty God with almost daily arrests and raids.",1,5,5

Last month, the Supreme Court ruled that the anthem must be played in every cinema before a film is screened. Some 20 people have been held in Kerala and Tamil Nadu since then for remaining seated during the anthem. Also, India's colonial-era sedition law has been often used against students, journalists, writers and social activists and those critical of the government. Reports said that the BJP's youth wing lodged a complaint against a Facebook post by Mr Chavara which allegedly insulted the anthem. The post was apparently an excerpt from one of his books. Senior police official Sateesh Bino told the NDTV news channel that the writer-activist ""is being questioned for his controversial post on the national anthem on Facebook"" and had been charged with sedition. Earlier this month, 12 people were arrested at a cinema in Kerala, after they remained seated while the national anthem played. The cinemagoers, who were attending an international film festival, were later freed but they face charges of ""failure to obey an order issued by a public servant, thereby causing obstruction or annoyance to others"". And at a cinema in Chennai, eight people who did not stand for the anthem were assaulted and abused, police said. The eight were later charged with showing disrespect to the anthem.",1,5,5

Brazil's Joao Gomes Junior took silver and South African Cameron van der Burgh was third. ""I'm feeling very good. I'm so, so happy with my displays,"" Peaty said. He was speaking to the BBC after taking part in the 4x100m mixed medley relay final, in which defending champions Britain finished fifth. USA won in a world record time of three minutes 38.56 seconds. Australia took silver, with China and Canada in joint third. It was a different story in his individual race, earlier. Peaty was level with his rivals in the first few strokes before he pulled away after 30 metres. The City of Derby swimmer appeared set to break the world record for a third time in two days, but narrowly fell short. The Briton suggested ""equilibrium"" was key to his successes.

It's not even breaststroke anymore, he's swimming like a new kind of stroke, like a metamorphosis between [butter]fly and breast. Former British swimmer Mark Foster told BBC Sport that Peaty's display was ""immense"". ""There not enough words to describe how good he is,"" he said. ""Under 26 seconds for the second time - only four hundredths of a second off his best time. It was, again, an immense swim."" Karen Pickering, British 2001 world 4x200m freestyle gold medallist We all know how strong Peaty is. In his semi-final he was a little bit lower in the water as he set his world record. Because he's not quite as high as he is in the 100m, he has a quicker turnover. He can keep that up for 50m, but not for a 100m - that's why he went to 25.95 seconds. You couldn't do that in the 100m because of the build-up of lactic acid. But because it's Adam Peaty, he might be able to manage that in a year.

anthropic_stanford-online-all-v4-s3,Almost half of the children in foster care in Scotland have been moved to three or more foster families since going into care.,"Research carried out by the Fostering Network suggests almost half of fostered young people are already living with their third foster family since going into care. The group has warned that 750 more foster carers are ""urgently"" needed to meet the demands of the care system. It urged people to ""open their hearts and homes"" to vulnerable youngsters. Currently, more than 5,500 children are in foster care in Scotland, living with 4,400 families and carers. The Fostering Network surveyed 250 children, teenagers and foster carers across Scotland and discovered that many young people had failed to find stability. Almost half were already living with their third family, a quarter were with their fourth family and about 20 were living with their 10th family since going into care. There was a particular need for homes to be found for vulnerable teenagers, siblings and disabled children, the study found. Carla, 23, was taken into care at the age of 12 and had eight foster homes before moving in with the Randalls. ""Looking back now I realised that the Randalls saved my life,"" she said. ""I never understood the extent of the neglect and abuse I had endured until I came to live with a 'normal' loving family. ""They were just always themselves, the smallest details meant so much to me. ""They nurtured a young, angry, untrusting teenager to become a positive, empathetic and successful young woman."" The Fostering Network said instability had a detrimental effect on the child's education and wellbeing, while finding a stable foster carer from the outset could lead to improved relationships and a happier childhood. Sara Lurie, director of the Fostering Network Scotland, said: ""As each year passes, we see more and more children coming into care. ""We need people who can open their heart, and their homes, to vulnerable children and young people and use their skills to help support them to reach their full potential. ""In particular we need people who have the skills, patience and passion to look after teenagers who may have had a really tough time and be facing some real challenges, and to offer them love, stability and security. ""A good foster carer will believe in the ambition of the children in their care in the same way they'd believe in the ambition of their biological family members."" Apologies for the delay, see below as requested. A Scottish government spokeswoman said: ""Giving young people security is paramount and we have done a great deal of work with our partners across local government and the third sector to improve how we intervene early when there is a problem within families to find appropriate solutions quickly. ""We have also expanded the age at which young people can remain in foster care as part of the continuing care provisions and the support available when they transition into independent living.""",1,5,4

""In a lifetime of pretty much impossible things that have happened to our band, this is the highlight,"" said frontman Win Butler. Earlier, every stage at the event was closed after lightning struck ground. Dance act Rudimental were escorted off the main stage mid-set, and had to abandon their planned encore - Feel The Love, with guest vocalist John Newman. ""We're quite upset,"" musician Amir Amor told the BBC, ""but we had a great time anyway"". Metallica's Lars Ulrich was flying into the site by helicopter as the storm descended. ""It was kind of frightening,"" he said. ""When we landed, all the people picking us up were going, 'we didn't expect you were going to fly in this weather'. ""But the pilot didn't say anything about that. We saw the lightning up there. I thought it was pyrotechnics for Arcade Fire."" The thunderstorm heralded a brief but torrential downpour, and the power cut took BBC coverage off the air. Music resumed on the main stage at 19:00 BST with Lily Allen, who dedicated an expletive-laden song to FIFA president Sepp Blatter. Other performers on Friday included Blondie, who proved so popular it became impossible to enter or leave The Other Stage at lunchtime, and Paolo Nutini, whose soulful ballads were a fitting soundtrack as dusk fell over Somerset. Sophie Ellis-Bextor sneaked some disco into her set at the largely-acoustic Avalon Stage, while the pulsing synthpop of Glaswegian band Chvrches made for a steamy atmosphere in the John Peel tent as fans danced off the downpour. Arcade Fire took to the stage shortly after 22:00 BST, their arrival heralded by a man dressed from head-to-toe in a mirrored suit. Bravely, considering the weather conditions, the 12-piece band were largely dressed in white, but if they were worried about laundry bills, it didn't show. They threw themselves around the stage, thrashing and spinning as though plagued by a swarm of invisible bees, each member switching instruments between - and often during - songs. As well as guitars, they played steel drums, xylophones and even a hurdy gurdy. Frontman Win Butler made frequent excursions into the audience and, during the song Flashbulb Eyes, plucked a camera from a press photographer and carried it on stage to capture the band's performance. The set list was evenly spread across their four albums, with highlights including No Cars Go, Neighborhood #1 (Tunnels) and Rebellion (Lies). The group's recurring subject matter of suburban despair and alienation might have seemed like an odd fit for Glastonbury's peace and love ethos, but there is an optimism and belief in humanity at the core of their music. Plus, they have really catchy choruses.

anthropic_stanford-online-all-v4-s3,"Archaeologists have discovered a Mesolithic Period ""snug"" at a site near Stonehenge, which they believe was used for 90 years.","The shelter - in a hollow left behind by a fallen tree - at Blick Mead was used over a 90-year period from 4336 BC, it is believed. Archaeologist David Jacques, said: ""They... used the stump of the tree, about three metres high, as a wall."" The finds are being shown to United Nations heritage experts, who are currently visiting Stonehenge. Archaeologists are concerned a planned 2.9km tunnel being considered for the nearby A303 main road will damage the site. Discoveries have also shown stones were warmed up by the Mesolithic Period inhabitants and used in a hearth to emit heat in the earthy snug. Mr Jacques, a senior research fellow at the University of Buckingham, has worked at Blick Mead for over a decade, making a number of discoveries about the inhabitants. The tree stump created a wall height similar to a ""modern bungalow"". ""They've draped probably animal skins or thatch around the basin and connected it to a post so it's a very comfortable snug little place,"" he said. The wooden wall of the hollow was lined with flints and the large earthy pit created by the tree root lined with cobbles and decorated with ""exotic"" stones from outside the area. ""There are some clever and sophisticated things going on, the hot stones that they put into this little type of alcove wouldn't have been on fire,"" explained Mr Jacques. ""It looks more like these people have been using these hot stones as a type of storage heater so that you've got a lot of warmth coming off them."" Mr Jacques will meet the UN experts later to ask for the route to be moved closer to Salisbury and for hydrological assessments to be made. ""It's very likely the water flow would be reduced in and around the site,"" he said. ""It would take out all the organics and destroy all the animal bone we've been finding which is crucial for finding where they have been living and for getting radiocarbon dates from all the organics like pollen and wood. ""This is massively important for reconstructing what the landscape would have looked like."" Andy Rhind-Tutt, former mayor and chairman of Amesbury Museum and Heritage Trust said: ""I sincerely hope the team delivering the long-awaited A303 improvement look seriously at an alternative alignment south of Salisbury and away from this unequalled archaeological landscape. ""It would be criminal to destroy such a rich heritage and connection with our ancestors for the sake of blocking the view to the passing public of Stonehenge.""",1,4,4

But he also raised concerns about possible damage to the site over plans to build a road tunnel past Stonehenge. The Department of Transport said it would ""consult before any building"". The Blick Mead site is about 1.5 miles (2.4km) from Stonehenge and archaeologists said ""scientifically tested charcoal"" dug up from the site had ""revealed that it dated from around 4000 BC"". David Jacques said the dig had also found ""evidence of feasting"" including burnt flints, tools and remains of giant cattle, known as aurochs, which were eaten by early hunter gatherers. Mr Jacques said: ""British pre-history may have to be rewritten. This is the latest dated Mesolithic encampment ever found in the UK. ""Blick Mead site connects the early hunter gatherer groups returning to Britain after the Ice Age to the Stonehenge area, all the way through to the Neolithic in the late 5th Millennium BC. ""But our only chance to find out about the earliest chapter of Britain's history could be wrecked if the tunnel goes ahead."" Andy Rhind-Tutt, a former mayor and current chairman of Amesbury Museum, which part-funded the dig, said the discovery could ""provide what archaeologists have been searching for centuries - the answer to the story of the pre-history of Stonehenge."" Earlier this month, the government announced funding for a 1.8-mile (2.9km) tunnel to remove congestion from the main road past Stonehenge. A Department for Transport spokesman said: ""As with any road scheme, we will consult with interested parties before any building begins on the A303.

anthropic_stanford-online-all-v4-s3,"BHS could be saved from liquidation by a bid led by retail veteran Greg Tufnell, who has a track record of turning around struggling firms.","BHS entered administration in April. Since then, efforts have been continuing to rescue it from closure and save the jobs of its 11,000 staff. Last week, a surprise late bid led by retail veteran Greg Tufnell transformed the race to acquire the retailer. His team, said to be backed by Portuguese money, is the front-runner. But if a deal cannot be struck, the business may still have to be liquidated. The remaining bidders have faded into the background. Another consortium led by Matalan tycoon John Hargreaves and Turkish retail entrepreneur Cafer Mahiroglu has reportedly run into difficulties, while other suitors have apparently failed to impress with their proposals. Some of those involved in the different bids have impressive retailing histories. But then Sir Philip Green, who controlled BHS from 2000 to 2015, also had a brilliant track record. And he ended up selling the business for Â£1. So what are the chances of saving BHS from the liquidators? And just who are the people aiming to do it? In the public eye, Greg Tufnell is easily overshadowed by his more famous brother Phil, the former England cricketer. But that could change if his bid for BHS is successful, because he hopes to become the firm's next chairman. And as far as his credentials for the job are concerned, the 54-year-old executive certainly talks the talk. He describes himself as ""a highly experienced managing director with Mothercare and Arcadia, a blend of entrepreneur, strategist and hands-on operator with significant commercial business turnaround, acquisition and fund-raising experience"". His record shows that he was buying and merchandising director at Next from 1991 to 1994. He then spent three years as managing director of menswear retailer Burton, part of the Arcadia group, followed by another three years as managing director of Mothercare. He currently appears to occupy a portfolio of different jobs, including the chairmanships of leather accessories brand Zatchels and recruitment consultancy hga Group. Earlier this month, he registered a new firm, Richess Group, at Companies House. Its other directors are Nick de Scossa, a Swiss banker, and Lisbon-based entrepreneur Jose Maria Soares Bento. Until Mr Tufnell's bid turned up, many observers had assumed that BHS would be snapped up by Matalan founder Mr Hargreaves. But it appears that the cost of a deal may have proved too high. Sources say Mr Hargreaves was asked to improve his offer and balked. Like Sir Philip Green, 71-year-old John Hargreaves also enjoys the life of the super-rich. He has an estimated fortune of Â£1bn, according to the Sunday Times Rich List. But in stark contrast to the ebullient Sir Philip, Mr Hargreaves is described by industry insiders as quiet-spoken, someone who shuns the limelight. Mr Hargreaves is no longer directly involved in the business he founded. He sold his 69% stake in Matalan in 2000, then in 2006 took it private through Missouri Bidco, a company 53.5% owned by him and his family.

Speaking at a news conference on Wednesday, Mayor Rawlings-Blake said Mr Batts had ""served this city with distinction"" since becoming police chief in October 2012. But referring to the city's high homicide rate, she said ""too many continue to die"". ""The focus has been too much on the leadership of the department and not enough on the crime fighting,"" she told reporters, adding: ""We need to get the crime surge under control."" The city has seen a sharp increase in violence since Freddie Gray's death on 19 April, with 155 homicides this year, a 48% increase over the same period last year. On Tuesday, the police department announced that an outside organisation will review its response to the civil unrest that followed Mr Gray's death. The US justice department is also conducting a civil rights review of the Baltimore force and Mr Batts has been criticised by the city's police union. Earlier on Wednesday, the union released its report into the police handling of the rioting. It said officers had complained ""that they lacked basic riot equipment, training, and, as events unfolded, direction from leadership"". The report also said ""officers repeatedly expressed concern that the passive response to the civil unrest had allowed the disorder to grow into full scale rioting"". Recent events had ""placed attention on police leadership"", Ms Rawlings-Blake said, but denied her decision was influenced by the union report. Mr Davis, who is taking over immediately as interim police chief, praised his ""friend"" Mr Batts and said he was a ""true reform commissioner"".

His intervention in the debate - made, as he termed it, with ""deafening eclat"" - was even said to have helped cause the pound to slide on the international money markets as traders thought it made the possibility of a so-called Brexit more likely. He has arguably the highest profile of any of the governing Conservative Party except the Prime Minister David Cameron, but those outside the UK may be wondering: who is he, and is that actually his hair? Read on. Profile: Boris Johnson How could 'zip wire prat' become prime minister? Read more about the UK's referendum on the EU Alexander Boris de Pfeffel Johnson, to give him his full name, was born in New York and is descended from Turkish, French and German stock. He describes himself as a ""one-man melting pot"". He first made a name for himself in journalism, including a stint as Brussels correspondent for the right-wing Daily Telegraph newspaper and editor of The Spectator magazine. His humorous persona led him to become a fixture on various television programmes, including the satirical BBC panel show Have I Got News For You. He still has a lucrative and entertaining column in the Daily Telegraph, in which august forum he explained the reasons for his decision on the EU. As a politician, he has been a Conservative member of parliament for two constituencies, Henley from 2001 to 2008 and then Uxbridge and South Ruislip from 2015. Lest you think he was putting his feet up between parliamentary mandates, he is also currently serving the second of two terms as mayor of London, no mean feat in a city where the centre-left Labour Party has dominated in recent decades. That's indicative of the position Mr Johnson has carved out for himself as one of the most charismatic politicians in the UK who has wide appeal beyond Conservative heartlands - polling has suggested that his stance on the EU referendum may sway some undecided voters. Just look what happens when you type his name into Google.co.uk. Not quite. He has previously courted controversy for his remarks about (among others) the populations of Liverpool, Portsmouth and Papua New Guinea, not to mention run-ins with his own party leadership and TV chef Jamie Oliver. Last October he accidentally flattened a 10-year-old schoolboy at what was meant to be a friendly game of photo-op rugby in Japan. But none of this seems to have affected his standing among the party faithful or the public at large. Even getting stuck on a zip-wire during the London Olympics in 2012, a sure-fire route to derision for any other politician, only enhanced his eccentric image.

It also says they should not ratify a similar deal that has already been done between the EU and Canada. It says some aspects pose a threat to democracy and the rule of law. One of the concerns mentioned in the petition is the idea of tribunals that foreign investors would be able to use in some circumstances to sue governments. There is a great deal of controversy over exactly what this system, known as Investor State Dispute Settlement, would enable companies to do, but campaigners see it as an opportunity for international business to get compensation for government policy changes that adversely affect them. This kind of provision exists in many bilateral trade and investment agreements. Friends of the Earth have published new research on the impact they have had on EU countries. Information about these cases is not always made public, but the group says that going back to 1994, foreign investors have sought compensation of almost €30bn (£24bn) from 20 states. Where the results are known (a small minority of the total), the tribunals have awarded total compensation of €3.5bn (about £2.8bn). In Britain, the possible implications of this provision for the National Health Service have been especially controversial. Campaigners believe that the investor tribunals would make it harder to reverse any decisions to contract services out to international healthcare firms. John Hilary of War on Want said: TTIP ""will make it impossible for any future government to repeal the Health & Social Care Act and bring the NHS back into public hands"". The petition lists a number of other areas where its signatories believes European standards would suffer if the TTIP negotiations are completed and the Canada deal is ratified: employment, social, environmental, privacy and consumer protection. The European Commission says the EU will not have to sacrifice its high standards. It also says investor protection provisions are important for investment flows and have in general worked well. But it accepts there is a need for improvement and is trying to achieve that in its bilateral negotiations. The petition has been organised as an exercise called a European Citizens' Initiative which can lead to a public hearing in the European Parliament and require the European Commission to give a formal response explaining why it is accepting or rejecting what the petitioners call for. The European Commission has already said that the petition doesn't qualify as such an Initiative. Campaigners have launched a legal challenge to this decision.",1,5,5

It said some councils had made savings in the past by freezing fees paid to providers, but care providers were now also facing financial problems. Some companies - particularly those in southern England - are struggling to attract staff, amid increasing concern about the quality of care, it said. ""What is at stake is the continuing capacity of adult social care to sustain services to those in greatest need,"" ADASS president Ray James said. ""In virtually all our authorities, the number in need is growing, while the complexity of their needs is increasing."" ADASS called for the government to ""protect essential care and support services to the most vulnerable members of our community"". But a government spokesman said the survey ""ignores"" a commitment to invest £10bn in health services that are being ""joined up"" with social care, by 2020. The BBC has launched an online guide to the care system for the over-65s. The ""care calculator"" covers residential care and the support provided in people's own homes, for tasks such as washing and dressing. Users can submit their postcode and find out how much each service costs where they live in the UK. There is also a dedicated BBC Cost of Care website, with news stories, analysis and video. The spokesman said: ""Increasing budgets isn't the only solution. By working innovatively and joining up health and social care we can improve care and also save money."" However, Councillor Izzi Seccombe, from the Local Government Association (LGA), said adult social care services were facing ""enormous pressures"" due to ""insufficient funding, growing demand and escalating costs"". ""We have long warned that investing in the NHS whilst social care budgets are under continual pressure is simply a false economy. ""It is social care services that support elderly and vulnerable people to maintain their independence, live in their own community and stay out of hospital longer,"" she added. Caroline Abrahams, charity director at Age UK, said the idea of a further £1bn coming out of social care budgets was ""chilling"".

anthropic_stanford-online-all-v4-s3,"Cuts to central government funding are threatening the services local authorities provide, with Leicestershire facing a £19m black hole in its budget.","Byron Rhodes is taking me around the modern council headquarters. It's full of light. It's busy. The building has regenerated the area around Melton Mowbray's railway station, once a muddy pot-holed piece of wasteland where those in the know parked for free. Now the council offices link the station to a park and the town centre. It was partly paid for with insurance money after a fire destroyed the old offices on the other side of town. A supermarket moved in to replace it and helped with the money too, putting the council on a firm financial footing. But that was four years ago and the crisis is a different one today. It's being experienced by all local authorities - cuts in central government funding which threaten the services they provide. Mr Rhodes is also deputy leader of Leicestershire County Council, with responsibility for finance. Leicestershire is historically the poorest funded council in the country because of a quirk of Whitehall recalculations, going back a quarter of a century since the poll tax, or community charge, was scrapped. At the moment councils get income from council tax, a share of the business rates, any income they generate themselves from services plus a grant from central government. It's the grant cut which is causing them grief. What's called the ""core funding"" is worked out by the number of homes multiplied by a set amount. And each authority has a different value set per dwelling. If we look at Surrey, which is top of the table, the amount will be £1,686 by 2019/20. Nottinghamshire is mid-table at £1,482, Derbyshire is in the lower reaches with £1,422 per dwelling and then comes Leicestershire at £1,354. ""The funding system is chaotic,"" says Byron Rhodes. ""It doesn't reflect real need. Look at Oxfordshire which is an interesting example,"" he says with a glint in his eye. Could he possibly be referring to the prime ministerial plea to the county council about cutbacks to services there? ""If we had the same funding as Oxfordshire, we'd have £50m a year extra. If we had the same as Surrey, we'd have £100m more. We'd be partying everyday if we had that kind of money."" Leicestershire have been helped with a small share of what's been called transitional funding - about £300m to help councils following pressure from Conservative MPs. Think back to the vote on Sunday trading. With a majority of only 17 in the Commons, the Conservatives lost the vote when 20 odd rebelled. Last month there would've been another rebellion, including some of our own Tory MPs in the East Midlands, if something wasn't done to improve the local government finance settlement over the next four years. The money has gone largely to shire counties. Leicestershire got £6.6m spread over two years, enough to save some services from closure. But it's a drop in the ocean for an authority with a £19m black hole in the budget every year after the latest cutbacks. Labour have protested that 83% of the councils getting transition funding are Conservative-run. Many Labour-run",1,5,5

anthropic_stanford-online-all-v4-s3,Dissident republicans were suspected of hiding weapons in a forest near Larne after two barrels were found containing explosives and guns.,"A ""terrorist hide"" was uncovered at Capanagh Forest near Larne after two members of the public found suspicious objects in the woods on Saturday. Some of the items found included an armour-piercing improvised rocket and two anti-personnel mines. The main line of police inquiry is the arms belonged to dissident republicans. Last week, Home Secretary Theresa May said MI5 believed an attack on targets in Great Britain by dissident republicans had become ""a strong possibility"". Analysis: Vincent Kearney, BBC News NI's home affairs correspondent The discovery of what appears to be a second dissident republican arms dump near Larne within three months has left police baffled. Based on location alone, the analysis would be that the items found most likely belonged to loyalist paramilitaries. But the nature of what was found suggests otherwise and the finger of suspicion firmly in the direction of dissident republicans. Det Supt Kevin Geddes said the threat level in Northern Ireland from dissident republican groups remains ""severe"" and an attack is ""highly likely"". Police officers found three barrels hidden in holes in the forest. As well as rockets and mines, there were also several pipe bombs, assault rifle ammunition and parts to construct a ""substantial number of explosive devices"". Det Supt Geddes said the seizure was significant ""both in terms of its size and its capability"". ""A number of these devices were ready to be deployed,"" he added. ""This seizure has undoubtedly saved lives."" He said the type of weapons that had been found meant police would focus their investigation on dissident republicans. In March, an arms find was made at Carnfunnock Country Park near Larne, and police said the were investigating a connection between the two discoveries. ""There are links in terms of the general location and the manner and method of storage and packaging of these munitions,"" Det Supt Geddes said.

I got it like other people on our network. The buzz around it was then created on different social media websites and with videos. I was here on 25 January when riot police forced us out and by the 28th, we were back following the violence. I've been sleeping here most of the time since. Our social network was established in 2005, when there was a democratic opening around the time of the presidential elections. People from different backgrounds all met through blogging and hoped to use technology for social change. It meant we have all gained good contacts, experience and strong networks. I like to think the social network is the people itself. Things like Facebook, Twitter, SMS and phones are just social tools. When they blocked Facebook and shut down technology, our network still operated because it's about people. Internet activists are also people and a lot of our organising, social work and relationships are developed offline. This is something that people dreamt of but didn't anticipate happening in reality. If anything, it shows that all the effort we put in over the past few years has not been wasted. It has climaxed into this critical mass of people you see in the square. At the moment I'm not getting a lot of internet connection. I'm trying not to drain my phone battery. We're still using it to distribute footage people are bringing to us that we've sorted through. I hope the internet will continue to play a complementary role in activism. At the moment we physically exist in downtown Cairo and I hope that when we have finished this sit-in, we will have won the right to organise ourselves outside the internet. Twitter: Amr Gharbeia I was involved in this revolution from the first day, 25 January, and I've now been spending my nights here for a while. For the past five years, I was very active online, blogging and tweeting. As we live under emergency laws in Egypt it has been very difficult to meet or communicate except on the internet. I'd never been part of a demonstration on the ground. At first we were mocking the event on 25 January. We questioned whether it was really possible to have a ""Facebook revolution"". I came on the 25th because I felt it was my duty as a citizen and I couldn't believe how it turned into something so different from what we've seen before. I was walking among the people and weeping. Now I sometimes just tweet to update people about what's going on or to call for a million-man demonstration or a day to remember our martyrs. I'm well-known among bloggers for my long articles and constant tweets, but once I was here I stopped communicating this way so much. I felt it was totally different to have real freedom rather than just hypothetical freedom or internet freedom. Blogging and tweeting has been important as we were building our minds.

anthropic_stanford-online-all-v4-s3,Eight Glasgow council areas have been given £1bn to invest in infrastructure projects as part of a City Deal.,"They include a new water sports park, railway station and a sliproad from the M77. The City Deal scheme will see eight council areas around Glasgow receive about £1bn from the UK and Scottish governments. The councils also have the power to borrow extra cash. The Glasgow and Clyde Valley City Deal involved massive investment by both the Scottish and UK governments last year. Eight councils - Glasgow, East Renfrewshire, Renfrewshire, Inverclyde, North and South Lanarkshire and East and West Dunbartonshire - are involved. The City Deal scheme will see Westminster and Holyrood give £500m each in additional grant funding to the eight council areas. The councils will supplement this by borrowing £130m. Councillors from across all eight areas will meet to discuss some of the schemes. Several of the projects being discussed later are in East Renfrewshire, where £44m is expected to be invested over the next few years, with much of the money coming from the City Deal funding. One is a water sports park at the Dams to Darnley Country Park. It would open in 2017 and include a centre offering wakeboarding, the fastest-growing extreme sport in the world. A new railway station in Barrhead and sliproad from the M77 would serve an area which could become one of East Renfrewshire's fastest growth areas. The council expects 1,000 new homes to be built there. Another project would transform the Levern Works site in Barrhead. A site formerly occupied by Nestle, where pet food was once made, would be cleared. The site will then be marketed for development for a range of uses that will bring new jobs to Barrhead.

Needing 99 to win, England sent out Jos Buttler and Ben Stokes in the top four. But they were eventually beaten by the fading light, finishing 25 runs short of a famous victory on 74-4. The tourists could not find the boundary frequently enough before the umpires brought the teams off, with Joe Root 33 not out. However, this was a hugely impressive performance from England and one that will fill them with confidence ahead of the second Test in Dubai, which begins on Thursday. After England concluded their innings on 598-9 in the morning, Pakistan looked assured at 113-3 shortly after tea, leading by 38 with seven second-innings wickets remaining. But the match turned when veteran batsman Younus Khan, playing in his 102nd Test match, mistimed a wild heave to give Rashid his first Test wicket - caught at point by Stokes. Rashid - whose figures in the first innings were the worst ever by a debutant - then quickly added a second victim, having Asad Shafiq caught behind for six. The door was opened for England, and Rashid and Moeen Ali barged through it as they polished off the last five wickets for 14 runs. Pakistan skipper Misbah ul-Haq - who had played with restraint for his 51 - inexplicably aimed an uncharacteristic slog at Moeen and was bowled. Moeen then removed Wahab Riaz caught behind, before Rashid claimed the final three wickets - all superbly caught at first slip by James Anderson. England sensed an unlikely victory, but their reorganised batting order could not score quickly enough as Pakistan's tactic of spin from both ends and fielders on the boundary brought them regular wickets. Makeshift opener Buttler was trapped lbw for four, Moeen and Stokes were caught on the boundary in quick succession, and Jonny Bairstow was stumped attempting a big shot. However, in truth it was mistakes earlier in the match that ultimately proved more costly as England fell just short of their first win on the subcontinent since beating India in Kolkata in 2012. In Pakistan's first innings, Ian Bell dropped Mohammad Hafeez (98) and Shafiq (107) at slip early in their innings. And Shoaib Malik, who made 245, was dismissed off a no-ball by Stuart Broad. England captain Alastair Cook, whose record-breaking 263 in the first innings was ultimately in vain, admitted England were frustrated to come so close to victory. ""We'd have liked another three or four overs at the end but that's the way it goes,"" he said. ""I can't fault the guys for hanging in there on that wicket.

Appointments affected include scans and consultations with specialists - including those for cancer patients. The British Medical Association said such incentives were ""misguided"". At least nine clinical commissioning groups (CCGs) were offering GP practices payments for hitting targets, according to Pulse's investigation. In one case, Birmingham South Central CCG was offering practices more than Â£11,000 to reduce new outpatient attendances, follow-ups, A&E attendances and emergency admissions by 1%, compared with 2014/15. It said the schemes, which exclude cancer referrals, were designed to ""incentivise best quality practice"" and ""drive improvements in the quality of primary medical care"". ""Our priority is to ensure that patients have access to services that they need, when they need them,"" said a spokesperson for Birmingham South Central CCG. Another CCG told Pulse it had considered the ""full impact"" of the incentive scheme and was ""confident that there is no conflict of interest"". Pulse said that one scheme had already been looked at by the General Medical Council, the body which regulates medical standards in the UK, after local GP leaders expressed their concern. The magazine pointed out that initial hospital referrals for cancer patients should happen within two weeks of a GP first suspecting the condition. Dr Chand Nagpaul, chairman of the GPs committee of the doctors' trade union the British Medical Association, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that such schemes were a ""financial contaminant"" to patient-doctor trust. He said: ""It's short-sighted and misguided of CCGs to introduce such mechanisms, because they do lead to the potential for patients questioning the motives of GP referrals. ""We believe it is far more appropriate for CCGs to introduce clinical pathways that ensure patients are referred appropriately rather than these crude, salesman-like bonuses which pay GPs simply to make reduction to referrals in numerical terms."" Dr Peter Melton is local GP and clinical chief officer for North East Lincolnshire CCG, which offers the equivalent of more than Â£6,000 to practices that reduce outpatient referrals to the same level as the 25% with the lowest referral rates (which include two-week urgent cancer referrals) in 2014/15. He said the CCG was already among the best in England for referring suspected cancer patients to a consultant within two weeks and the scheme was not about avoiding sending people to hospital. ""It is not focussing on referral reduction per se but on better clinical and quality standards for the patient,"" he explained. ""The expectation is practices will be encouraged to investigate more locally and monitor the patient in the first instance rather than automatically refer in to a secondary care service.""

anthropic_stanford-online-all-v4-s3,"Harper Lee's only novel, To Kill a Mockingbird, was published 50 years ago and is still widely read.","Harper Lee's classic was published 50 years ago this summer and it remains the only novel she ever wrote. Lee, 84, has never explained why she stopped writing. She doesn't give interviews - ""Hell, no"" was her response to a request several decades ago - and that silence has only added to the intrigue. But her close friend Thomas Lane Butts, a retired minister in her hometown, Monroeville, Alabama, says she once told him the reason. Sitting on a pew in the Methodist church which the Lee family still attends, he described to me how she suddenly brought the subject up one night over dinner in New York. ""She asked me, 'You ever wonder why I didn't write anything else?' And I said, 'Along with several million other people, yes, I had wondered about that.' And she said, 'Well, what do you think?'"" Speaking in his slow southern drawl, the Rev Butts, who just turned 80, suggested to her that she had already written a great book and therefore didn't need to compete with herself. ""And when I got through she said, 'You're all wrong.' I said, 'Alright, smart Alec. You tell me.' She said, 'I would not go through all the deprivation of privacy through which I went for this book again for any amount of money.' ""And she said, 'I did not need to write another book. I said what I wanted to say in that book.'"" Harper Lee called it a simple tale about the ""conflict of the human soul"" and Monroeville, Alabama, is where she drew her inspiration. The story depicts the segregated South of her childhood, during the Depression. It was published at the height of the civil rights struggle. The Rev Butts grew up 10 miles outside Monroeville. By the late 1950s, he says, he was a ""fuzzy-cheeked young preacher"" campaigning for an end to segregation. He had met Martin Luther King Jr and signed a petition to boycott buses. The Ku Klux Klan had left a burning cross on his front lawn. He says To Kill a Mockingbird was not well received in Monroeville when it was published. ""The people who were hard racist did not like it because of the implication of the book,"" the Rev Butts told me. ""The book revealed racism and that always frightens a racist - when you pull the cover off them. ""Those of us who stood up for civil rights were much encouraged by the book because in a very skilful and subtle way it addressed itself for justice."" But these days, the Rev Butts says, there is enormous civic pride in Monroeville. The old courthouse, which Hollywood re-created for the film, now houses a museum to Harper Lee and the town's other literary icon, Truman Capote. Capote was a childhood friend of hers and is thought to be the inspiration for the Dill character in To Kill a Mockingbird. The town's residents often try to protect Lee, allowing her to live a normal life instead of being hounded by fans or bothered with prying questions. ""Being famous",1,4,4

Since July last year, the Indian rupee has seen one of the biggest declines among Asian currencies, dropping more than 27% against the US dollar. ""Shocking numbers as growth was even lower than lows witnessed during the financial crisis,"" said Anubhuti Sahay from Standard Chartered Bank in Mumbai. The BBC's Yogita Limaye in Mumbai said that just a year ago India was aspiring for double-digit growth. But a global slowdown has reduced external demand, and high inflation coupled with a weak rupee has made things more expensive within the country.

Election officials have urged patience. Uhuru Kenyatta, who faces trial at the International Criminal Court, has been leading in early presidential results declared from Monday's tightly contested election. He is due to stand trial at The Hague next month for allegedly fuelling violence after the disputed 2007 election. He denies the charge. His closest rival is outgoing Prime Minister Raila Odinga. With provisional results in from more than 40% of polling stations earlier on Wednesday, Mr Odinga had 42% of the vote compared with Mr Kenyatta's 53%. However, Mr Odinga's allies remain confident that he will gain ground as results from his strongholds, including the Coast Province, are declared. More than 1,000 people were killed in the violence which broke out in 2007-08 after Mr Odinga claimed he had been cheated of victory by supporters of President Mwai Kibaki, who is stepping down after two terms in office. The BBC's Solomon Mugera in the capital, Nairobi, says Kenyans are becoming increasingly anxious about the delay in finalising the results. Some businesses and schools across the country have remained shut since Monday's election, he says. This has led to a shortage of goods, pushing up the prices of basic foodstuff in areas such as Kibera, the biggest slum in Nairobi and a stronghold of Mr Odinga, our correspondent adds. Uhuru Kenyatta Raila Odinga Profile: Uhuru Kenyatta Profile: Raila Odinga Some electoral officials have had to drive hundreds of kilometres to the counting centre in Nairobi to deliver paper copies of the tally of their returns. At about 13:00 local time, returning officers from only 53 of the 290 constituencies had arrived and the election commission said it would announce results from constituencies as they were ready. Its website had stopped giving updated results from the presidential race on Wednesday, and was still showing figures from Tuesday night. Our correspondent says the large number of spoiled ballots - about 6% of the total vote, well over double the number of votes cast for the third-placed candidate, Musailia Mudavadi - has become a major bone of contention. Mr Odinga's Coalition of Reforms and Democracy (Cord) wants them to be counted, but Mr Kenyatta's Jubilee Coalition is resisting this. Late on Tuesday, the election commission announced that the spoiled ballots would count in the overall vote total, increasing the likelihood of a run-off between the top two candidates, news agencies report. Mr Kenyatta's running mate William Ruto, who is also facing a trial at the ICC, said foreign embassies may have influenced such a decision. ""We want to believe that this is not an attempt to deny the Jubilee Coalition a first-round victory as is clearly now on the wall,"" he is quoted by Reuters news agency as saying.

Stage and TV actor Lord Rix, who specialised in post-war ""Whitehall farce"" comedies, is receiving 24-hour care in a retirement home. ""My position has changed.

""Unhappily, my body seems to be constructed in such a way that it keeps me alive in great discomfort when all I want is to be allowed to slip into a sleep, peacefully, legally and without any threat to the medical or nursing profession. ""I am sure there are many others like me who having finished with life wish their life to finish. ""Only with a legal euthanasia Bill on the statute books will the many people who find themselves in the same situation as me be able to slip away peacefully in their sleep instead of dreading the night.""

anthropic_stanford-online-all-v4-s3,"Mead, a honey-based drink, is becoming popular again in the US, but it still has a bad reputation.","But what's brewing in this new crop of commercial meaderies - as they are known - is lot more refined from the drink that once decorated tables across medieval Europe. ""Do we have any mead makers or home brewers in the group?"" asks Ben Alexander, eying a crowd of a dozen or so people who have come to his Maine Meade Works, in Portland, on a rainy Friday for a tour. When no-one raises their hand, Mr Alexander launches into the full spiel. ""If you guys want to come around, I'll show you how this thing works,"" he says, gesturing to two ceiling-high columns of stainless steel filled with something resembling a mushy golden porridge. ""We mix up honey and water over there and we pump it through a hot water bath at 160 degrees [71C] in a stainless steel coil here. Each one produces about 50 to 75 gallons [227-340 litres] of mead a day,"" explains Mr Alexander. It's fair to say he is obsessed with mead. ""It's the quintessential local beverage - you can go anywhere in the world and find honey to make mead, and I think that's unique among alcoholic beverages,"" he gushes. After being introduced to the drink by a home brewer, Mr Alexander thought there were profits to be had in a commercial meadery. He founded Maine Mead Works in 2008, pouring his savings and money from friends and family into the business. His business has since grown, along with the popularity of mead in the US. It's now a seven-person operation that manufactures more than 7,500 cases a year, shipping them as far away as China. Mr Alexander is not the only one to have caught on to the commercial potential of mead. Vicky Rowe, the owner of mead information website GotMead, says interest in the product in the US has exploded in the past decade. ""We went from 30-40 meaderies making mead to somewhere in the vicinity of 250 in the last 10 years,"" she says. ""I like to say that everything old is new again - people come back to what was good once."" Even visitors to Mr Alexander's meadery agree. Tour participant Dirk Heseman admitted that while Maine Mead Works was the first meadery he'd actually visited, he has noticed that mead ""is becoming more and more available - similar to cider"". Just this year, commercial meaderies in the US have banded together to form an industry group, the American Mead Makers Association, to better share information and encourage growth in the industry. But there's a lot of work that needs to be done to improve the image of a drink long associated with Renaissance fairs and medieval re-enactments. ""I think our number one challenge as an industry is awareness of what mead is,"" says Mr Alexander. ""You ask 10 people in a room if they've ever heard of mead, and two of them might say, 'yes', and only one of them has had a very positive experience.""

anthropic_stanford-online-all-v4-s3,Morocco has been readmitted to the African Union after it agreed to support a referendum on the future of Western Sahara.,"It was a ""good opportunity"" and ""a chance to work together,"" a top Western Sahara official told the BBC. Morocco controls two-thirds of Western Sahara and sees it as part of its historic territory. However some, including the UN, see Western Sahara as Africa's last colony. Africa Live: More on this and other stories Find out more about Western Sahara A referendum was promised in 1991 but never carried out due to wrangling over who was eligible to vote. Thousands of Sahrawi refugees still live in refugee camps in Algeria - some have been there for 40 years. It is not clear what happens next but Western Sahara is hopeful that a committee set up by the AU will address the issues that both sides have raised. Some AU delegates said that it would be easier to resolve the issue with Morocco inside the AU. Sidi Mohammed, a Western Sahara official, told the BBC that Morocco's return to the AU means that it would now be expected to put ""in practice decisions taken by the AU with regard to a referendum in Western Sahara"". Mr Mohammed dismissed the suggestion that Morocco would now seek to get the AU to change its position, saying that the no country could unilaterally change the AU fundamental agreement, saying it opposed colonisation. In his speech at the AU summit, King Mohammed VI of Morocco said the readmission was not meant to divide the continental body. No. Algeria has always been a big supporter of Western Sahara's Polisario Front and it had wanted Morocco to accept independence of the territory as a condition for readmission. Zimbabwe and South Africa were also supportive of this stance but they were outnumbered by those who wanted Morocco back in the fold. There is no specific provision in the AU charter that bars any country from joining it. Morocco simply applied and the request was accepted by more than two-thirds of the 53 members. Morocco has been involved in intense lobbying and applied in July last year to rejoin the continental body. King Mohammed toured various African countries seeking support for the bid. No. While culturally the country's identity aligns with Arab states, its economic interests increasingly lie in Africa. This is a strategic move to continue exploring its interests in mining, construction, medical, insurance and banking sectors on the continent.

anthropic_stanford-online-all-v4-s3,"Neil Lennon's appointment as Hibs manager is a mutually beneficial one, as he will be able to build on the club's success last season.","His previous jobs were at Celtic and Bolton, but moving to the second tier of Scottish football was no hindrance to him returning to work at Easter Road. Lennon saw the vacancy as an opportunity, and that was enough to encourage Hibs that a figure of his profile and experience would accept a role in the Championship. Even though his last job in Scotland involved leading a team on Champions League duty, Lennon's mind has not been swayed by haughtiness. The appointment of the former Celtic manager as successor to Alan Stubbs suits both parties, because it is mutually beneficial. Success is alluring, and Hibs offer Lennon the chance to accumulate more achievements. He was immediately engaged in crisis management at his previous club Bolton, but will find stability, potential and accomplishment at Easter Road. The demand will be to deliver promotion, but that will not seem daunting when the majority of the squad that pushed Rangers for a while last season then won the Scottish Cup is still in place. Lennon's task is to refine and bolster the team, when new managers are often faced with a period of overhaul. Stubbs left the club on an emotional high after delivering their first Scottish Cup in 114 years, but before the final against Rangers there was a tangible sense of exasperation that promotion had been missed. Hibs were entitled to feel that it was an unnecessary failure given their circumstances. The club is about to embark on a third season in the Championship, but by most other measures they can be considered a top-flight outfit. The budget will be significantly more than the rest of the teams in the division, the training ground at East Mains and facilities are first-class, the football side of the business is stable and well-run by George Craig, the club's head of football operations, the squad is full of talent. Lennon can rely on consistently assured performances from the likes of David Gray, Darren McGregor, Paul Hanlon, Lewis Stevenson, John McGinn, Fraser Fyvie, Dylan McGeouch, James Keatings and Jason Cummings. Some minor issues remain, such as who will fill the goal next season, but the challenge is more on adding depth and strength of will to the squad and man-management. McGinn, one of the most reliably effective players in the Championship last season, has already insisted that he remains committed to Hibs despite the failure to achieve promotion. The 21-year-old midfielder provides the kind of industry and spirit that a team can be built around. There may be critical decisions to make, though, since Cummings is entering the final year of his contract and so represents a sellable asset. He is a regular goalscorer, though, and Stubbs had to sign Anthony Stokes on loan last January to provide some support up front. These are tweaks compared to the amount of work Stubbs had to carry out when he was appointed two years ago. Hibs are ready to be guided forward, not waiting to be rescued.

The apes began to disappear from the documents about 150 years ago, corresponding with population growth. The study is published in the Proceedings of the Royal Society B. Hainan gibbons are now limited to a few isolated patches of forest in the south west of China. They live in just four social groups, one of which was only discovered a few weeks ago. Understanding this population crash has been difficult, but the old government documents have helped to reveal when and how the numbers fell. Dr Sam Turvey, from the Zoological Society of London, said: ""China is one of the few places in the world that has a very very rich, long historical record. ""Because it has had such a complex bureaucracy for so long, there has been a lot of need for reporting - not just numbers of households for tax purposes and things like that, but also in terms of the kinds of natural resources that were available in the immediate environment."" These included records of animals, including gibbons, he said. ""We looked at the pattern of disappearance of gibbons through time and how that varied from place to place and the different environmental conditions and human pressures that were also present in these places."" The archives show that gibbons were a common sight in about 20 provinces in China well into the 17th and 18th Century. However, Dr Turvey said it was ""a stark contrast to their very imperilled position today"". ""We see a really steep increase in population decline and real population collapse across China about 100-150 years ago,"" he added. ""And this correlates with demographic expansion in China towards the end of the Imperial era and through the 20th Century, and the massive increase in deforestation and human population growth through the time of the Chinese Republic and the establishment of the communist party."" The researchers said a better understanding of the animals' decline would help them to establish a conservation plan for the country's last few Hainan gibbons. Dr Turvey said: ""It is an incredible privilege to be able to see gibbons in China in the wild. ""The Hainan gibbon is such as rare species, but knowing that this species is still hanging on there gives you hope that conservation will be able to bring that population back from the brink.""

There have been conflicting claims about the precise nature of the row, but stewards were needed to calm the situation down after Chelsea's 2-1 win.

Internet companies will also be required to allow Russian authorities access to users' information. One human rights group called the move ""draconian"". The law was approved by Russia's upper house of parliament in April. It includes measures to ensure that bloggers cannot remain anonymous, and states that social networks must maintain six months of data on its users. The information must be stored on servers based in Russian territory, so that government authorities can gain access. Critics see it as the latest in a series of recent moves to curb internet freedom. Hugh Williamson, of New York-based Human Rights Watch, has called the law ""another milestone in Russia's relentless crackdown on free expression"". ""The internet is the last island of free expression in Russia and these draconian regulations are clearly aimed at putting it under government control,"" he added. Opposition figures have used the internet to air their views, with some gaining millions of followers. Commentators opposing Vladimir Putin often face restrictions in broadcast outlets and newspapers. Analysis: Famil Ismailov, news editor, BBCRussian.com Russian bloggers are bracing themselves for the moment when Russia's new ""information security law"" comes into force on 1 August. Some already share advice on how to use proxy servers in order to access social media sites that, in their view, are under threat of being closed. It is hard to see how the law will be enforced. The servers for most of the popular social media platforms that many Russians use are based outside Russia. Many popular bloggers are already looking for, and apparently finding, ways to ""cheat"" the feature that counts page visits and keep their daily unique visitor numbers just under 3000, or to make sure that the statistics are hidden altogether. Anton Nossik, who is considered Russia's ""internet guru"", wrote in his LiveJournal blog that the new law didn't threaten individual bloggers directly, but provided legal grounds to block popular social networks like Facebook, Twitter, LiveJournal and Google. ""The issue of banning all these platforms in Russia is a political one and it will be decided by only one person"", Mr Nossik wrote, with a thinly veiled reference to President Vladimir Putin. Earlier in the year, Russia enacted a law that gave the government powers to block websites without explanation. In March, Moscow blocked the blog of Mr Navalny, along with two news sites and a organisation run by Garry Kasparov - a vocal critic of the Russian government. In a statement, Russia's prosecutor general's office said the blocks were imposed because of the sites' role in helping stage illegal protests. Earlier this week, Twitter blocked access to an anti-Kremlin account that often publishes leaked government documents, following a request by Russia's federal communications agency Roskomnadzor. For many years, Russia had relatively lax internet laws. However Moscow has recently changed its tune, with Mr Putin branding the internet an ongoing ""CIA project"". He also claimed that",1,5,4

But his power, timing and focus returned in a supremely confident display at Glasgow's Hydro on Saturday night as he clinched the vacant WBA World Super-Lightweight title - and entered the record books as the first Scot to win world titles at three weights. Italy's Michele Di Rocco, at 34 a year older than Burns, hadn't lost a fight since September 2007. He arrived with a record of 40 wins and a draw from 42 bouts. He left a lesser figure. The referee deemed the man from Assisi to be in no state to continue in the eighth round, the result of a welter of blows to his head and body and made all the more unbearable by the hostile acoustic energy generated by 8,000 Scottish fans. Surely, for Burns, this was time to shout about his record, the ideal moment to counter all those who had written him off and questioned the wisdom of him leaving trainer Billy Nelson two years ago to work with Tony Sim in Essex? No. Instead, the champion spoke of his disbelief at the ease of his victory, his gratitude that he was safe, of his thanks to promoter Eddie Hearn, manager Alex Morrison and coach Sim for believing in him, and of his desire to celebrate with a fast-food burger and 20 chicken nuggets. ""When I got in the ring after the fight, I said, 'You've done it! You've done it!',"" reported a beaming Hearn at the post-fight media conference. ""And you know what Ricky said? 'Can you get a picture with me and Michael Buffer [the legendary American boxing ring announcer]?'"" When he has time to reflect during a well-earned holiday, Burns will take immense satisfaction at being only the third British-born fighter, after Bob Fitzsimmons and Duke McKenzie, to be a three-weight world champion. In Scottish terms, his achievements must mean that he is in the very top tier of boxing greats, comfortably mentioned in the same breath as former world champions Benny Lynch, Walter McGowan, Jackie Paterson, Ken Buchanan and Jim Watt, for example. Burns' record stands at 40 wins from 46 bouts. Remarkably, 11 of those have been world title fights. Buchanan's exploits in the United States add lustre to his legacy, but while Burns may never have fought someone like Roberto Duran, should Hearn manage to set up a bout against Cincinnati's Adrien Broner, the four-time world champion stripped of the WBA title because he could not make the weight, then Burns could achieve little more in the sport. ""There are some big fights out there for me,"" said Burns. ""I want to fight the top names. I will fight anybody. I do super-lightweight comfortably and lightweight is still an option. I would fight Terence Crawford again if it came down to it. ""That's nearly two years I have been with Tony and things have just started clicking.

It was the first time the 32-year-old Spaniard had driven the car for the Oxfordshire-based Marussia team. Inspectors from the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) visited the test track on Wednesday. Marussia said surgeons at Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge ""embarked on a lengthy procedure to address the serious head and facial injuries sustained by Maria in the accident"". It said: ""The operation began yesterday afternoon and she was in theatre until this morning. ""Maria remains in a critical but stable condition."" John Booth, team principal of the Marussia F1 Team, said: ""Maria emerged from theatre at Addenbrooke's Hospital this morning after a lengthy operation to address the serious head and facial injuries she received in the accident at Duxford Airfield yesterday.

""Maria's care and the wellbeing of her family remain our priority at this time. Her family are at the hospital and we are doing everything possible to support them."" De Villota sustained her injuries after her car ""suddenly accelerated"" into the back of the support lorry, according to witnesses. BBC Radio Cambridgeshire presenter Chris Mann, who saw the accident, said: ""The top of her car and her helmet seemed to take the brunt of it. ""She didn't move for about 15 minutes."" He said De Villota had been driving at up to 200mph during the testing, but the car was travelling considerably slower at the time of the crash. Mr Booth said: ""With regard to the accident, we have embarked on a very comprehensive analysis of what happened and this work continues for the moment."" Messages of support have come in from the motor racing world, including ones from Ferrari driver and fellow Spaniard Fernando Alonso and Jenson Button. Formula 1 driver and BBC analyst Jaime Alguersari said in his weekly column : ""I was shocked to hear of the accident suffered by Maria de Villota. I know her and her family very well.

anthropic_stanford-online-all-v4-s3,"Sportscotland has announced cuts to its funding, with fears that elite athletes could suffer.","sportscotland says it has yet to decide where the cuts will fall amid concerns that elite athletes could suffer. The cuts are being blamed on reduced government spending and a drop in National Lottery ticket sales - a major contributor to sports backing. Governing bodies are bracing themselves for potential job losses. About 60% of funding is made up from Scottish Government money, with lottery sales making up the rest. In the year ending 2015, total revenue was £65.1m, which is divided up and awarded to 52 sports. By the end of next year, that figure will have fallen to £51.8m - a cut to the Scottish sporting budget of 20% in just three years. sportscotland chairman Mel Young said: ""It's heartbreaking to me because I know the effort the sport governing bodies and the community that's around it; the volunteers and the mums and dads. ""And, to have to say that we're having to cut some money back is, I believe, not the right way to go."" Former badminton player Susan Egelstaff, a double bronze medallist at the Commonwealth Games [in 2002 and 2006] and an Olympian, fears the cuts will have ""a huge impact"". ""What that means in the future is that Scotland will be constantly playing catch-up,"" she said. ""It's almost impossible to catch up if you fall too far behind the leading nations."" The Scottish Government said sport and physical activity play a ""key role"" in a healthy Scotland and that ""significant"" investment would continue in those areas. ""Having successfully delivered the Commonwealth Games [in 2014] we are now focusing on protecting or raising investment in areas intended to decrease health inequality and improve life chances, and the small reduction in the sport budget allows us to support those priorities,"" Minister for Sport Aileen Campbell said. ""There is on-going support for active lifestyles through capital investment in cycling and walking, and over the last 10 years we have invested £168m in sport infrastructure - from grassroots to the elite performance which has increased the facilities and opportunities to get people active and achieve on the world stage at both the Olympics and Commonwealth Games.""",1,5,5
anthropic_stanford-online-all-v4-s3,St Johnstone beat bottom-of-the-table Inverness CT 3-0 to close the gap on third-placed Rangers to three points.,"Steven Maclean bundled home the opener five minutes before half-time. The hosts, slacker after the break, had beleaguered striker Larnell Cole sent-off after he confronted the referee. Liam Craig sealed the win from the penalty spot with two minutes to play, before Graham Cummins finished a sumptuous stoppage-time move. And things got worse still for Caley Thistle after the match, with captain Gary Warren shown a red card in the tunnel. Saints remain five points clear of Hearts in fourth place, and closed the gap on third-placed Rangers, who play Aberdeen on Sunday, to three points. With game after game ticking past, Inverness' position looks increasingly perilous. Next weekend's trip to Motherwell, second-bottom on goal difference, is now seismic. This contest turned nightmarish for the hosts after a bright opening, but the truth is, given their predicament, Caley Thistle did not threaten St Johnstone's goal enough. Billy Mckay sent a shot over from close range. Alex Fisher nodded a diving header wide. Carl Tremarco miscued a volley. Greg Tansey did draw a save from Alan Mannus when he rasped in an effort from outside the box, but Richie Foran's side never looked likely to find the net. Their best opportunity came immediately after the Saints went ahead, when Tansey fed Cole, who seemed to panic in a terrific position and shot straight at Mannus. Cole's dismissal ended the contest when he appeared to be cautioned twice for challenging referee Stephen Finnie's decision not to award a foul. St Johnstone were merciless and could have had more. With just one win from their last 21 league games, Inverness look deep in trouble. Tommy Wright's side deserve so much credit. Saints were tactically brilliant, so strong defensively and ruthlessly capitalised on their man advantage. They took one of their few first-half chances when Michael Coulson broke down the left and sent a dangerous ball across the six-yard box. Owain Fon Williams could only parry into the danger area, Cummins' shot was blocked but Maclean followed up to force it home. They should have had another when Craig's superb curling corner flew all the way to the back post where Cummins slid in and somehow knocked it over from two yards. Craig, in his 300th appearance for the club, coolly converted a spot-kick after Cummins was tripped to seal the points. Cummins then slammed home after Miller danced around the area to tee him up, before Craig cracked the bar amid the late flurry. With a tendency to finish the season strongly, and just a three-point gap to Rangers, the Perth side look capable of something special this term. Inverness CT manager Richie Foran: ""It is a tough time of the season to be sitting bottom, and I need real men to stand up to that, but not enough of them did that today. ""It is pure luck we are still in it and it is only four points. I sound like a broken record but one win changes it - that is the truth.

""We were [rehearsing] in the tent for about a week and a half, then we had to move to bigger studios in Hollywood where we are working on the rest of the show,"" she told Houston radio station Mix 96.5. ""And then we will send that equipment to Houston where we will finish rehearsals. Fans can expect a performance that spans my career so far."" She has a high standard to live up to - notably Prince's show in 2007, which took place in the middle of a Miami thunderstorm and is widely accepted as the greatest performance in the event's history, if not Prince's career. Here are some of the other most memorable - and surprising - moments from the last 30 years. Super Bowl performers get a very strict 12-minute time limit, so most performers cram their set with as much music as possible. Not Michael Jackson. After shooting onto the stage at the Pasadena Rose Bowl, he stood completely still, staring at the world for a full 90 seconds. Ninety. It was a master class in ratcheting expectation to a fever pitch. And the screams when he launched into Jam (not one of his best songs) proved he knew what he was doing. Brilliantly, Jackson staged this entire performance while wearing a jacket it looked like he'd borrowed from Muammar Gaddafi. Beat that, Gaga. Baby, he was born to run... and slide on his knees... and crotch slam a TV camera. In his autobiography, The Boss explains the incident like this: ""Too much adrenalin, a late drop, too much speed, here I come, Mikeâ€¦ BOOM! ""And I'm onto his camera, the lens implanted into my chest with one leg off the stage. I use his camera to push myself back up andâ€¦ BLAM! BORN TO RUN!"" It led to the memorable headline: ""America Attacked by Bruce Springsteen's crotch"" - but it didn't stop the star delivering one of the most powerful and energetic Super Bowl shows in recent history. Even if they were fined for over-running by 40 seconds. Coldplay were the headline act at last year's Super Bowl in Santa Clara - but someone forgot to tell Beyonce. She only performed one song, Formation, underscoring its message of black pride and power with back-up dancers dressed in leather body suits and black berets reminiscent of the Black Panthers movement. Some of her dancers were even pictured holding up a sign declaring ""Justice 4 Mario Woods"" - a 26-year-old black man who was shot dead by armed police in San Francisco two months earlier. The performance heralded the arrival of her unapologetically political album, Lemonade, later in the year.

Following on, he then made 68 in Surrey's 166-3 to keep Hampshire at bay and prompt handshakes at 16:50 BST. The draw sees third-placed Hampshire claim 12 points, while Surrey take 10 points and stay sixth in Division One. Burns' epic effort saw him stay in the field for all but 10 overs of the entire match, as he defied Hampshire's bowling efforts on a flat Oval pitch. The left-hander was dropped twice in the slip cordon in his career-best 219, but was the only one to resist as Ian Holland (3-37) dismissed Tom Curran (53), Amar Virdi and Mark Footitt to force the follow-on after Surrey began the day on 410-7. Mark Stoneman (47) and Burns then put on an opening stand of 109 before Holland's medium pace had Stoneman lbw and Scott Borthwick bowled in a single over. Sean Ervine became the only man to dismiss Burns in 756 minutes of play when he missed a ball down the leg side, but Jason Roy and Dominic Sibley continued on until the conclusion. Surrey captain Rory Burns told BBC Radio London: ""I'm really pleased that we've fought that hard to get the draw and the extra five points, and obviously pretty happy with how I've played. ""We had to bat seven sessions to get us to safety and that's all I was thinking. ""There were some jitters in the nineties and I got a lifeline, which was quite nice. When I was getting close to 200, I was more thinking about the situation of getting to the follow-on mark. ""They're a good side and they played really well.

The council said it would bring staff in line with the other 17,000 workers and ""reduce the risk"" of staff making claims for equal pay. Union Unison said it was ""bitterly disappointed"" with the decision. Regional officer, Helen Metcalf, said: ""This is a devastating blow for the 2,700 teaching assistants in the county, who now face being driven into poverty and relying on food banks through losing Â£200 - Â£400 per month of their salary."" She said there was ""no option"" but to lodge a formal dispute and ballot members for industrial action. Teaching assistant Tony Lowery, said: ""It is really devastating for my family because I'm the main wager. I don't mean things like going on holidays or a second car, I mean things like food on the table and clothes on our backs."" Liberal Democrat councillors voted unanimously against the plans. Councillor Owen Temple said the affected staff would ""find themselves the poorest teaching assistants in the North East"" and the council was ""very likely to face legal challenge"". The council's corporate director of resources, Don McLure, said there was a ""real risk"" that, under the present contracts, other council employees could make claims for equal pay with the teaching assistants. He said: ""I fully understand the position teaching assistants are in but they are very valued, they do a great job and support the education of our children, but we are doing this to bring them in line with the rest of our workforce.""

At the party's weekly press briefing, I asked the Welsh Conservative leader Andrew RT Davies, who was elected on the list, whether he'd stand as a constituency candidate in his home turf of the Vale of Glamorgan but he said he hadn't thought about it. Presumably those are the kind of decisions they will now feel more confident contemplating. The party will also have a huge amount of new data on voters which it'll be able to call upon and the belief that campaigning hard on the NHS helped the Tories cross the line in places like the Vale of Clwyd and Gower. The Conservatives feel it's them, rather than any of the other opposition parties, who have become the repository of votes from those who are disaffected by the state of the NHS. Welsh Labour are going to hold a ""short sharp"" analysis into what went wrong. Carwyn Jones was in line with most of the criticism of Ed Miliband when he told AMs that the party needed to appeal to small business owners who are not millionaires but who work hard. What will be more difficult is countering the argument on the NHS, which the former minister Alun Davies believes is already lost. Another potential difficulty for Welsh Labour will be dealing with unhappiness within the party over council re-organisation. Bernie Attridge, the deputy leader of Flintshire Council, has tweeted saying the party needs to be careful on local government reform if it wants to retain the support of grassroots councillors. It also seems to have been the case that Labour lost more votes to UKIP than the Conservatives, which is another challenge to overcome. But Labour will at least have the advantage that it will be David Cameron, and not Ed Miliband, carrying out the latest round of public sector cuts that are likely to take effect sooner rather than later. The question is whether Carwyn Jones is going to be able to turn that to his advantage when his own record in government will be under scrutiny. Plaid Cymru's education spokesman, Simon Thomas, also in the party's weekly press briefing, said he believed Leanne Wood could portray herself as an alternative first minister because of the way she emotionally connected with people in the campaign. The party now has a year to make that a credible proposition after it failed to gain any new seats and came fourth, behind UKIP, in the overall share of the vote, despite her unprecedented profile. He also said that on the campaign trail people wanted to know what Plaid was going to do about the NHS and that people ""did not see the strengths"" of its arguments.

But judges at the UK's highest court ruled against the scheme in July 2016, citing concerns over information sharing. The Supreme Court judges said some proposals breached rights to privacy and a family life under the European Convention on Human Rights.

A reading below 50 indicates falling output. It is the first time that activity in the sector has fallen since March 2013. Firms blamed soft domestic demand, a fall in new business from overseas and uncertainty ahead of the EU referendum. A slowdown in the oil and gas industry, a major customer for UK companies, is also hitting production. The index for new orders fell to 50.4 in April, from 51.9 the month before, matching February's three-year low. Rob Dobson, senior economist at Markit, said: ""On this evidence manufacturing production is now falling at a quarterly pace of around 1%, and will likely act as a drag on the economy again during the second quarter and putting greater pressure on the service sector to sustain GDP growth. ""The manufacturing labour market is also being impacted, with the data signalling close to 20,000 job losses over the past three months."" Last week, official figures showed UK economic growth slowed to 0.4% in the first quarter of the year from 0.6% in late 2015, propped up by the services sector. David Noble, group chief executive at the Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply (CIPS), said: ""Recent fears over a stall in the UK's manufacturing sector have now become a reality. ""An atmosphere of deep unease is building throughout the manufacturing supply chain, eating away at new orders, reducing British exports and putting more jobs at risk. ""A sense of apprehension across the sector is being caused by enduring volatility in the oil and gas industry, falling retailer confidence and the uncertainty created by the EU referendum."" The Markit/CIPS survey found new export orders contracted for the fourth straight month in April as the global economy continued to slow. A measure of employment in the manufacturing sector was also below the 50 mark for its fourth straight month. Lee Hopley, chief economist at the manufacturers' organisation, EEF, said: ""The sharp drop to a three-year low and another month of reported job cuts could be the clearest sign yet that referendum uncertainty is starting to weigh on the real economy.

The case, known as King v Burwell, was the second major challenge the law has faced in the US's highest court. Unlike in many other western countries, the US does not have a single-payer healthcare system. Private companies, rather than the US government, provide health insurance for US citizens. The enactment of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) - one of Mr Obama's most significant and controversial domestic achievements - in 2010 mandated that every American had to purchase private insurance. It provided the subsidies to allow many to do so. In 2012, the mandate portion of the law was challenged in the court. The justices ruled to preserve it. In that decision, as in the decision on Thursday, Chief Justice John Roberts surprised observers by siding with his liberal colleagues in support of the law. ""Congress passed the Affordable Care act to improve health insurance markets, not to destroy them,"" Chief Justice John Roberts wrote in the opinion. Justice Anthony Kennedy dissented in 2012, but sided with the majority on Thursday. Had the court made the opposite decision, an estimated 8.7 million people in the US would have been at risk of losing the aid that makes healthcare affordable. The stakes could not have been higher. People's health (crucially important) and Obama's legacy (less important, but for him and those around him fairly vital) were at stake. Well a politically finely balanced Supreme Court has given an emphatic, overwhelming vote in favour of the president by 6-3. I bet ""No-drama Obama"" is high-fiving anyone and everyone in the White House - that is how big it is. Obama defies lame-duck expectations Demonstrators gathered outside the court as early on Thursday morning. Reading updates on their mobile phones, the crowd became jubilant when they learned mid-morning that the court had ruled in their favour. Some began dancing, while others chanted ""If you're covered and you know it clap your hands."" ""This is a big sigh of relief for millions across the country,"" said Ron Pollack of Families USA, a health-care advocacy organisation. ""The ACA is not just the law of the land, it will remain the law of the land"". ""Today is a good day for healthcare in America,"" said activist Benton Strong. ""I hope this is the end of the line."" Demonstrators opposing the subsidies did not have a large visible presence. Justice Antonin Scalia wrote in his dissent that the Supreme Court is setting a precedent of favouring some laws over others. ""We should start calling this law Scotuscare"" Justice Scalia wrote, referring to the court's acronym. ""Today's interpretation is not merely unnatural; it is unheard",1,5,5

The Vatican usually responds within six weeks to approve such a new ambassador. The nomination of Mr Stefanini was seen as a litmus test for Pope Francis, who has taken a more liberal stance on homosexuality. A French government spokesman said there had been negotiations with the Vatican over the appointment. ""France has chosen its ambassador to the Vatican. This choice was Stefanini and that remains the French proposal,"" said spokesman Stephane Le Foll. Observers say most Vatican appointments are confirmed within six weeks and that this long silence should be read as a rejection. The Vatican traditionally makes no statement if it intends to decline a nomination. Mr Stefanini served in the Holy See as a deputy ambassador in the French embassy from 2001 to 2005. He was described by the country's foreign ministry as ""one of our best diplomats"". France legalised same-sex marriage in 2013, despite opposition from the Catholic Church. Pope Francis is regarded as more tolerant of homosexuality than previous popes. ""Who am I to judge?"", he said in 2013.",1,4,4

He said he would now look at the 125 existing marine protected areas to see if further improvements could be made. The Marine Conservation Society (MCS) described it as an ""embarrassing U-turn"" for the Welsh government, and has called for better protection of seas. Creating the zones would mean a ban on fishing and anchoring in some areas and had brought opposition. The Welsh Fishermen's Association said previously that existing conservation networks for Welsh waters are adequate. The Welsh government proposed the zones last year with the backing of the Countryside Council of Wales and the Marine Conservation Society. The minister for natural resources said the decision had been made after the thousands of responses to the consultation brought ""divergent and strongly held views"". Mr Davies said to ""avoid any continuing uncertainty over the options presented in the 2012 consultation, I am also withdrawing all the proposed sites"". His comments come after the findings were published of a task and finish team which reviewed the feedback. Now, he will concentrate on the existing 125 Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) that cover 36% of Welsh seas to see if any changes can be made rather than creating additional zones. ""We are now in a stronger position to assess our current contribution to the network's ecological coherence,"" he said. ""I have, therefore, commissioned an assessment of our current MPAs to identify if there are any gaps and what the options might be to fill those gaps. ""If any measures are required, I believe they should be simple, proportionate and fit for purpose."" Dr Peter Richardson, biodiversity programme manager for MCS, said the Welsh government ""spent an awful lot of time and money and encouraged other people to put effort into this consultation response"". He said: ""70% of the consultation responses were in favour of designating these sites and yet today the minister has announced he's scrapping the whole thing... bit of an embarrassing U-turn for the government I think."" He added: ""I think there are plenty of people in the fishing industry... that understand that in order to get the best yields from the marine habitats on which they depend, they have to be managed properly.""",1,5,5

She will take on a new role on the clinic's Northern Ireland advisory board. Last November, anti-abortion protester Bernadette Smyth, who leads the Precious Life group, was convicted of harassing Ms Purvis at the Marie Stopes office in Belfast city centre.

Senior coroner John Leckey is retiring this year and told a preliminary hearing of the inquest in Belfast that no replacement has been appointed. His retirement could leave only one coroner in Northern Ireland. Kingsmill is among dozens of inquests dating from the early days of the Troubles that face delay because not enough money is available to investigate or there is nobody to oversee fresh hearings. Mr Leckey said: ""I feel for the bereaved families, not exclusively Kingsmill but for other inquests I am involved in. ""It is a disappointment that is widespread."" A lawyer for some of the Kingsmill victims' families said they would be pressing Stormont's justice department for more resources to allow an inquest to go ahead. Karen Armstrong, a sister of one of the murdered men, said the lack of resources was ""a political problem"". ""We are not going to lie down and accept it,"" she said. ""We will fight until we get another date and they have to make sure there are enough coroners in Northern Ireland to deal with our and many other cases."" Ulster Unionist MLA Danny Kennedy said he would be asking Justice Minister David Ford to ensure the matter was referred to the relevant authorities so that ""action can be taken as soon as possible"". ""Justice has been denied for almost 40 years and it is totally unacceptable that this inquest should be delayed further due to the unavailability of a coroner,"" he said. ""This was one of the most shocking and cruel events of the Troubles and the inquest must be treated with the seriousness this crime merits.""

The couple spoke out in response to consultation on proposed reform of sentencing for driving offences. They believe increased sentences should be backed up by manslaughter charges. Mr Moores, 28, was killed by a Vauxhall Astra driven by Donna Hackett on the M4 near Swindon. Hackett, then aged 26, fled and was found by police asleep in a ditch. She served half of a six-year jail term after she was found guilty of causing death by careless driving while drunk. The Ministry of Justice consultation suggests offenders who cause death by careless driving while under the influence of drink or drugs could soon be handed a life sentence - an increase on the current 14-year upper limit. Source: Crown Prosecution Service But Mr and Mrs Moores, from Chandlers Ford, Hampshire, also want the offence to be upgraded to a charge of manslaughter. Mr Moores said: ""Somebody can drive drunk and kill my son. Why is that not manslaughter? ""Nothing can prepare a parent for seeing their child in the mortuary. That will stay with me every day, every day that vision comes into my mind. ""Our life is ruined."" Mrs Moores added: ""There's nothing careless about drink driving. I don't want anybody else to feel like us."" Ms Hackett, who lived in Radnor Street, Swindon, at the time of the offence, appealed against her sentence in September 2011, but was refused. A Ministry of Justice spokesperson said: ""We are determined to make sure those who kill whilst driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs face the full force of the law. ""That is why we are consulting on plans that will see the maximum sentence for a number of offences in this area increase from 14 years to life.""

Their intention in travelling to the region, where areas are controlled by Islamic State (IS) militants or an al-Qaeda affiliate, is not clear. The Foreign Office has said it is in contact with the Turkish authorities. The BBC's Mark Lowen said the information about the ages of the children had not been independently verified and it was too early to know where the group were intending to head to. ""Were they heading for one of the more moderate groups in Syria. Were they heading for the area controlled by al-Nusra, the al-Qaeda affiliate? Or were they heading to so-called Islamic State territory?"" he said. The group was taken to a police station in southern Turkey overnight, and then sent to the foreigners department awaiting deportation to the UK. They have undergone medical examinations and had their finger-prints taken. The United Nations estimates the number of foreign fighters joining militant groups is more than 25,000, from 100 different nations. About 600 Britons are believed to have gone to Syria or Iraq since IS seized control of large swathes of territory there. Most are thought to have volunteered as fighters for the militant Islamist group. Around half are believed to have later returned to the UK, the Metropolitan Police has said. The latest detentions come two weeks after three British teenagers were stopped from travelling into Syria from Turkey. The three - two aged 17 and one 19, from north-west London - were arrested following a tip-off from British police and flown back to the UK. They have since been released on police bail. They had flown to Turkey from Barcelona and were arrested at Sabiha Gokcen airport in Istanbul. Fadi Hakura, Turkey analyst for Chatham House, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the recent arrests showed the Turkish government was ""taking more effective measures to control the flow of fighters and supporters into Syria"". He said there was now ""more enhanced security and intelligence cooperation between Turkey and its Western counterparts, especially with the exchange of names that Turkey needs to prohibit [IS supporters] from crossing into Syria"". The Turkish government has said it cannot make a 560-mile border watertight and will act when it has prior warning. In February this year there were recriminations between British police and Turkish officials after three London schoolgirls disappeared from Turkey, apparently having crossed the border into Syria. Shamima Begum, Amira Abase, both 15, and Kadiza Sultana, 16 had flown to Istanbul and travelled to the border region.

Wrockwardine Wood and Sutherland academies, also run by the Telford Co-operative Multi-Academy Trust, were put in special measures earlier this week. The trust has not commented. Ofsted criticised the trust's lack of support to the schools and said each was now considering an alternative sponsor. Inspectors said pupils' achievement at the Phoenix Academy had dropped since it became an academy in 2013 and their latest report rated it inadequate in all areas. A report in 2013, before it converted, rated the secondary school as ""requiring improvement"", while Lakeside was rated ""good"" in 2012 under its former name the Lord Silkin School. In the latest report, inspectors said the curriculum at Phoenix Academy was ""inadequate"", while ""weak teaching"" meant pupils were not sufficiently challenged and were often ""disengaged and disruptive"". There was particular criticism of standards in English and maths which the watchdog said were limiting pupils' achievements in other areas. Ofsted's report said governors, managers and teachers had developed a ""culture of low expectations"", while leaders had failed to act decisively to halt the decline in pupils' achievement. There was, however, some praise for the acting head teacher. Inspectors said he had introduced a number of improvement measures and some were ""beginning to have an impact"". A report on Lakeside School highlighted similar concerns, criticising teachers for not sufficiently challenging pupils and for having ""over generous"" predictions of their achievement. Inspectors said many pupils, whether high achievers or those with special educational needs, were ""not making the progress they should"" and achievements at GCSE were well below the national average. Governors were also criticised for not holding leaders to account, while the report said management had failed to effectively monitor either pupils or teachers.

In response, Number 10 said there were ""many difficult challenges"" in Libya, while the White House said it deeply valued the UK's contributions. Downing Street did not comment on President Obama's remark to the PM about defence spending, reportedly made before Chancellor George Osborne said the government would fulfil a Nato pledge to spend 2% of national income on defence last year. In response to the interview, a spokesman for the US National Security Council said Mr Cameron had been ""as close a partner as the president has had"" adding that ""we deeply value the UK's contributions on our shared national security and foreign policy objectives"". BBC North America editor Jon Sopel said the unsolicited statement put out by the White House suggested Downing Street had reacted angrily to the article. ""It's like we've seen a curtain drawn back on the unspun thoughts of President Obama, complete with frustration as well, and what we've seen tonight is the White House trying to close the curtain as quickly as it can,"" he added. The toppling of the Gaddafi regime in Libya - following UN-backed air strikes designed to protect civilians - led to a power vacuum and instability, with no authority in full control. The intervention was led by the UK and France - and in his interview, Mr Obama reflects on ""what went wrong"", saying: ""There's room for criticism, because I had more faith in the Europeans, given Libya's proximity, being invested in the follow-up."" Mr Cameron, he said, became ""distracted by a range of other things"". He also criticised former French President Nicolas Sarkozy, saying he had tried to claim the spotlight. The former French president, he said, ""wanted to trumpet the flights he was taking in the air campaign, despite the fact that we had wiped out all the air defences and essentially set up the entire infrastructure"" for the intervention. President Obama said the intervention ""averted large-scale civilian casualties (and) prevented what almost surely would have been a prolonged and bloody civil conflict"". But he added: ""And despite all that, Libya is a mess."" He also criticised what he called ""free riders"" in the interview, saying European and Gulf countries were calling for action against Gaddafi, adding: ""But what has been a habit over the last several decades in these circumstances is people pushing us to act but then showing an unwillingness to put any skin in the game."" Despite efforts to support Libya's National Transitional Council, and the first elections in the country for decades, it rapidly descended into violence, with two rival governments and the formation of hundreds of militias, some allied to so-called Islamic State.

But he also raised concerns about possible damage to the site over plans to build a road tunnel past Stonehenge. The Department of Transport said it would ""consult before any building"". The Blick Mead site is about 1.5 miles (2.4km) from Stonehenge and archaeologists said ""scientifically tested charcoal"" dug up from the site had ""revealed that it dated from around 4000 BC"". David Jacques said the dig had also found ""evidence of feasting"" including burnt flints, tools and remains of giant cattle, known as aurochs, which were eaten by early hunter gatherers. Mr Jacques said: ""British pre-history may have to be rewritten. This is the latest dated Mesolithic encampment ever found in the UK. ""Blick Mead site connects the early hunter gatherer groups returning to Britain after the Ice Age to the Stonehenge area, all the way through to the Neolithic in the late 5th Millennium BC. ""But our only chance to find out about the earliest chapter of Britain's history could be wrecked if the tunnel goes ahead."" Andy Rhind-Tutt, a former mayor and current chairman of Amesbury Museum, which part-funded the dig, said the discovery could ""provide what archaeologists have been searching for centuries - the answer to the story of the pre-history of Stonehenge."" Earlier this month, the government announced funding for a 1.8-mile (2.9km) tunnel to remove congestion from the main road past Stonehenge. A Department for Transport spokesman said: ""As with any road scheme, we will consult with interested parties before any building begins on the A303. ""English Heritage and National Trust are supportive of our plans, and we will ensure sites of cultural or historical significance are safeguarded as we progress with the upgrade.""",1,3,3
brio,"A 4,000-year-old shelter has been uncovered at a site near Stonehenge in Wiltshire.","The shelter - in a hollow left behind by a fallen tree - at Blick Mead was used over a 90-year period from 4336 BC, it is believed. Archaeologist David Jacques, said: ""They... used the stump of the tree, about three metres high, as a wall."" The finds are being shown to United Nations heritage experts, who are currently visiting Stonehenge. Archaeologists are concerned a planned 2.9km tunnel being considered for the nearby A303 main road will damage the site. Discoveries have also shown stones were warmed up by the Mesolithic Period inhabitants and used in a hearth to emit heat in the earthy snug. Mr Jacques, a senior research fellow at the University of Buckingham, has worked at Blick Mead for over a decade, making a number of discoveries about the inhabitants. The tree stump created a wall height similar to a ""modern bungalow"". ""They've draped probably animal skins or thatch around the basin and connected it to a post so it's a very comfortable snug little place,"" he said. The wooden wall of the hollow was lined with flints and the large earthy pit created by the tree root lined with cobbles and decorated with ""exotic"" stones from outside the area. ""There are some clever and sophisticated things going on, the hot stones that they put into this little type of alcove wouldn't have been on fire,"" explained Mr Jacques. ""It looks more like these people have been using these hot stones as a type of storage heater so that you've got a lot of warmth coming off them."" Mr Jacques will meet the UN experts later to ask for the route to be moved closer to Salisbury and for hydrological assessments to be made. ""It's very likely the water flow would be reduced in and around the site,"" he said. ""It would take out all the organics and destroy all the animal bone we've been finding which is crucial for finding where they have been living and for getting radiocarbon dates from all the organics like pollen and wood. ""This is massively important for reconstructing what the landscape would have looked like."" Andy Rhind-Tutt, former mayor and chairman of Amesbury Museum and Heritage Trust said: ""I sincerely hope the team delivering the long-awaited A303 improvement look seriously at an alternative alignment south of Salisbury and away from this unequalled archaeological landscape.

State media picked up the story on Thursday, which was first reported in a local evening paper earlier this week. Liaoshen Wanbao reported the 49-year-old woman in Shenyang city had claimed her husband had divorced her 10 years ago because he disliked the shape of her face, said to be ""large and square"" with ""fat cheeks"". She said it spurred her to undergo facial surgery three times at a local hospital to shave her jawbones and reshape her face into a slimmer shape. During the third surgery the doctors discovered that if they proceeded further her nerves may be damaged, and halted the procedure. The woman, identified only by her surname Wang, later sued the hospital for 1.7 million yuan ($260,900; Â£183,900) in damages. She alleged the surgery had left her with soreness in her chin, and she could only eat and drink through a straw as ""when she exerted force on her lower jaw, she had the sensation that it would break"". The hospital, however, argued that the surgeries were conducted according to regulations, and pointed out that they encouraged her to seek psychiatric help instead of a third operation, which she refused. After mediation the woman agreed to accept 20,000 yuan ($3,100, Â£2,200) as compensation, said the report. On Weibo, some condemned the woman's husband, but others also chastised the woman. One top-voted comment read: ""It's purely an excuse, if her face was large then why did he decide to marry her in the first place? If he stopped loving her then he should have just said so."" It continued: ""This woman is also very silly to have believed that her face shape was the real reason for the divorce, she is lying to herself."" Said another Weibo user: ""Even if you had gone for facial surgery and made your face smaller, he would still have found other reasons to divorce you."" One person noted the sharp difference in the compensation amount and voiced suspicions: ""1.7 million was dropped to 20,000, it makes me wonder if she really did have a problem with her jaw."" Still others took the opportunity to crack jokes. ""What an odd reason for divorce! I wonder how square was this woman's square-shaped face? Like a television set? Microwave oven?"" Plastic surgery has long been a hot topic on Weibo. In December, users similarly expressed outrage when a Chinese man took out a newspaper advertisement pleading for his wife to go for plastic surgery. More than seven million cosmetic surgeries were performed in China in 2014. The industry's value, pegged at around 400bn yuan, is expected to double by 2019, according to the China Association of Plastics and Aesthetics.",1,5,5

brio,A council is to seek a High Court injunction to stop a councillor taking part in tree-felling protests.,"Nether Edge Green Party councillor, Alison Teal, was served with a legal notice for her involvement in protests against Sheffield City Council's tree felling programme. Ms Teal was previously arrested for protesting against the tree removals. Charges against her and 13 others were dropped earlier this year. More stories from across Yorkshire Sheffield City Council maintain that the removal of street trees in the city is lawful and necessary. A ""pre-action protocol letter"" from the council's legal department to Ms Teal warned the authority will seek a High Court injunction to stop her, and others involved in ""direct action"", from taking part in future protests. The council said the process would give protesters ""a chance to further and finally consider their position"" before it begins legal proceedings on 12 July. Councillor Bryan Lodge, cabinet member for Environment and Street Scene, said there had been months of ""unlawful and costly disruption"" to tree replacement works in Sheffield by a small number of protesters. ""We continue to support the right to peacefully protest, and the majority of protesters who are doing so peacefully will not be affected,"" he added. ""But there is a big difference between this and direct action which deliberately and unlawfully stops works from being carried out."" Mr Lodge said protesters had been sent a letter several weeks ago confirming their actions were unlawful. ""Streets Ahead is not just about street trees, it's about ensuring we have roads, pavements and a street scene to be proud of for many years to come,"" he added. ""In addition, it presents us with a unique opportunity to sustainably manage, increase and maintain our diverse street tree stock over a 25 year period."" The council said, despite the letter, works were still being disrupted ""causing city-wide delays"".",1,4,5

brio,A deputy head teacher at a school at the centre of the so-called Trojan Horse affair has been cleared of any wrongdoing.,"Asif Kahn, who worked at Oldknow Academy in Birmingham, had faced allegations of misconduct. A National College of Teaching and Leadership panel heard the allegations against him in November, although Mr Khan did not appear at the hearing. The Professional Conduct Panel has said it did not find the case proven. Oldknow Academy was one of several schools investigated amid claims of a Muslim hardliners' plot to control them; known as the Trojan Horse affair. More on this and other stories from Birmingham and the Black Country Mr Khan had been accused of agreeing ""to the inclusion of an undue amount of religious influence in the education of pupils"" at Oldknow, on or before 31 July 2014. The accusations had included telling some male pupils to change for PE in a cupboard so they would not show their thighs, banning children singing during a production of The Wizard of Oz and turning his back on a woman as she offered to shake his hand. He was also accused of sharing his personal beliefs with the children, for example telling the children they were not allowed pet dogs as they were Muslim. A fellow teacher, former-acting head teacher Jahangir Akbar, was banned from teaching indefinitely in January, although he can apply to have his ban set aside in five years time.",1,5,5
brio,A firefighter has been sacked after a woman died in a house fire which took more than an hour for a fire engine to arrive.,"The man, who has not been named, was dismissed following disciplinary proceedings, Devon and Somerset Fire Service said. Molly Wigmore, 76, died in the fire at her Plymouth home in October last year. The first 999 call was made at 05:17 GMT but none had arrived by the time a second call was made at 06:44, ahead of a fire engine arriving at 06:50. Ms Wigmore's house, in Sussex Road, is about a mile and a half from Camels Head Fire Station. An inquest is expected to examine whether the delay played any part in her death, on 19 October. The fire service said in a statement it was unable to comment on the case until the inquest was over. ""We continue to offer the family of the deceased our deepest condolences,"" the service added. Tributes left at the house said Ms Wigmore was an ""inspirational, kind, gentle and sweet lady"".",1,4,5
brio,A fountain in Hertfordshire is to be refilled to celebrate the Queen's Diamond Jubilee and the Olympic Games.,"The Coronation Fountain, a landmark in Welwyn Garden City, had to be turned off due to the hosepipe ban. However, the council is now paying Â£450 to fill it up again, so that the town looks its best for key 2012 events. It will be working on the 4 and 5 June and when the Olympic torch relay passes through the borough on 8 July. The fountain on Parkway in the town was built to celebrate the Queen's accession to the throne in 1952. It is supplied by an underground tank, but had to be switched off after the water level dropped and could not be refilled. The council is buying water from a landscaping firm which already supplies water from a natural lake source, to maintain the borough's open spaces. It cannot be drunk so is permitted under the hosepipe ban regulations. Council chief executive, Michel Saminaden, said: ""They have told us that there is an abundance of water in this lake so we are probably doing them a favour by taking it."" Mr Saminaden added that the council decided against asking the Veolia water company for a special dispensation. ""I thought that wasn't the right thing to do because we would be using precious water,"" he said. ""What we are doing now is using water that is surplus and we have been told categorically that there is no problem in using it. This is a better all round sustainable solution. ""I am extremely pleased that we have been able to find a solution which will enable everybody to see the fountain in all its glory on the occasion of these two great celebrations.""",0,5,3

brio,A friend of the author of To Kill a Mockingbird has told the BBC how the book's author once told him why she didn't write any more.,"Harper Lee's classic was published 50 years ago this summer and it remains the only novel she ever wrote. Lee, 84, has never explained why she stopped writing. She doesn't give interviews - ""Hell, no"" was her response to a request several decades ago - and that silence has only added to the intrigue. But her close friend Thomas Lane Butts, a retired minister in her hometown, Monroeville, Alabama, says she once told him the reason. Sitting on a pew in the Methodist church which the Lee family still attends, he described to me how she suddenly brought the subject up one night over dinner in New York. ""She asked me, 'You ever wonder why I didn't write anything else?' And I said, 'Along with several million other people, yes, I had wondered about that.' And she said, 'Well, what do you think?'"" Speaking in his slow southern drawl, the Rev Butts, who just turned 80, suggested to her that she had already written a great book and therefore didn't need to compete with herself. ""And when I got through she said, 'You're all wrong.' I said, 'Alright, smart Alec. You tell me.' She said, 'I would not go through all the deprivation of privacy through which I went for this book again for any amount of money.' ""And she said, 'I did not need to write another book. I said what I wanted to say in that book.'"" Harper Lee called it a simple tale about the ""conflict of the human soul"" and Monroeville, Alabama, is where she drew her inspiration. The story depicts the segregated South of her childhood, during the Depression. It was published at the height of the civil rights struggle. The Rev Butts grew up 10 miles outside Monroeville. By the late 1950s, he says, he was a ""fuzzy-cheeked young preacher"" campaigning for an end to segregation. He had met Martin Luther King Jr and signed a petition to boycott buses. The Ku Klux Klan had left a burning cross on his front lawn. He says To Kill a Mockingbird was not well received in Monroeville when it was published. ""The people who were hard racist did not like it because of the implication of the book,"" the Rev Butts told me. ""The book revealed racism and that always frightens a racist - when you pull the cover off them. ""Those of us who stood up for civil rights were much encouraged by the book because in a very skilful and subtle way it addressed itself for justice."" But these days, the Rev Butts says, there is enormous civic pride in Monroeville. The old courthouse, which Hollywood re-created for the film, now houses a museum to Harper Lee and the town's other literary icon, Truman Capote. Capote was a childhood friend of hers and is thought to be the inspiration for the Dill character in To Kill a Mockingbird. The town's residents often try to protect Lee, allowing her to live a normal life instead of being hounded by fans or bothered with prying questions. ""Being famous",1,5,4
brio,"A group of 10 Britons have been detained in Turkey trying to travel to Syria, the BBC understands.","The group, reported to be three men, two women and four children aged from two to 11, was held at Reyhanli, in Hatay province, near the Syrian border. Their intention in travelling to the region, where areas are controlled by Islamic State (IS) militants or an al-Qaeda affiliate, is not clear. The Foreign Office has said it is in contact with the Turkish authorities. The BBC's Mark Lowen said the information about the ages of the children had not been independently verified and it was too early to know where the group were intending to head to. ""Were they heading for one of the more moderate groups in Syria. Were they heading for the area controlled by al-Nusra, the al-Qaeda affiliate? Or were they heading to so-called Islamic State territory?"" he said. The group was taken to a police station in southern Turkey overnight, and then sent to the foreigners department awaiting deportation to the UK. They have undergone medical examinations and had their finger-prints taken. The United Nations estimates the number of foreign fighters joining militant groups is more than 25,000, from 100 different nations. About 600 Britons are believed to have gone to Syria or Iraq since IS seized control of large swathes of territory there. Most are thought to have volunteered as fighters for the militant Islamist group. Around half are believed to have later returned to the UK, the Metropolitan Police has said. The latest detentions come two weeks after three British teenagers were stopped from travelling into Syria from Turkey. The three - two aged 17 and one 19, from north-west London - were arrested following a tip-off from British police and flown back to the UK. They have since been released on police bail. They had flown to Turkey from Barcelona and were arrested at Sabiha Gokcen airport in Istanbul. Fadi Hakura, Turkey analyst for Chatham House, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the recent arrests showed the Turkish government was ""taking more effective measures to control the flow of fighters and supporters into Syria"". He said there was now ""more enhanced security and intelligence cooperation between Turkey and its Western counterparts, especially with the exchange of names that Turkey needs to prohibit [IS supporters] from crossing into Syria"". The Turkish government has said it cannot make a 560-mile border watertight and will act when it has prior warning. In February this year there were recriminations between British police and Turkish officials after three London schoolgirls disappeared from Turkey, apparently having crossed the border into Syria. Shamima Begum, Amira Abase, both 15, and Kadiza Sultana, 16 had flown to Istanbul and travelled to the border region. Turkish officials said they had not been warned promptly enough by British police to intercept them - Scotland Yard denied this.",0,5,4
brio,A man has admitted killing his estranged wife as she slept in their home.,"Asghar Buksh, 55, repeatedly struck mother-of-six Nasreen Buksh over the head with a heavy blunt object which has never been found. He admitted culpable homicide on the basis of diminished responsibility after saying he had no recollection of the killing at Dixon Avenue, Glasgow, on 24 September last year. Buksh will be sentenced on 27 June. The High Court in Glasgow heard that 43-year-old Mrs Buksh died after being struck on the head at least five times. Pathologists told the court that the lack of defensive injuries and the position of her body suggested she was assaulted as she slept. Following the attack, Buksh went to Cathcart Police Station and told an officer: ""I've come to hand myself in. I think my wife's dead. I hit her on the head. I did it."" The court was told that three psychiatrists described Buksh as suffering from an acute stress disorder at the time. Prosecutor Gordon Lamont said: ""The accused and his wife had been married for 25 years, but over the last 10 or 11 years their relationship appears to have broken down and they became increasingly estranged, albeit, still residing under the one roof. ""They slept separately and Mrs Buksh routinely slept on the sofa in the living room. Their children report that they barely spoke to each other."" Mr Lamont said the problems in the marriage intensified after Mrs Buksh went to Pakistan on holiday in May last year. He said she had become involved with another man and was making plans to move to Pakistan. The court also heard that two days before he killed his wife, Buksh went to Paisley Police Office and spoke with a support officer saying he feared his wife was going to take their youngest child, aged 10, to Pakistan and not return. He also made an emergency doctor's appointment and said he was suffering from stress and not sleeping. He was prescribed medication for stress. Defence counsel Sarah Livingstone said: ""My client has no memory of this incident. His amnesia is absolutely genuine. ""This is not a case where this man was a bad husband, there was no domestic abuse. This was an unhappy marriage, but however, unhappy it was it didn't justify killing his wife. ""He suffered an acute stress reaction. Three psychiatrists all agree that he was suffering from an abnormality of the mind."" Judge Lord Burns deferred sentence on Buksh until 27 June at the High Court in Edinburgh for background reports.",1,5,5

Mr Jones, who had held a licence for more than 30 years, appealed against the decision and won. Caernarfon Crown Court heard on Friday that he was not a cause for concern despite the posts. The hearing was told a senior police officer regarded the posts as ""highly offensive"", prompting the licence to be revoked. Judge Niclas Parry said Mr Jones was ignorant about the subject of the Muslim faith, but added: ""None of those messages were created by the appellant. ""The appellant has liked certain messages that appeared on his Facebook profile. He has then effectively re-published the message.""",1,5,5
brio,A new law has come into force in Russia that tightens regulations on the internet and social media.,"It means bloggers with more than 3,000 daily readers must register with the mass media regulator, Roskomnadzor, and conform to the regulations that govern the country's larger media outlets. Internet companies will also be required to allow Russian authorities access to users' information. One human rights group called the move ""draconian"". The law was approved by Russia's upper house of parliament in April. It includes measures to ensure that bloggers cannot remain anonymous, and states that social networks must maintain six months of data on its users. The information must be stored on servers based in Russian territory, so that government authorities can gain access. Critics see it as the latest in a series of recent moves to curb internet freedom. Hugh Williamson, of New York-based Human Rights Watch, has called the law ""another milestone in Russia's relentless crackdown on free expression"". ""The internet is the last island of free expression in Russia and these draconian regulations are clearly aimed at putting it under government control,"" he added. Opposition figures have used the internet to air their views, with some gaining millions of followers. Commentators opposing Vladimir Putin often face restrictions in broadcast outlets and newspapers. Analysis: Famil Ismailov, news editor, BBCRussian.com Russian bloggers are bracing themselves for the moment when Russia's new ""information security law"" comes into force on 1 August. Some already share advice on how to use proxy servers in order to access social media sites that, in their view, are under threat of being closed. It is hard to see how the law will be enforced. The servers for most of the popular social media platforms that many Russians use are based outside Russia. Many popular bloggers are already looking for, and apparently finding, ways to ""cheat"" the feature that counts page visits and keep their daily unique visitor numbers just under 3000, or to make sure that the statistics are hidden altogether. Anton Nossik, who is considered Russia's ""internet guru"", wrote in his LiveJournal blog that the new law didn't threaten individual bloggers directly, but provided legal grounds to block popular social networks like Facebook, Twitter, LiveJournal and Google. ""The issue of banning all these platforms in Russia is a political one and it will be decided by only one person"", Mr Nossik wrote, with a thinly veiled reference to President Vladimir Putin. Earlier in the year, Russia enacted a law that gave the government powers to block websites without explanation. In March, Moscow blocked the blog of Mr Navalny, along with two news sites and a organisation run by Garry Kasparov - a vocal critic of the Russian government. In a statement, Russia's prosecutor general's office said the blocks were imposed because of the sites' role in helping stage illegal protests. Earlier this week, Twitter blocked access to an anti-Kremlin account that often publishes leaked government documents, following a request by Russia's federal communications agency Roskomnadzor. For many years, Russia had relatively lax internet laws. However Moscow has recently changed its tune, with Mr Putin branding the internet an ongoing ""CIA project"". He also claimed that",1,5,4

A dissident republican group, widely referred to as the new IRA, said it carried out the attack. The organisation said Mr Ismay was targeted for training officers at Maghaberry Prison near Lisburn, County Antrim. Sue McAllister, director general of the Northern Ireland Prison Service, spent time with the Ismay family on Wednesday. She said they were ""devastated and beyond shock at what's happened"".

""We thought he would make a full recovery, we expected him to come back to work in due course, so we're all shocked, but particularly Sharon and her daughters."" Mrs McAllister condemned the behaviour of some paramilitary inmates at Maghaberry Prison, who reportedly cheered, smoked cigars and mocked wardens at the high-security jail when news of Mr Ismay's death filtered through. ""This was just unacceptable behaviour by a very small number of prisoners,"" said Mrs McAllister. ""My colleagues in Maghaberry dealt with it professionally, with great fortitude and with the courage they display on a daily basis."" She admitted she and her colleagues in the Prison Service felt ""very angry"" on hearing the reports of the celebrations in the exercise yard of the prison.

Last month, the Supreme Court ruled that the anthem must be played in every cinema before a film is screened. Some 20 people have been held in Kerala and Tamil Nadu since then for remaining seated during the anthem. Also, India's colonial-era sedition law has been often used against students, journalists, writers and social activists and those critical of the government. Reports said that the BJP's youth wing lodged a complaint against a Facebook post by Mr Chavara which allegedly insulted the anthem. The post was apparently an excerpt from one of his books. Senior police official Sateesh Bino told the NDTV news channel that the writer-activist ""is being questioned for his controversial post on the national anthem on Facebook"" and had been charged with sedition. Earlier this month, 12 people were arrested at a cinema in Kerala, after they remained seated while the national anthem played. The cinemagoers, who were attending an international film festival, were later freed but they face charges of ""failure to obey an order issued by a public servant, thereby causing obstruction or annoyance to others"".

brio,"Activity in the UK's manufacturing sector fell to a three-year low in April, according to a closely watched survey.","The Markit/CIPS manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index fell to 49.2 from 50.7 in March. A reading below 50 indicates falling output. It is the first time that activity in the sector has fallen since March 2013. Firms blamed soft domestic demand, a fall in new business from overseas and uncertainty ahead of the EU referendum. A slowdown in the oil and gas industry, a major customer for UK companies, is also hitting production. The index for new orders fell to 50.4 in April, from 51.9 the month before, matching February's three-year low. Rob Dobson, senior economist at Markit, said: ""On this evidence manufacturing production is now falling at a quarterly pace of around 1%, and will likely act as a drag on the economy again during the second quarter and putting greater pressure on the service sector to sustain GDP growth. ""The manufacturing labour market is also being impacted, with the data signalling close to 20,000 job losses over the past three months."" Last week, official figures showed UK economic growth slowed to 0.4% in the first quarter of the year from 0.6% in late 2015, propped up by the services sector. David Noble, group chief executive at the Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply (CIPS), said: ""Recent fears over a stall in the UK's manufacturing sector have now become a reality. ""An atmosphere of deep unease is building throughout the manufacturing supply chain, eating away at new orders, reducing British exports and putting more jobs at risk. ""A sense of apprehension across the sector is being caused by enduring volatility in the oil and gas industry, falling retailer confidence and the uncertainty created by the EU referendum."" The Markit/CIPS survey found new export orders contracted for the fourth straight month in April as the global economy continued to slow. A measure of employment in the manufacturing sector was also below the 50 mark for its fourth straight month. Lee Hopley, chief economist at the manufacturers' organisation, EEF, said: ""The sharp drop to a three-year low and another month of reported job cuts could be the clearest sign yet that referendum uncertainty is starting to weigh on the real economy. ""However, this is just another straw on the back of a sector already grappling with the struggling oil and gas sector, softening domestic demand and weak order outlook from other parts of the world, all of which are failing to provide any counterbalance to the political uncertainty at home.""",1,5,4

Kingsmill is among dozens of inquests dating from the early days of the Troubles that face delay because not enough money is available to investigate or there is nobody to oversee fresh hearings. Mr Leckey said: ""I feel for the bereaved families, not exclusively Kingsmill but for other inquests I am involved in. ""It is a disappointment that is widespread."" A lawyer for some of the Kingsmill victims' families said they would be pressing Stormont's justice department for more resources to allow an inquest to go ahead. Karen Armstrong, a sister of one of the murdered men, said the lack of resources was ""a political problem"". ""We are not going to lie down and accept it,"" she said. ""We will fight until we get another date and they have to make sure there are enough coroners in Northern Ireland to deal with our and many other cases.""

""Justice has been denied for almost 40 years and it is totally unacceptable that this inquest should be delayed further due to the unavailability of a coroner,"" he said. ""This was one of the most shocking and cruel events of the Troubles and the inquest must be treated with the seriousness this crime merits."" A Department of Justice spokesman said: ""Officials are actively working to ensure that all necessary resources are provided for the conduct of inquests in Northern Ireland.

brio,Arcade Fire have headlined the Pyramid Stage at Glastonbury after a lightning storm forced the festival to close early.,"Aided by dancers, confetti cannons and a man in a mirrored suit, the Canadian band revived revellers' spirits with a series of arms-aloft anthems. ""In a lifetime of pretty much impossible things that have happened to our band, this is the highlight,"" said frontman Win Butler. Earlier, every stage at the event was closed after lightning struck ground. Dance act Rudimental were escorted off the main stage mid-set, and had to abandon their planned encore - Feel The Love, with guest vocalist John Newman. ""We're quite upset,"" musician Amir Amor told the BBC, ""but we had a great time anyway"". Metallica's Lars Ulrich was flying into the site by helicopter as the storm descended. ""It was kind of frightening,"" he said. ""When we landed, all the people picking us up were going, 'we didn't expect you were going to fly in this weather'. ""But the pilot didn't say anything about that. We saw the lightning up there. I thought it was pyrotechnics for Arcade Fire."" The thunderstorm heralded a brief but torrential downpour, and the power cut took BBC coverage off the air. Music resumed on the main stage at 19:00 BST with Lily Allen, who dedicated an expletive-laden song to FIFA president Sepp Blatter. Other performers on Friday included Blondie, who proved so popular it became impossible to enter or leave The Other Stage at lunchtime, and Paolo Nutini, whose soulful ballads were a fitting soundtrack as dusk fell over Somerset. Sophie Ellis-Bextor sneaked some disco into her set at the largely-acoustic Avalon Stage, while the pulsing synthpop of Glaswegian band Chvrches made for a steamy atmosphere in the John Peel tent as fans danced off the downpour. Arcade Fire took to the stage shortly after 22:00 BST, their arrival heralded by a man dressed from head-to-toe in a mirrored suit. Bravely, considering the weather conditions, the 12-piece band were largely dressed in white, but if they were worried about laundry bills, it didn't show. They threw themselves around the stage, thrashing and spinning as though plagued by a swarm of invisible bees, each member switching instruments between - and often during - songs. As well as guitars, they played steel drums, xylophones and even a hurdy gurdy. Frontman Win Butler made frequent excursions into the audience and, during the song Flashbulb Eyes, plucked a camera from a press photographer and carried it on stage to capture the band's performance. The set list was evenly spread across their four albums, with highlights including No Cars Go, Neighborhood #1 (Tunnels) and Rebellion (Lies). The group's recurring subject matter of suburban despair and alienation might have seemed like an odd fit for Glastonbury's peace and love ethos, but there is an optimism and belief in humanity at the core of their music. Plus, they have really catchy choruses. The band's willingness to embrace all walks of life was displayed on Friday night during the song We Exist - about a teenager whose father struggles to accept his sexuality. As the opening chords rang out, a troupe of transgender and cross-dressing dancers joined the",1,3,4
brio,"As Egypt's anti-government protests continue in Cairo's Tahrir Square, the BBC has been speaking to some of the people who have been living there since the start of the sit-in to demand the removal of President Hosni Mubarak.","This revolution is the result of someone sending a Facebook invitation to many people. I got it like other people on our network. The buzz around it was then created on different social media websites and with videos. I was here on 25 January when riot police forced us out and by the 28th, we were back following the violence. I've been sleeping here most of the time since. Our social network was established in 2005, when there was a democratic opening around the time of the presidential elections. People from different backgrounds all met through blogging and hoped to use technology for social change. It meant we have all gained good contacts, experience and strong networks. I like to think the social network is the people itself. Things like Facebook, Twitter, SMS and phones are just social tools. When they blocked Facebook and shut down technology, our network still operated because it's about people. Internet activists are also people and a lot of our organising, social work and relationships are developed offline. This is something that people dreamt of but didn't anticipate happening in reality. If anything, it shows that all the effort we put in over the past few years has not been wasted. It has climaxed into this critical mass of people you see in the square. At the moment I'm not getting a lot of internet connection. I'm trying not to drain my phone battery. We're still using it to distribute footage people are bringing to us that we've sorted through. I hope the internet will continue to play a complementary role in activism. At the moment we physically exist in downtown Cairo and I hope that when we have finished this sit-in, we will have won the right to organise ourselves outside the internet. Twitter: Amr Gharbeia I was involved in this revolution from the first day, 25 January, and I've now been spending my nights here for a while. For the past five years, I was very active online, blogging and tweeting. As we live under emergency laws in Egypt it has been very difficult to meet or communicate except on the internet. I'd never been part of a demonstration on the ground. At first we were mocking the event on 25 January. We questioned whether it was really possible to have a ""Facebook revolution"". I came on the 25th because I felt it was my duty as a citizen and I couldn't believe how it turned into something so different from what we've seen before. I was walking among the people and weeping. Now I sometimes just tweet to update people about what's going on or to call for a million-man demonstration or a day to remember our martyrs. I'm well-known among bloggers for my long articles and constant tweets, but once I was here I stopped communicating this way so much. I felt it was totally different to have real freedom rather than just hypothetical freedom or internet freedom. Blogging and tweeting has been important as we were building our minds.

brio,"As the dust settles on the general election campaign in Wales, it's time to look ahead to the next 12 months.","The Conservatives have been given a huge confidence boost and will feel in a position to challenge in more constituencies next year, rather than just on the list. At the party's weekly press briefing, I asked the Welsh Conservative leader Andrew RT Davies, who was elected on the list, whether he'd stand as a constituency candidate in his home turf of the Vale of Glamorgan but he said he hadn't thought about it. Presumably those are the kind of decisions they will now feel more confident contemplating. The party will also have a huge amount of new data on voters which it'll be able to call upon and the belief that campaigning hard on the NHS helped the Tories cross the line in places like the Vale of Clwyd and Gower. The Conservatives feel it's them, rather than any of the other opposition parties, who have become the repository of votes from those who are disaffected by the state of the NHS. Welsh Labour are going to hold a ""short sharp"" analysis into what went wrong. Carwyn Jones was in line with most of the criticism of Ed Miliband when he told AMs that the party needed to appeal to small business owners who are not millionaires but who work hard. What will be more difficult is countering the argument on the NHS, which the former minister Alun Davies believes is already lost. Another potential difficulty for Welsh Labour will be dealing with unhappiness within the party over council re-organisation. Bernie Attridge, the deputy leader of Flintshire Council, has tweeted saying the party needs to be careful on local government reform if it wants to retain the support of grassroots councillors. It also seems to have been the case that Labour lost more votes to UKIP than the Conservatives, which is another challenge to overcome. But Labour will at least have the advantage that it will be David Cameron, and not Ed Miliband, carrying out the latest round of public sector cuts that are likely to take effect sooner rather than later. The question is whether Carwyn Jones is going to be able to turn that to his advantage when his own record in government will be under scrutiny. Plaid Cymru's education spokesman, Simon Thomas, also in the party's weekly press briefing, said he believed Leanne Wood could portray herself as an alternative first minister because of the way she emotionally connected with people in the campaign. The party now has a year to make that a credible proposition after it failed to gain any new seats and came fourth, behind UKIP, in the overall share of the vote, despite her unprecedented profile. He also said that on the campaign trail people wanted to know what Plaid was going to do about the NHS and that people ""did not see the strengths"" of its arguments. The Welsh Liberal Democrats are still licking their wounds but in a ""je ne regrette rien"" moment, the leader Kirsty Williams said she had no regrets over the coalition. She has admitted the party failed to communicate",1,5,3

brio,Bats are ruining an 11th Century church in North Yorkshire with their droppings and urine.,"A colony has been roosting in St Hilda's Church at Ellerburn, close to the North York Moors. But despite the church's best efforts the bats are not moving and are soiling the altar and church furniture, leaving the church with an ""appalling smell"". The creatures are protected by law and cannot be wilfully disturbed. Volunteers at the church have been working for the past decade to keep the altar, stonework and woodwork clean. But the bats, roosting in the higher areas of the church continually soil the interior of the building with urine and faeces. Church warden Liz Cowley said keeping the 11th Century building in good shape was difficult. She said: ""You can see the urine marks (on the altar), they won't go away. ""If people were coming in here damaging an ancient building like this, you would say it was criminal damage. ""The smell is appalling, it's a combination of ammonia from the urine and a musty smell from the droppings that catches at the back of the throat."" Members of the church had spent Â£10,000 trying to get the bats to move and had paid for specially-built lofts nearby. The Rev Paul Mothersdale, the Rector of St Hilda's Church, said a lot of money had been invested in trying to persuade the bats to move out of the church. The Rev Mothersdale said: ""We've tried to do everything that English Nature, or Natural England, have wanted us to do. ""Money has been spent, not only by the congregation, not only out of church funds, but local people have mucked in and helped. ""And yet we're no further forward, we're still as we were 10 years ago."" Lucy Bellini, of Natural England, said the bats had to be carefully monitored. Ms Bellini said: ""It is a really regionally important roost. ""Because of that we need to be sure that there are replacement roosts that are suitable and that the bats have found and are aware of and can move to before we allow the church to seal up access points and move the bats out of the church.""",0,5,4
brio,Bonuses are being offered to doctors in England to reduce the number of unnecessary hospital appointments.,"GP practices are being paid to help local NHS groups limit the number of patient referrals and cut costs, the doctors' magazine Pulse found. Appointments affected include scans and consultations with specialists - including those for cancer patients. The British Medical Association said such incentives were ""misguided"". At least nine clinical commissioning groups (CCGs) were offering GP practices payments for hitting targets, according to Pulse's investigation. In one case, Birmingham South Central CCG was offering practices more than Â£11,000 to reduce new outpatient attendances, follow-ups, A&E attendances and emergency admissions by 1%, compared with 2014/15. It said the schemes, which exclude cancer referrals, were designed to ""incentivise best quality practice"" and ""drive improvements in the quality of primary medical care"". ""Our priority is to ensure that patients have access to services that they need, when they need them,"" said a spokesperson for Birmingham South Central CCG. Another CCG told Pulse it had considered the ""full impact"" of the incentive scheme and was ""confident that there is no conflict of interest"". Pulse said that one scheme had already been looked at by the General Medical Council, the body which regulates medical standards in the UK, after local GP leaders expressed their concern. The magazine pointed out that initial hospital referrals for cancer patients should happen within two weeks of a GP first suspecting the condition. Dr Chand Nagpaul, chairman of the GPs committee of the doctors' trade union the British Medical Association, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that such schemes were a ""financial contaminant"" to patient-doctor trust. He said: ""It's short-sighted and misguided of CCGs to introduce such mechanisms, because they do lead to the potential for patients questioning the motives of GP referrals. ""We believe it is far more appropriate for CCGs to introduce clinical pathways that ensure patients are referred appropriately rather than these crude, salesman-like bonuses which pay GPs simply to make reduction to referrals in numerical terms."" Dr Peter Melton is local GP and clinical chief officer for North East Lincolnshire CCG, which offers the equivalent of more than Â£6,000 to practices that reduce outpatient referrals to the same level as the 25% with the lowest referral rates (which include two-week urgent cancer referrals) in 2014/15. He said the CCG was already among the best in England for referring suspected cancer patients to a consultant within two weeks and the scheme was not about avoiding sending people to hospital. ""It is not focussing on referral reduction per se but on better clinical and quality standards for the patient,"" he explained. ""The expectation is practices will be encouraged to investigate more locally and monitor the patient in the first instance rather than automatically refer in to a secondary care service."" Analysis by the BBC's Helen Briggs The NHS is under pressure to make savings, with a target of carving out Â£22bn of efficiency savings by 2020. NHS leaders want to cut patient referrals that are deemed inappropriate, particularly when patients could be cared for locally. Clinical Commissioning Groups (CCGs) are groups of GPs that work together to plan and",1,5,4
brio,Boris Johnson has become one of the most high-profile figures in the campaign for the UK to vote in the EU referendum on 23 June.,"Mr Johnson, the Mayor of London, announced on Sunday that he would be backing the campaign for Britain to leave the EU. His intervention in the debate - made, as he termed it, with ""deafening eclat"" - was even said to have helped cause the pound to slide on the international money markets as traders thought it made the possibility of a so-called Brexit more likely. He has arguably the highest profile of any of the governing Conservative Party except the Prime Minister David Cameron, but those outside the UK may be wondering: who is he, and is that actually his hair? Read on. Profile: Boris Johnson How could 'zip wire prat' become prime minister? Read more about the UK's referendum on the EU Alexander Boris de Pfeffel Johnson, to give him his full name, was born in New York and is descended from Turkish, French and German stock. He describes himself as a ""one-man melting pot"". He first made a name for himself in journalism, including a stint as Brussels correspondent for the right-wing Daily Telegraph newspaper and editor of The Spectator magazine. His humorous persona led him to become a fixture on various television programmes, including the satirical BBC panel show Have I Got News For You. He still has a lucrative and entertaining column in the Daily Telegraph, in which august forum he explained the reasons for his decision on the EU. As a politician, he has been a Conservative member of parliament for two constituencies, Henley from 2001 to 2008 and then Uxbridge and South Ruislip from 2015. Lest you think he was putting his feet up between parliamentary mandates, he is also currently serving the second of two terms as mayor of London, no mean feat in a city where the centre-left Labour Party has dominated in recent decades. That's indicative of the position Mr Johnson has carved out for himself as one of the most charismatic politicians in the UK who has wide appeal beyond Conservative heartlands - polling has suggested that his stance on the EU referendum may sway some undecided voters. Just look what happens when you type his name into Google.co.uk. Not quite. He has previously courted controversy for his remarks about (among others) the populations of Liverpool, Portsmouth and Papua New Guinea, not to mention run-ins with his own party leadership and TV chef Jamie Oliver. Last October he accidentally flattened a 10-year-old schoolboy at what was meant to be a friendly game of photo-op rugby in Japan. But none of this seems to have affected his standing among the party faithful or the public at large. Even getting stuck on a zip-wire during the London Olympics in 2012, a sure-fire route to derision for any other politician, only enhanced his eccentric image. Mr Johnson finally ended months of speculation about which side of the EU debate he would back in an immaculately impromptu media scrum outside his home in North London, having reportedly informed the prime minister of his decision earlier the same day. He said that he had come to",0,4,3

brio,Councillors in East Renfrewshire are to meet to discuss some of the projects to be considered as part of the City Deal scheme.,"They include a new water sports park, railway station and a sliproad from the M77. The City Deal scheme will see eight council areas around Glasgow receive about £1bn from the UK and Scottish governments. The councils also have the power to borrow extra cash. The Glasgow and Clyde Valley City Deal involved massive investment by both the Scottish and UK governments last year. Eight councils - Glasgow, East Renfrewshire, Renfrewshire, Inverclyde, North and South Lanarkshire and East and West Dunbartonshire - are involved. The City Deal scheme will see Westminster and Holyrood give £500m each in additional grant funding to the eight council areas. The councils will supplement this by borrowing £130m. Councillors from across all eight areas will meet to discuss some of the schemes. Several of the projects being discussed later are in East Renfrewshire, where £44m is expected to be invested over the next few years, with much of the money coming from the City Deal funding. One is a water sports park at the Dams to Darnley Country Park. It would open in 2017 and include a centre offering wakeboarding, the fastest-growing extreme sport in the world. A new railway station in Barrhead and sliproad from the M77 would serve an area which could become one of East Renfrewshire's fastest growth areas. The council expects 1,000 new homes to be built there. Another project would transform the Levern Works site in Barrhead. A site formerly occupied by Nestle, where pet food was once made, would be cleared. The site will then be marketed for development for a range of uses that will bring new jobs to Barrhead. A wide range of other infrastructure projects across the eight council areas will also be discussed.",1,5,4

brio,Eleven members of the Church of the Almighty God cult have gone on trial in China accused of beating a woman to death in a McDonald's restaurant.,"The woman, 37-year-old Wu Shuoyan, is alleged to have been killed last May simply for refusing to hand over her phone number to cult members. The murder, filmed on CCTV and on mobile phones, sparked outrage. The Church of the Almighty God cult is banned in China but claims to have millions of members. Following the brutal killing in May, Chinese authorities said that they detained hundreds of members of the cult, reports the BBC's Martin Patience in Beijing. Interviewed in prison later, one of the defendants, Zhang Lidong showed no remorse. He said: ""I beat her with all my might and stamped on her too. She was a demon. We had to destroy her."" The group had entered a small McDonalds branch in Zhaoyuan in Shandong province last May soliciting phone numbers and hoping to recruit members to their cult. Ms Wu was waiting in the restaurant with her seven-year-old son and when she refused to give her number, an act which prompted the beating while they screamed at other diners to keep away or they would face the same fate. The public face of the Church of the Almighty God is a website full of uplifting hymns and homilies. But its core belief is that God has returned to earth as a Chinese woman to wreak the apocalypse. The only person who claims direct contact with this god is a former physics teacher, Zhao Weishan, who founded the cult 25 years ago and has since fled to the United States, says BBC China Editor Carrie Gracie. No-one knows exactly where he is, but much of the website's message of outright hostility to the Chinese government is delivered in English as well as Chinese. The cult complains that religious faith has suffered from persecution by the Communist Party. Since the McDonald's murder, public outrage has forced the authorities to increase pressure on the Church of the Almighty God with almost daily arrests and raids.",0,4,3
brio,England were denied victory on the final day of the first Test against Pakistan in Sharjah.,"Pakistan seemed to be cruising to a draw before debutant Adil Rashid - who returned 0-163 in the first innings - turned the match with five wickets. Needing 99 to win, England sent out Jos Buttler and Ben Stokes in the top four. But they were eventually beaten by the fading light, finishing 25 runs short of a famous victory on 74-4. The tourists could not find the boundary frequently enough before the umpires brought the teams off, with Joe Root 33 not out. However, this was a hugely impressive performance from England and one that will fill them with confidence ahead of the second Test in Dubai, which begins on Thursday. After England concluded their innings on 598-9 in the morning, Pakistan looked assured at 113-3 shortly after tea, leading by 38 with seven second-innings wickets remaining. But the match turned when veteran batsman Younus Khan, playing in his 102nd Test match, mistimed a wild heave to give Rashid his first Test wicket - caught at point by Stokes. Rashid - whose figures in the first innings were the worst ever by a debutant - then quickly added a second victim, having Asad Shafiq caught behind for six. The door was opened for England, and Rashid and Moeen Ali barged through it as they polished off the last five wickets for 14 runs. Pakistan skipper Misbah ul-Haq - who had played with restraint for his 51 - inexplicably aimed an uncharacteristic slog at Moeen and was bowled. Moeen then removed Wahab Riaz caught behind, before Rashid claimed the final three wickets - all superbly caught at first slip by James Anderson. England sensed an unlikely victory, but their reorganised batting order could not score quickly enough as Pakistan's tactic of spin from both ends and fielders on the boundary brought them regular wickets. Makeshift opener Buttler was trapped lbw for four, Moeen and Stokes were caught on the boundary in quick succession, and Jonny Bairstow was stumped attempting a big shot. However, in truth it was mistakes earlier in the match that ultimately proved more costly as England fell just short of their first win on the subcontinent since beating India in Kolkata in 2012. In Pakistan's first innings, Ian Bell dropped Mohammad Hafeez (98) and Shafiq (107) at slip early in their innings. And Shoaib Malik, who made 245, was dismissed off a no-ball by Stuart Broad. England captain Alastair Cook, whose record-breaking 263 in the first innings was ultimately in vain, admitted England were frustrated to come so close to victory. ""We'd have liked another three or four overs at the end but that's the way it goes,"" he said. ""I can't fault the guys for hanging in there on that wicket. ""The pitch did deteriorate and spun more today which gave us hope, so it's a bit of a bittersweet finish. We knew we had to put the pressure on Pakistan and then on the last day you never know. ""We played a good game and so did Pakistan. They were a bit sloppy today and we put",0,5,4

brio,Former Premier League footballer Clarke Carlisle has been banned from driving for six months for drink-driving.,"The 35-year-old's Mercedes was stopped by police after it almost hit a lorry in north London on 20 December. Carlisle admitted failing to provide a sample to police and driving otherwise than in accordance with a licence. He was also ordered to carry out 150 hours' unpaid work at Highbury Corner Magistrates' Court. District judge Susan Williams also ordered him to pay Â£145 in costs and charges. She said that, although Carlisle had made a ""positive contribution"" to others through football, she had to sentence him for the risk his ""erratic"" driving had created. ""If you are not in control of your vehicle in a road in central London you represent a danger to people,"" she said. At a hearing in March, the court heard Carlisle's Mercedes had been spotted ""swerving"" and ""almost mounting the pavement"" in Pentonville Road. After his arrest, the court heard, he refused to give a breath sample and demanded to speak to his solicitor. Lisa Judge, defending, said he allowed the matter to ""escalate out of all control"" and ""unfortunately"" believed he had the right to see a lawyer, instead of being breathalysed. Carlisle has revealed he attempted to take his own life two days afterwards, when he was hit by a lorry on the A64 near York. Miss Judge described the arrest as having happened while he was ""in an extremely dark place in terms of his own life"". Carlisle is now so sorry about what happened that the court-ordered medical report on him ""utterly oozes remorse"", Miss Judge said. The court was told Carlisle had been involved in ""excess drinking offences"" in 1999 and 2011. He played for teams including Burnley, Queens Park Rangers, Leeds United and Northampton Town and was also the chairman of the Professional Footballers' Association.",0,5,4

John Booth, team principal of the Marussia F1 Team, said: ""Maria emerged from theatre at Addenbrooke's Hospital this morning after a lengthy operation to address the serious head and facial injuries she received in the accident at Duxford Airfield yesterday. ""We are grateful for the medical attention that Maria has been receiving and her family would like to thank the Neurological and Plastics surgical teams. ""However, it is with great sadness that I must report that, due to the injuries she sustained, Maria has lost her right eye. ""Maria's care and the wellbeing of her family remain our priority at this time. Her family are at the hospital and we are doing everything possible to support them."" De Villota sustained her injuries after her car ""suddenly accelerated"" into the back of the support lorry, according to witnesses. BBC Radio Cambridgeshire presenter Chris Mann, who saw the accident, said: ""The top of her car and her helmet seemed to take the brunt of it. ""She didn't move for about 15 minutes."" He said De Villota had been driving at up to 200mph during the testing, but the car was travelling considerably slower at the time of the crash. Mr Booth said: ""With regard to the accident, we have embarked on a very comprehensive analysis of what happened and this work continues for the moment."" Messages of support have come in from the motor racing world, including ones from Ferrari driver and fellow Spaniard Fernando Alonso and Jenson Button. Formula 1 driver and BBC analyst Jaime Alguersari said in his weekly column : ""I was shocked to hear of the accident suffered by Maria de Villota. I know her and her family very well. I still don't know the cause of the accident. There are so many rumours but I want to wait to see what really happened. ""It's terribly sad. Maria is a fantastic person, as are her brothers and her father Emilio, who was one of Spain's first F1 drivers. ""She is a role model, especially for all the females who want to get into F1. So this is a very sad situation. ""Thankfully, she is not in a life-threatening situation so we have to look at the positive side. We will see Maria again."" Lewis Hamilton tweeted: ""Just heard about Maria's terrible accident at Duxford. I hope she pulls through. My thoughts and prayers are with her family at this time.""

brio,"Funding cuts to social care services for older and disabled people are ""unsustainable"", a survey of council bosses suggests.","Councils in England are facing a £1.1bn shortfall this year, on top of ""almost unendurable"" cuts since 2010, the Association of Directors of Adult Social Services has warned. Freezing care provider fees to save money was no long sustainable, it said. Ministers say extra money will help NHS and social care services work together. The survey, which was completed by 147 directors of adult social services for councils in England, suggests that funding reductions to social care budgets have totalled £4.6bn since 2010 - a 31% overall reduction. Budgets for adult social care - which provides practical support to people due to illness, disability, old age or a low income - will reduce by a further £500m in cash terms this year, it said. ""Taking the growth in numbers of older and disabled people into account, this means that an additional £1.1bn would be needed to provide the same level of service as last year,"" the report warned. It said some councils had made savings in the past by freezing fees paid to providers, but care providers were now also facing financial problems. Some companies - particularly those in southern England - are struggling to attract staff, amid increasing concern about the quality of care, it said. ""What is at stake is the continuing capacity of adult social care to sustain services to those in greatest need,"" ADASS president Ray James said. ""In virtually all our authorities, the number in need is growing, while the complexity of their needs is increasing."" ADASS called for the government to ""protect essential care and support services to the most vulnerable members of our community"". But a government spokesman said the survey ""ignores"" a commitment to invest £10bn in health services that are being ""joined up"" with social care, by 2020. The BBC has launched an online guide to the care system for the over-65s. The ""care calculator"" covers residential care and the support provided in people's own homes, for tasks such as washing and dressing. Users can submit their postcode and find out how much each service costs where they live in the UK. There is also a dedicated BBC Cost of Care website, with news stories, analysis and video. The spokesman said: ""Increasing budgets isn't the only solution. By working innovatively and joining up health and social care we can improve care and also save money."" However, Councillor Izzi Seccombe, from the Local Government Association (LGA), said adult social care services were facing ""enormous pressures"" due to ""insufficient funding, growing demand and escalating costs"". ""We have long warned that investing in the NHS whilst social care budgets are under continual pressure is simply a false economy. ""It is social care services that support elderly and vulnerable people to maintain their independence, live in their own community and stay out of hospital longer,"" she added. Caroline Abrahams, charity director at Age UK, said the idea of a further £1bn coming out of social care budgets was ""chilling"".

Brazil's Joao Gomes Junior took silver and South African Cameron van der Burgh was third. ""I'm feeling very good. I'm so, so happy with my displays,"" Peaty said. He was speaking to the BBC after taking part in the 4x100m mixed medley relay final, in which defending champions Britain finished fifth. USA won in a world record time of three minutes 38.56 seconds. Australia took silver, with China and Canada in joint third. It was a different story in his individual race, earlier. Peaty was level with his rivals in the first few strokes before he pulled away after 30 metres. The City of Derby swimmer appeared set to break the world record for a third time in two days, but narrowly fell short. The Briton suggested ""equilibrium"" was key to his successes. ""I'm a massive believer that all areas of your life need to be equal for you to perform at your best,"" he added. ""Lifestyle, family and friendships. If one is out then you are not going to be at that level."" Media playback is not supported on this device Van der Burgh, the 2009 and 2013 world champion in the 50m breaststroke, paid tribute to Peaty's powerful performances. ""I think I have to retire and give it a few years and come back when he's older,"" joked the 29-year-old. ""It's really impressive. It's not even breaststroke anymore, he's swimming like a new kind of stroke, like a metamorphosis between [butter]fly and breast. Former British swimmer Mark Foster told BBC Sport that Peaty's display was ""immense"". ""There not enough words to describe how good he is,"" he said. ""Under 26 seconds for the second time - only four hundredths of a second off his best time. It was, again, an immense swim."" Karen Pickering, British 2001 world 4x200m freestyle gold medallist We all know how strong Peaty is. In his semi-final he was a little bit lower in the water as he set his world record. Because he's not quite as high as he is in the 100m, he has a quicker turnover. He can keep that up for 50m, but not for a 100m - that's why he went to 25.95 seconds. You couldn't do that in the 100m because of the build-up of lactic acid. But because it's Adam Peaty, he might be able to manage that in a year. Watch the full interview on BBC Radio 5 live's page Rebecca Adlington, double Olympic champion at Beijing 2008 He is the poster boy for swimming across the world, not just in Britain Adam gets the biggest cheer from the crowd for a non-Hungarian for the whole meet.

brio,"Honey, water and a bit of imagination are all needed to make a drinkable version of the Celtic elixir of love.","But what's brewing in this new crop of commercial meaderies - as they are known - is lot more refined from the drink that once decorated tables across medieval Europe. ""Do we have any mead makers or home brewers in the group?"" asks Ben Alexander, eying a crowd of a dozen or so people who have come to his Maine Meade Works, in Portland, on a rainy Friday for a tour. When no-one raises their hand, Mr Alexander launches into the full spiel. ""If you guys want to come around, I'll show you how this thing works,"" he says, gesturing to two ceiling-high columns of stainless steel filled with something resembling a mushy golden porridge. ""We mix up honey and water over there and we pump it through a hot water bath at 160 degrees [71C] in a stainless steel coil here. Each one produces about 50 to 75 gallons [227-340 litres] of mead a day,"" explains Mr Alexander. It's fair to say he is obsessed with mead. ""It's the quintessential local beverage - you can go anywhere in the world and find honey to make mead, and I think that's unique among alcoholic beverages,"" he gushes. After being introduced to the drink by a home brewer, Mr Alexander thought there were profits to be had in a commercial meadery. He founded Maine Mead Works in 2008, pouring his savings and money from friends and family into the business. His business has since grown, along with the popularity of mead in the US. It's now a seven-person operation that manufactures more than 7,500 cases a year, shipping them as far away as China. Mr Alexander is not the only one to have caught on to the commercial potential of mead. Vicky Rowe, the owner of mead information website GotMead, says interest in the product in the US has exploded in the past decade. ""We went from 30-40 meaderies making mead to somewhere in the vicinity of 250 in the last 10 years,"" she says. ""I like to say that everything old is new again - people come back to what was good once."" Even visitors to Mr Alexander's meadery agree. Tour participant Dirk Heseman admitted that while Maine Mead Works was the first meadery he'd actually visited, he has noticed that mead ""is becoming more and more available - similar to cider"". Just this year, commercial meaderies in the US have banded together to form an industry group, the American Mead Makers Association, to better share information and encourage growth in the industry. But there's a lot of work that needs to be done to improve the image of a drink long associated with Renaissance fairs and medieval re-enactments. ""I think our number one challenge as an industry is awareness of what mead is,"" says Mr Alexander. ""You ask 10 people in a room if they've ever heard of mead, and two of them might say, 'yes', and only one of them has had a very positive experience."" The mead of the past was often sweet, and didn't appeal to many drinkers",1,4,4
brio,"India's economy grew slower than expected in the three months to the end of March, adding to pressure on the government.","India's gross domestic product (GDP) grew by 5.3% in the quarter compared with a year earlier, data showed. That is down from 6.1% in the previous quarter. Analysts were expecting the same figure for January to March. India is the third-largest economy in Asia but has been struggling with inflation and currency weakness. Since July last year, the Indian rupee has seen one of the biggest declines among Asian currencies, dropping more than 27% against the US dollar. ""Shocking numbers as growth was even lower than lows witnessed during the financial crisis,"" said Anubhuti Sahay from Standard Chartered Bank in Mumbai. The BBC's Yogita Limaye in Mumbai said that just a year ago India was aspiring for double-digit growth. But a global slowdown has reduced external demand, and high inflation coupled with a weak rupee has made things more expensive within the country. Domestic demand, which India's economy is largely reliant on, has also slowed in part due to the political upheaval in the country. India's economy is suffering from ""policy incoherence, shifting global risk appetite and a comatose government"", said Rajeev Malik, senior economist at brokerage CLSA India's Prime Minister Manmohan Singh admitted early this month that his government must do more to get the once fast-growing economy moving again. The Congress-led coalition government is caught up in a slew of corruption scandals. Key policy reforms, including allowing foreign investment in India's retail sector, have been delayed in parliament for more than a year. This has worried foreign investors and threatened the country's investment grade credit rating. ""This is definitely a very important signal for the government - this is a make or break situation for India and the government has to step on the panic button,"" said Rupa Rege Nitsure, chief economist at Bank of Baroda in Mumbai.

Election officials have urged patience. Uhuru Kenyatta, who faces trial at the International Criminal Court, has been leading in early presidential results declared from Monday's tightly contested election. He is due to stand trial at The Hague next month for allegedly fuelling violence after the disputed 2007 election. He denies the charge. His closest rival is outgoing Prime Minister Raila Odinga. With provisional results in from more than 40% of polling stations earlier on Wednesday, Mr Odinga had 42% of the vote compared with Mr Kenyatta's 53%. However, Mr Odinga's allies remain confident that he will gain ground as results from his strongholds, including the Coast Province, are declared. More than 1,000 people were killed in the violence which broke out in 2007-08 after Mr Odinga claimed he had been cheated of victory by supporters of President Mwai Kibaki, who is stepping down after two terms in office. The BBC's Solomon Mugera in the capital, Nairobi, says Kenyans are becoming increasingly anxious about the delay in finalising the results. Some businesses and schools across the country have remained shut since Monday's election, he says. This has led to a shortage of goods, pushing up the prices of basic foodstuff in areas such as Kibera, the biggest slum in Nairobi and a stronghold of Mr Odinga, our correspondent adds. Uhuru Kenyatta Raila Odinga Profile: Uhuru Kenyatta Profile: Raila Odinga Some electoral officials have had to drive hundreds of kilometres to the counting centre in Nairobi to deliver paper copies of the tally of their returns. At about 13:00 local time, returning officers from only 53 of the 290 constituencies had arrived and the election commission said it would announce results from constituencies as they were ready. Its website had stopped giving updated results from the presidential race on Wednesday, and was still showing figures from Tuesday night. Our correspondent says the large number of spoiled ballots - about 6% of the total vote, well over double the number of votes cast for the third-placed candidate, Musailia Mudavadi - has become a major bone of contention. Mr Odinga's Coalition of Reforms and Democracy (Cord) wants them to be counted, but Mr Kenyatta's Jubilee Coalition is resisting this. Late on Tuesday, the election commission announced that the spoiled ballots would count in the overall vote total, increasing the likelihood of a run-off between the top two candidates, news agencies report. Mr Kenyatta's running mate William Ruto, who is also facing a trial at the ICC, said foreign embassies may have influenced such a decision. ""We want to believe that this is not an attempt to deny the Jubilee Coalition a first-round victory as is clearly now on the wall,"" he is quoted by Reuters news agency as saying.

He added: ""We have a lot of beautiful things to fight for and to qualify for the Champions League will be a huge success. But we have to be honest with ourselves. We were not good enough to compete for the Premier League [title]."" Defeat at Stamford Bridge left City just four points ahead of Arsenal and Manchester United, both of whom have a game in hand. With the FA Cup being City's only realistic chance of winning a trophy this term, it is likely to be the worst season of Guardiola's managerial career. The 46-year-old has never gone a single season without winning a trophy - he has won the title in six out of seven attempts and his sides have always reached the last four of the Champions League. Guardiola has also responded to questions about a row between City and Chelsea coaching staff at Stamford Bridge following the defeat on Wednesday night. There have been conflicting claims about the precise nature of the row, but stewards were needed to calm the situation down after Chelsea's 2-1 win. The incident centred around a disagreement between Chelsea fitness coach Paolo Bertelli and Manchester City masseur Mark Sertori, both of whom speak Italian, as the Premier League leaders celebrated their victory.

brio,"Many children in foster care in Scotland are struggling to find a stable home, according to a new report.","Research carried out by the Fostering Network suggests almost half of fostered young people are already living with their third foster family since going into care. The group has warned that 750 more foster carers are ""urgently"" needed to meet the demands of the care system. It urged people to ""open their hearts and homes"" to vulnerable youngsters. Currently, more than 5,500 children are in foster care in Scotland, living with 4,400 families and carers. The Fostering Network surveyed 250 children, teenagers and foster carers across Scotland and discovered that many young people had failed to find stability. Almost half were already living with their third family, a quarter were with their fourth family and about 20 were living with their 10th family since going into care. There was a particular need for homes to be found for vulnerable teenagers, siblings and disabled children, the study found. Carla, 23, was taken into care at the age of 12 and had eight foster homes before moving in with the Randalls. ""Looking back now I realised that the Randalls saved my life,"" she said. ""I never understood the extent of the neglect and abuse I had endured until I came to live with a 'normal' loving family. ""They were just always themselves, the smallest details meant so much to me. ""They nurtured a young, angry, untrusting teenager to become a positive, empathetic and successful young woman."" The Fostering Network said instability had a detrimental effect on the child's education and wellbeing, while finding a stable foster carer from the outset could lead to improved relationships and a happier childhood. Sara Lurie, director of the Fostering Network Scotland, said: ""As each year passes, we see more and more children coming into care. ""We need people who can open their heart, and their homes, to vulnerable children and young people and use their skills to help support them to reach their full potential. ""In particular we need people who have the skills, patience and passion to look after teenagers who may have had a really tough time and be facing some real challenges, and to offer them love, stability and security. ""A good foster carer will believe in the ambition of the children in their care in the same way they'd believe in the ambition of their biological family members."" Apologies for the delay, see below as requested. A Scottish government spokeswoman said: ""Giving young people security is paramount and we have done a great deal of work with our partners across local government and the third sector to improve how we intervene early when there is a problem within families to find appropriate solutions quickly. ""We have also expanded the age at which young people can remain in foster care as part of the continuing care provisions and the support available when they transition into independent living.""",1,5,5

College principal Chris Wilkes said the decision was related to ""low student numbers rather than any other reason"". He said it would continue to focus on adult education. Famous Ruskin College alumni include former deputy prime minister John Prescott and Dennis Skinner, MP for Bolsover in Derbyshire. BA English Studies, BA History with Social Sciences and MA Women's Studies are being discontinued. Anne Hughes, 63, from Thame in Oxfordshire, has been studying BA English Studies part-time at the college for two years. She said she was ""absolutely distraught"" it was being cut. She is physically disabled and has depression, and said she chose to study at the college because it worked with ""disadvantaged, disabled and mature students"". The college also offers bespoke timetables, unlike some other places of higher education, she added. Online petitions have been set up in a bid to save the English faculty and the Women's Studies course. One signatory, Jenny Lewis, wrote on the first petition: ""[Tutors] Helen Kidd and Tom Sherry are carrying on the great Ruskin tradition of bringing opportunities to those that otherwise would not have them."" Student and activist Saskia Ritchie, who set up the second petition, said Ruskin had been set up for ""people who would traditionally be excluded from academia"" and gives ""access to truly excellent learning opportunities"". Mr Wilkes said the college would lose about 25 students as a result of the cuts. He added degrees had been on offer at the college for about 10 years and were ""relatively new"" considering the college's 116-year history. ""Our focus will continue to be on educating adults and I think what we're doing is just renewing our offer but doing it in a different way, fulfilling our mission in a different way, to perhaps how we've done it in the past,"" Mr Wilkes added.

brio,More than two million people have signed a petition against a free trade deal between the European Union and the US.,"The petition calls on the EU and its member states to stop the talks on the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership or TTIP. It also says they should not ratify a similar deal that has already been done between the EU and Canada. It says some aspects pose a threat to democracy and the rule of law. One of the concerns mentioned in the petition is the idea of tribunals that foreign investors would be able to use in some circumstances to sue governments. There is a great deal of controversy over exactly what this system, known as Investor State Dispute Settlement, would enable companies to do, but campaigners see it as an opportunity for international business to get compensation for government policy changes that adversely affect them. This kind of provision exists in many bilateral trade and investment agreements. Friends of the Earth have published new research on the impact they have had on EU countries. Information about these cases is not always made public, but the group says that going back to 1994, foreign investors have sought compensation of almost €30bn (£24bn) from 20 states. Where the results are known (a small minority of the total), the tribunals have awarded total compensation of €3.5bn (about £2.8bn). In Britain, the possible implications of this provision for the National Health Service have been especially controversial. Campaigners believe that the investor tribunals would make it harder to reverse any decisions to contract services out to international healthcare firms. John Hilary of War on Want said: TTIP ""will make it impossible for any future government to repeal the Health & Social Care Act and bring the NHS back into public hands"". The petition lists a number of other areas where its signatories believes European standards would suffer if the TTIP negotiations are completed and the Canada deal is ratified: employment, social, environmental, privacy and consumer protection. The European Commission says the EU will not have to sacrifice its high standards. It also says investor protection provisions are important for investment flows and have in general worked well. But it accepts there is a need for improvement and is trying to achieve that in its bilateral negotiations. The petition has been organised as an exercise called a European Citizens' Initiative which can lead to a public hearing in the European Parliament and require the European Commission to give a formal response explaining why it is accepting or rejecting what the petitioners call for. The European Commission has already said that the petition doesn't qualify as such an Initiative. Campaigners have launched a legal challenge to this decision.",0,4,3
brio,"Neil Lennon's decision to take the Hibernian manager's job was not a surprise, but the fact that he has been in charge of a team in the Championship for the past two seasons was not.","His previous jobs were at Celtic and Bolton, but moving to the second tier of Scottish football was no hindrance to him returning to work at Easter Road. Lennon saw the vacancy as an opportunity, and that was enough to encourage Hibs that a figure of his profile and experience would accept a role in the Championship. Even though his last job in Scotland involved leading a team on Champions League duty, Lennon's mind has not been swayed by haughtiness. The appointment of the former Celtic manager as successor to Alan Stubbs suits both parties, because it is mutually beneficial. Success is alluring, and Hibs offer Lennon the chance to accumulate more achievements. He was immediately engaged in crisis management at his previous club Bolton, but will find stability, potential and accomplishment at Easter Road. The demand will be to deliver promotion, but that will not seem daunting when the majority of the squad that pushed Rangers for a while last season then won the Scottish Cup is still in place. Lennon's task is to refine and bolster the team, when new managers are often faced with a period of overhaul. Stubbs left the club on an emotional high after delivering their first Scottish Cup in 114 years, but before the final against Rangers there was a tangible sense of exasperation that promotion had been missed. Hibs were entitled to feel that it was an unnecessary failure given their circumstances. The club is about to embark on a third season in the Championship, but by most other measures they can be considered a top-flight outfit. The budget will be significantly more than the rest of the teams in the division, the training ground at East Mains and facilities are first-class, the football side of the business is stable and well-run by George Craig, the club's head of football operations, the squad is full of talent. Lennon can rely on consistently assured performances from the likes of David Gray, Darren McGregor, Paul Hanlon, Lewis Stevenson, John McGinn, Fraser Fyvie, Dylan McGeouch, James Keatings and Jason Cummings. Some minor issues remain, such as who will fill the goal next season, but the challenge is more on adding depth and strength of will to the squad and man-management. McGinn, one of the most reliably effective players in the Championship last season, has already insisted that he remains committed to Hibs despite the failure to achieve promotion. The 21-year-old midfielder provides the kind of industry and spirit that a team can be built around. There may be critical decisions to make, though, since Cummings is entering the final year of his contract and so represents a sellable asset. He is a regular goalscorer, though, and Stubbs had to sign Anthony Stokes on loan last January to provide some support up front. These are tweaks compared to the amount of work Stubbs had to carry out when he was appointed two years ago. Hibs are ready to be guided forward, not waiting to be rescued.

brio,Online retail giant Amazon has begun recording sales in the UK and other European countries as taxable income.,"Transactions carried out in European markets were previously recorded in Luxembourg, with which Amazon had a low-tax agreement. Now sales made through subsidiaries in the UK, Germany, Spain and Italy will be registered in those countries, the retailer has said. Amazon had received heavy criticism for its tax avoidance policies. ""More than two years ago, we began the process of establishing local country branches of Amazon EU Sarl, our primary retail operating company in Europe,"" the company said in a statement. ""As of 1 May, Amazon EU Sarl is recording retail sales made to customers through these branches in the UK, Germany, Spain and Italy. ""Previously, these retail sales were recorded in Luxembourg."" Amazon added that it was ""working on opening a branch for France"". In recent years, the European Union has intensified its investigations into the tax deals negotiated by global companies with countries such as Ireland, Luxembourg and the Netherlands. It suspects that such deals amount to illegal state aid and distort competition. Last year, the European Commission - the EU's executive arm - launched a formal investigation into Amazon's tax arrangements with Luxembourg. And the EU is also looking into tech giant Apple's tax dealings in Ireland, coffee-shop chain Starbucks' dealings in the Netherlands, and Italian carmaker Fiat's agreement with Luxembourg.",1,5,5

The union is the third largest in the UK with more than 600,000 members. Current general secretary Paul Kenny announced in the summer he was standing down after almost a decade in the job. Mr Roache has 35 years experience at the GMB and led the Leeds City Council 13-week refuse and street cleaning strike in 2009 - the longest in the union's history. He said he was ""proud and humbled"" to have been elected. ""I will repay GMB members' faith in me by leading a 21st Century union that fights for our members, their families and communities, every hour of every day."" Mr Roache also paid tribute to Mr Kenny for his work ""that has made GMB the envy of the union movement"". Details of the handover date have yet to be agreed.

brio,Plans to build flats and houses on the site of a former council housing block at the centre of a housing scandal could be approved.,"In 2008, elderly residents were moved out of Greyhound Opening in Norwich and senior city council officers moved in. The council's head of neighbourhood and strategic housing, Kristine Reeves, was later sacked over the affair. The development proposals, put forward by Norwich City Council, include 60 flats and 45 houses. The report to the council says 35 of the houses and flats will be for social rent. A report to Norwich City Council's planning committee, which meets on Thursday, advises councillors to approve the plans. Elderly residents were moved out of Greyhound Opening and nearby Goldsmith Street seven years ago after Norwich City Council agreed to redevelop the site. The council agreed that new employees relocating to the city could move in temporarily ahead of demolition. However other staff, including Ms Reeves, also moved in, in contravention of council policy. The council resisted calls for a full independent inquiry. Its own investigation found safeguards covering conflicts of interest were in place but not followed. In February 2009, London-based architects Riches Hawley Mikhail won a competition to design a new social housing development on the site, but they were never commissioned. During that year homes on the derelict site were demolished, but the site has since remained untouched.",1,4,4
brio,"Plans to create 13 new marine protected areas in Welsh waters have been scrapped, the natural resources minister has said.","Alun Davies told AMs they had received 7,000 responses to a consultation containing ""strongly held"" views. He said he would now look at the 125 existing marine protected areas to see if further improvements could be made. The Marine Conservation Society (MCS) described it as an ""embarrassing U-turn"" for the Welsh government, and has called for better protection of seas. Creating the zones would mean a ban on fishing and anchoring in some areas and had brought opposition. The Welsh Fishermen's Association said previously that existing conservation networks for Welsh waters are adequate. The Welsh government proposed the zones last year with the backing of the Countryside Council of Wales and the Marine Conservation Society. The minister for natural resources said the decision had been made after the thousands of responses to the consultation brought ""divergent and strongly held views"". Mr Davies said to ""avoid any continuing uncertainty over the options presented in the 2012 consultation, I am also withdrawing all the proposed sites"". His comments come after the findings were published of a task and finish team which reviewed the feedback. Now, he will concentrate on the existing 125 Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) that cover 36% of Welsh seas to see if any changes can be made rather than creating additional zones. ""We are now in a stronger position to assess our current contribution to the network's ecological coherence,"" he said. ""I have, therefore, commissioned an assessment of our current MPAs to identify if there are any gaps and what the options might be to fill those gaps. ""If any measures are required, I believe they should be simple, proportionate and fit for purpose."" Dr Peter Richardson, biodiversity programme manager for MCS, said the Welsh government ""spent an awful lot of time and money and encouraged other people to put effort into this consultation response"". He said: ""70% of the consultation responses were in favour of designating these sites and yet today the minister has announced he's scrapping the whole thing... bit of an embarrassing U-turn for the government I think."" He added: ""I think there are plenty of people in the fishing industry... that understand that in order to get the best yields from the marine habitats on which they depend, they have to be managed properly.""",0,4,4
brio,"Police have said a dissident republican arms find in County Antrim over the weekend was a ""significant"" and ""potentially life-saving"" find.","A ""terrorist hide"" was uncovered at Capanagh Forest near Larne after two members of the public found suspicious objects in the woods on Saturday. Some of the items found included an armour-piercing improvised rocket and two anti-personnel mines. The main line of police inquiry is the arms belonged to dissident republicans. Last week, Home Secretary Theresa May said MI5 believed an attack on targets in Great Britain by dissident republicans had become ""a strong possibility"". Analysis: Vincent Kearney, BBC News NI's home affairs correspondent The discovery of what appears to be a second dissident republican arms dump near Larne within three months has left police baffled. Based on location alone, the analysis would be that the items found most likely belonged to loyalist paramilitaries. But the nature of what was found suggests otherwise and the finger of suspicion firmly in the direction of dissident republicans. Det Supt Kevin Geddes said the threat level in Northern Ireland from dissident republican groups remains ""severe"" and an attack is ""highly likely"". Police officers found three barrels hidden in holes in the forest. As well as rockets and mines, there were also several pipe bombs, assault rifle ammunition and parts to construct a ""substantial number of explosive devices"". Det Supt Geddes said the seizure was significant ""both in terms of its size and its capability"". ""A number of these devices were ready to be deployed,"" he added. ""This seizure has undoubtedly saved lives."" He said the type of weapons that had been found meant police would focus their investigation on dissident republicans. In March, an arms find was made at Carnfunnock Country Park near Larne, and police said the were investigating a connection between the two discoveries. ""There are links in terms of the general location and the manner and method of storage and packaging of these munitions,"" Det Supt Geddes said. He added that police are ""indebted"" to the two people who noticed the suspicious objects in the Capanagh Forest.",1,5,4

The man, sporting a side parting and a trademark moustache, had been seen having his photograph taken outside the house in Braunau am Inn in which Adolf Hitler was born. The lookalike had recently moved to the town on the German border, police spokesman David Furtner told the BBC. Mr Furtner said this was not a joke or a piece of performance art. ""The young man knows exactly what he is doing,"" the police spokesman said. He said the man had also been spotted in Vienna and Graz. Pictures of the man were published by Austria's Heute.at news website on Monday. Glorifying the Nazi era is a crime in Austria. Last October, the Austrian authorities decided to demolish Hitler's birthplace house to stop it becoming a focal point for neo-Nazis. Hitler was born in a rented room on the top floor of the building on 20 April 1889. During Nazi rule, the house was transformed into a shrine to Hitler as the town drew in a wave of tourists.

""We were [rehearsing] in the tent for about a week and a half, then we had to move to bigger studios in Hollywood where we are working on the rest of the show,"" she told Houston radio station Mix 96.5. ""And then we will send that equipment to Houston where we will finish rehearsals. Fans can expect a performance that spans my career so far."" She has a high standard to live up to - notably Prince's show in 2007, which took place in the middle of a Miami thunderstorm and is widely accepted as the greatest performance in the event's history, if not Prince's career. Here are some of the other most memorable - and surprising - moments from the last 30 years. Super Bowl performers get a very strict 12-minute time limit, so most performers cram their set with as much music as possible. Not Michael Jackson. After shooting onto the stage at the Pasadena Rose Bowl, he stood completely still, staring at the world for a full 90 seconds. Ninety. It was a master class in ratcheting expectation to a fever pitch. And the screams when he launched into Jam (not one of his best songs) proved he knew what he was doing. Brilliantly, Jackson staged this entire performance while wearing a jacket it looked like he'd borrowed from Muammar Gaddafi. Beat that, Gaga. Baby, he was born to run... and slide on his knees... and crotch slam a TV camera. In his autobiography, The Boss explains the incident like this: ""Too much adrenalin, a late drop, too much speed, here I come, Mikeâ€¦ BOOM! ""And I'm onto his camera, the lens implanted into my chest with one leg off the stage. I use his camera to push myself back up andâ€¦ BLAM! BORN TO RUN!"" It led to the memorable headline: ""America Attacked by Bruce Springsteen's crotch"" - but it didn't stop the star delivering one of the most powerful and energetic Super Bowl shows in recent history. Even if they were fined for over-running by 40 seconds. Coldplay were the headline act at last year's Super Bowl in Santa Clara - but someone forgot to tell Beyonce. She only performed one song, Formation, underscoring its message of black pride and power with back-up dancers dressed in leather body suits and black berets reminiscent of the Black Panthers movement. Some of her dancers were even pictured holding up a sign declaring ""Justice 4 Mario Woods"" - a 26-year-old black man who was shot dead by armed police in San Francisco two months earlier. The performance heralded the arrival of her unapologetically political album, Lemonade, later in the year.

Political leaders, businesses, sporting organisations, and charities will meet at Lancaster House on Thursday. Mr Cameron says corruption is ""the root of so many of the world's problems"". He also described it as ""an enemy of progress"". ""It destroys jobs and holds back economic growth, traps the poorest in desperate poverty, and undermines our security by pushing people towards extremist groups,"" he added. ""The battle against corruption will not be won overnight. It will take time, courage and determination to deliver the reforms that are necessary. But we cannot hope to solve the major global challenges we face without tackling the exploitation, fraud and dishonesty at their heart. ""For too long there has been a taboo about tackling this issue head-on. The summit will change that. Together we will push the fight against corruption to the top of the international agenda where it belongs."" Among the world leaders attending the summit are presidents Ashraf Ghani of Afghanistan, Juan Manuel Santos of Colombia and Muhammadu Buhari of Nigeria, and Norwegian prime minister Erna Solberg. Russia is to be represented by deputy foreign minister Oleg Syromolotov. Panellists are expected to include World Bank president Jim Yong Kim and International Monetary Fund's managing director Christine Lagarde. Under the prime minister's plans, leaders at the summit would pledge to expose corruption and pursue and punish those who perpetrate, facilitate or are complicit in it. Campaigners have also called for a crackdown on tax havens linked to the United Kingdom. The recent Panama Papers leak showed how some wealthy people use offshore firms to evade tax and avoid sanctions. A Downing Street spokesman said: ""We are in discussions with the Overseas Territories and Crown dependencies with major financial centres about their attendance, and expect a number to join the summit."" Robert Barrington, of anti-corruption campaigners Transparency International, said: ""The prime minister is creating a platform for governments that are serious about fighting corruption to make really significant changes and set the agenda for a generation to come. ""What is key now is that other governments are persuaded to sign up to ambitious targets and that the UK government does not give in to the usual last minute attempts by less committed countries to water down the summit's ambitions"".",1,5,5

""All the children, orphaned for one reason or another, absolutely loved the hats and balloons."" Prince Harry was supporting the charity Sentebale which assists projects that work with disadvantaged children, many of whom have Aids or have become orphans because of the disease. He was also photographed participating in the building of Mamohato Children's Centre. This will give emotional and psychological support to young people affected by HIV and Aids.

brio,Ricky Burns was a man on a mission when he returned to the ring against Michele Di Rocco.,"With three defeats in his previous six bouts, the Scottish boxer's career seemed to be on the wane. But his power, timing and focus returned in a supremely confident display at Glasgow's Hydro on Saturday night as he clinched the vacant WBA World Super-Lightweight title - and entered the record books as the first Scot to win world titles at three weights. Italy's Michele Di Rocco, at 34 a year older than Burns, hadn't lost a fight since September 2007. He arrived with a record of 40 wins and a draw from 42 bouts. He left a lesser figure. The referee deemed the man from Assisi to be in no state to continue in the eighth round, the result of a welter of blows to his head and body and made all the more unbearable by the hostile acoustic energy generated by 8,000 Scottish fans. Surely, for Burns, this was time to shout about his record, the ideal moment to counter all those who had written him off and questioned the wisdom of him leaving trainer Billy Nelson two years ago to work with Tony Sim in Essex? No. Instead, the champion spoke of his disbelief at the ease of his victory, his gratitude that he was safe, of his thanks to promoter Eddie Hearn, manager Alex Morrison and coach Sim for believing in him, and of his desire to celebrate with a fast-food burger and 20 chicken nuggets. ""When I got in the ring after the fight, I said, 'You've done it! You've done it!',"" reported a beaming Hearn at the post-fight media conference. ""And you know what Ricky said? 'Can you get a picture with me and Michael Buffer [the legendary American boxing ring announcer]?'"" When he has time to reflect during a well-earned holiday, Burns will take immense satisfaction at being only the third British-born fighter, after Bob Fitzsimmons and Duke McKenzie, to be a three-weight world champion. In Scottish terms, his achievements must mean that he is in the very top tier of boxing greats, comfortably mentioned in the same breath as former world champions Benny Lynch, Walter McGowan, Jackie Paterson, Ken Buchanan and Jim Watt, for example. Burns' record stands at 40 wins from 46 bouts. Remarkably, 11 of those have been world title fights. Buchanan's exploits in the United States add lustre to his legacy, but while Burns may never have fought someone like Roberto Duran, should Hearn manage to set up a bout against Cincinnati's Adrien Broner, the four-time world champion stripped of the WBA title because he could not make the weight, then Burns could achieve little more in the sport. ""There are some big fights out there for me,"" said Burns. ""I want to fight the top names. I will fight anybody. I do super-lightweight comfortably and lightweight is still an option. I would fight Terence Crawford again if it came down to it. ""That's nearly two years I have been with Tony and things have just started clicking.

Following on, he then made 68 in Surrey's 166-3 to keep Hampshire at bay and prompt handshakes at 16:50 BST. The draw sees third-placed Hampshire claim 12 points, while Surrey take 10 points and stay sixth in Division One. Burns' epic effort saw him stay in the field for all but 10 overs of the entire match, as he defied Hampshire's bowling efforts on a flat Oval pitch. The left-hander was dropped twice in the slip cordon in his career-best 219, but was the only one to resist as Ian Holland (3-37) dismissed Tom Curran (53), Amar Virdi and Mark Footitt to force the follow-on after Surrey began the day on 410-7. Mark Stoneman (47) and Burns then put on an opening stand of 109 before Holland's medium pace had Stoneman lbw and Scott Borthwick bowled in a single over. Sean Ervine became the only man to dismiss Burns in 756 minutes of play when he missed a ball down the leg side, but Jason Roy and Dominic Sibley continued on until the conclusion. Surrey captain Rory Burns told BBC Radio London: ""I'm really pleased that we've fought that hard to get the draw and the extra five points, and obviously pretty happy with how I've played. ""We had to bat seven sessions to get us to safety and that's all I was thinking. ""There were some jitters in the nineties and I got a lifeline, which was quite nice. When I was getting close to 200, I was more thinking about the situation of getting to the follow-on mark. ""They're a good side and they played really well.

The sites now redirect to a message explaining they have been blocked ""by decision of public authorities"". In 2015, the authorities banned 11 popular pornography websites, saying many failed to protect children ""from information harmful to their health"". Analysis by Vitaliy Shevchenko, BBC Monitoring The decision was made following two separate court rulings, which said the websites ""spread pornography"". Sexually explicit content is not outlawed in Russia, but the law bans ""the illegal production, dissemination and advertisement of pornographic materials and objects"". It is not uncommon for Russia to ban websites. The government agency Roskomnadzor maintains a blacklist that now includes thousands of them. Access is usually blocked for violating the notoriously vague extremism legislation or child protection laws. Websites critical of the Kremlin have been blocked too, and at one point Wikipedia was blacklisted. Following the 2015 ban, one woman asked Roskomnadzor on Twitter whether it could recommend an alternative. The agency replied: ""You can meet someone in real life."" On Tuesday, it said its earlier tweet was ""still relevant"". However, open rights campaigners have warned that local bans can be defeated. ""Blocking porn is the fastest way to ensure widespread adoption of censorship circumvention in your country,"" said Eva Galperin, global policy analyst at the Electronic Frontier Foundation. One of the affected porn sites offered Roskomnadzor a premium subscription to its service, in exchange for lifting the ban. The government agency said it was ""not in the market"" for such an offer.

The system would appoint a named person - usually a teacher or health visitor - to ensure the wellbeing of every child. But judges at the UK's highest court ruled against the scheme in July 2016, citing concerns over information sharing. The Supreme Court judges said some proposals breached rights to privacy and a family life under the European Convention on Human Rights. However, the court said the aim of the Act, which is intended to promote and safeguard the rights and wellbeing of children and young people, was legitimate. Speaking ahead of his statement to the Scottish Parliament, Mr Swinney said the Scottish government remained ""absolutely committed"" to the Named Person service as a way to support children and their families. ""Last year the Supreme Court ruled definitively that the intention of providing a Named Person for every child to promote and safeguard their wellbeing was 'unquestionably legitimate and benign',"" he said. ""Their judgement did, however, require us to change the provisions relating to information sharing. ""Since the judgement, we have undertaken an intensive period of engagement with children, young people, parents, carers, practitioners and professionals. ""I will now update parliament on the next steps in this vital means of supporting, safeguarding and promoting the wellbeing of our children and young people."" The judges said in July that specific proposals about information-sharing were ""not within the legislative competence of the Scottish Parliament"". And they said the legislation made it ""perfectly possible"" that confidential information about a young person could be disclosed to a ""wide range of public authorities without either the child or young person or her parents being aware"". The appeal was brought by the No to Named Persons (NO2NP) coalition, which includes the Christian Institute, Care (Christian Action Research and Education), Tyme Trust and the Family Education Trust.

brio,Sport funding in Scotland is to be cut by 20% over the next three years.,"sportscotland says it has yet to decide where the cuts will fall amid concerns that elite athletes could suffer. The cuts are being blamed on reduced government spending and a drop in National Lottery ticket sales - a major contributor to sports backing. Governing bodies are bracing themselves for potential job losses. About 60% of funding is made up from Scottish Government money, with lottery sales making up the rest. In the year ending 2015, total revenue was £65.1m, which is divided up and awarded to 52 sports. By the end of next year, that figure will have fallen to £51.8m - a cut to the Scottish sporting budget of 20% in just three years. sportscotland chairman Mel Young said: ""It's heartbreaking to me because I know the effort the sport governing bodies and the community that's around it; the volunteers and the mums and dads. ""And, to have to say that we're having to cut some money back is, I believe, not the right way to go."" Former badminton player Susan Egelstaff, a double bronze medallist at the Commonwealth Games [in 2002 and 2006] and an Olympian, fears the cuts will have ""a huge impact"". ""What that means in the future is that Scotland will be constantly playing catch-up,"" she said. ""It's almost impossible to catch up if you fall too far behind the leading nations."" The Scottish Government said sport and physical activity play a ""key role"" in a healthy Scotland and that ""significant"" investment would continue in those areas. ""Having successfully delivered the Commonwealth Games [in 2014] we are now focusing on protecting or raising investment in areas intended to decrease health inequality and improve life chances, and the small reduction in the sport budget allows us to support those priorities,"" Minister for Sport Aileen Campbell said. ""There is on-going support for active lifestyles through capital investment in cycling and walking, and over the last 10 years we have invested £168m in sport infrastructure - from grassroots to the elite performance which has increased the facilities and opportunities to get people active and achieve on the world stage at both the Olympics and Commonwealth Games.""",1,5,4
brio,St Johnstone condemned Inverness Caledonian Thistle to the bottom of the Scottish Premiership.,"Steven Maclean bundled home the opener five minutes before half-time. The hosts, slacker after the break, had beleaguered striker Larnell Cole sent-off after he confronted the referee. Liam Craig sealed the win from the penalty spot with two minutes to play, before Graham Cummins finished a sumptuous stoppage-time move. And things got worse still for Caley Thistle after the match, with captain Gary Warren shown a red card in the tunnel. Saints remain five points clear of Hearts in fourth place, and closed the gap on third-placed Rangers, who play Aberdeen on Sunday, to three points. With game after game ticking past, Inverness' position looks increasingly perilous. Next weekend's trip to Motherwell, second-bottom on goal difference, is now seismic. This contest turned nightmarish for the hosts after a bright opening, but the truth is, given their predicament, Caley Thistle did not threaten St Johnstone's goal enough. Billy Mckay sent a shot over from close range. Alex Fisher nodded a diving header wide. Carl Tremarco miscued a volley. Greg Tansey did draw a save from Alan Mannus when he rasped in an effort from outside the box, but Richie Foran's side never looked likely to find the net. Their best opportunity came immediately after the Saints went ahead, when Tansey fed Cole, who seemed to panic in a terrific position and shot straight at Mannus. Cole's dismissal ended the contest when he appeared to be cautioned twice for challenging referee Stephen Finnie's decision not to award a foul. St Johnstone were merciless and could have had more. With just one win from their last 21 league games, Inverness look deep in trouble. Tommy Wright's side deserve so much credit. Saints were tactically brilliant, so strong defensively and ruthlessly capitalised on their man advantage. They took one of their few first-half chances when Michael Coulson broke down the left and sent a dangerous ball across the six-yard box. Owain Fon Williams could only parry into the danger area, Cummins' shot was blocked but Maclean followed up to force it home. They should have had another when Craig's superb curling corner flew all the way to the back post where Cummins slid in and somehow knocked it over from two yards. Craig, in his 300th appearance for the club, coolly converted a spot-kick after Cummins was tripped to seal the points. Cummins then slammed home after Miller danced around the area to tee him up, before Craig cracked the bar amid the late flurry. With a tendency to finish the season strongly, and just a three-point gap to Rangers, the Perth side look capable of something special this term. Inverness CT manager Richie Foran: ""It is a tough time of the season to be sitting bottom, and I need real men to stand up to that, but not enough of them did that today. ""It is pure luck we are still in it and it is only four points. I sound like a broken record but one win changes it - that is the truth. But I need braver players with more passion and desire.",0,3,3

The council said it would bring staff in line with the other 17,000 workers and ""reduce the risk"" of staff making claims for equal pay. Union Unison said it was ""bitterly disappointed"" with the decision. Regional officer, Helen Metcalf, said: ""This is a devastating blow for the 2,700 teaching assistants in the county, who now face being driven into poverty and relying on food banks through losing Â£200 - Â£400 per month of their salary."" She said there was ""no option"" but to lodge a formal dispute and ballot members for industrial action. Teaching assistant Tony Lowery, said: ""It is really devastating for my family because I'm the main wager. I don't mean things like going on holidays or a second car, I mean things like food on the table and clothes on our backs."" Liberal Democrat councillors voted unanimously against the plans. Councillor Owen Temple said the affected staff would ""find themselves the poorest teaching assistants in the North East"" and the council was ""very likely to face legal challenge"". The council's corporate director of resources, Don McLure, said there was a ""real risk"" that, under the present contracts, other council employees could make claims for equal pay with the teaching assistants. He said: ""I fully understand the position teaching assistants are in but they are very valued, they do a great job and support the education of our children, but we are doing this to bring them in line with the rest of our workforce."" He said two consultations with assistants and the unions had failed to find agreement but it was hoped further discussions would resolve the matter without strike action being taken.",1,5,4
brio,"The BBC's local government editor, John Sudworth, is in Leicestershire to find out how the county council is coping with cuts in central government funding.","Byron Rhodes is taking me around the modern council headquarters. It's full of light. It's busy. The building has regenerated the area around Melton Mowbray's railway station, once a muddy pot-holed piece of wasteland where those in the know parked for free. Now the council offices link the station to a park and the town centre. It was partly paid for with insurance money after a fire destroyed the old offices on the other side of town. A supermarket moved in to replace it and helped with the money too, putting the council on a firm financial footing. But that was four years ago and the crisis is a different one today. It's being experienced by all local authorities - cuts in central government funding which threaten the services they provide. Mr Rhodes is also deputy leader of Leicestershire County Council, with responsibility for finance. Leicestershire is historically the poorest funded council in the country because of a quirk of Whitehall recalculations, going back a quarter of a century since the poll tax, or community charge, was scrapped. At the moment councils get income from council tax, a share of the business rates, any income they generate themselves from services plus a grant from central government. It's the grant cut which is causing them grief. What's called the ""core funding"" is worked out by the number of homes multiplied by a set amount. And each authority has a different value set per dwelling. If we look at Surrey, which is top of the table, the amount will be £1,686 by 2019/20. Nottinghamshire is mid-table at £1,482, Derbyshire is in the lower reaches with £1,422 per dwelling and then comes Leicestershire at £1,354. ""The funding system is chaotic,"" says Byron Rhodes. ""It doesn't reflect real need. Look at Oxfordshire which is an interesting example,"" he says with a glint in his eye. Could he possibly be referring to the prime ministerial plea to the county council about cutbacks to services there? ""If we had the same funding as Oxfordshire, we'd have £50m a year extra. If we had the same as Surrey, we'd have £100m more. We'd be partying everyday if we had that kind of money."" Leicestershire have been helped with a small share of what's been called transitional funding - about £300m to help councils following pressure from Conservative MPs. Think back to the vote on Sunday trading. With a majority of only 17 in the Commons, the Conservatives lost the vote when 20 odd rebelled. Last month there would've been another rebellion, including some of our own Tory MPs in the East Midlands, if something wasn't done to improve the local government finance settlement over the next four years. The money has gone largely to shire counties. Leicestershire got £6.6m spread over two years, enough to save some services from closure. But it's a drop in the ocean for an authority with a £19m black hole in the budget every year after the latest cutbacks. Labour have protested that 83% of the councils getting transition funding are Conservative-run. Many Labour-run",0,4,2

brio,The US Supreme Court has upheld key parts of President Barack Obama's signature healthcare law.,"In a 6-3 decision, the justices said that tax subsidies that make health insurance affordable for low-income individuals can continue. The ruling preserves the law known as Obamacare, which Mr Obama considers a major part of his presidential legacy. Republicans have vowed to continue fighting the law. ""We've got more work to do, but what we're not going to do is unravel what has now been woven into the fabric of America,"" Mr Obama said. The case, known as King v Burwell, was the second major challenge the law has faced in the US's highest court. Unlike in many other western countries, the US does not have a single-payer healthcare system. Private companies, rather than the US government, provide health insurance for US citizens. The enactment of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) - one of Mr Obama's most significant and controversial domestic achievements - in 2010 mandated that every American had to purchase private insurance. It provided the subsidies to allow many to do so. In 2012, the mandate portion of the law was challenged in the court. The justices ruled to preserve it. In that decision, as in the decision on Thursday, Chief Justice John Roberts surprised observers by siding with his liberal colleagues in support of the law. ""Congress passed the Affordable Care act to improve health insurance markets, not to destroy them,"" Chief Justice John Roberts wrote in the opinion. Justice Anthony Kennedy dissented in 2012, but sided with the majority on Thursday. Had the court made the opposite decision, an estimated 8.7 million people in the US would have been at risk of losing the aid that makes healthcare affordable. The stakes could not have been higher. People's health (crucially important) and Obama's legacy (less important, but for him and those around him fairly vital) were at stake. Well a politically finely balanced Supreme Court has given an emphatic, overwhelming vote in favour of the president by 6-3. I bet ""No-drama Obama"" is high-fiving anyone and everyone in the White House - that is how big it is. Obama defies lame-duck expectations Demonstrators gathered outside the court as early on Thursday morning. Reading updates on their mobile phones, the crowd became jubilant when they learned mid-morning that the court had ruled in their favour. Some began dancing, while others chanted ""If you're covered and you know it clap your hands."" ""This is a big sigh of relief for millions across the country,"" said Ron Pollack of Families USA, a health-care advocacy organisation. ""The ACA is not just the law of the land, it will remain the law of the land"". ""Today is a good day for healthcare in America,"" said activist Benton Strong. ""I hope this is the end of the line."" Demonstrators opposing the subsidies did not have a large visible presence. Justice Antonin Scalia wrote in his dissent that the Supreme Court is setting a precedent of favouring some laws over others. ""We should start calling this law Scotuscare"" Justice Scalia wrote, referring to the court's acronym. ""Today's interpretation is not merely unnatural; it is unheard",1,5,5

brio,The decline of one of the world's rarest species of gibbon in China has been revealed in old government records.,"Today, China has between 26 and 28 Hainan gibbons left, but government records that date back to the 17th Century show that gibbons were once widespread across half of the country. The apes began to disappear from the documents about 150 years ago, corresponding with population growth. The study is published in the Proceedings of the Royal Society B. Hainan gibbons are now limited to a few isolated patches of forest in the south west of China. They live in just four social groups, one of which was only discovered a few weeks ago. Understanding this population crash has been difficult, but the old government documents have helped to reveal when and how the numbers fell. Dr Sam Turvey, from the Zoological Society of London, said: ""China is one of the few places in the world that has a very very rich, long historical record. ""Because it has had such a complex bureaucracy for so long, there has been a lot of need for reporting - not just numbers of households for tax purposes and things like that, but also in terms of the kinds of natural resources that were available in the immediate environment."" These included records of animals, including gibbons, he said. ""We looked at the pattern of disappearance of gibbons through time and how that varied from place to place and the different environmental conditions and human pressures that were also present in these places."" The archives show that gibbons were a common sight in about 20 provinces in China well into the 17th and 18th Century. However, Dr Turvey said it was ""a stark contrast to their very imperilled position today"". ""We see a really steep increase in population decline and real population collapse across China about 100-150 years ago,"" he added. ""And this correlates with demographic expansion in China towards the end of the Imperial era and through the 20th Century, and the massive increase in deforestation and human population growth through the time of the Chinese Republic and the establishment of the communist party."" The researchers said a better understanding of the animals' decline would help them to establish a conservation plan for the country's last few Hainan gibbons. Dr Turvey said: ""It is an incredible privilege to be able to see gibbons in China in the wild. ""The Hainan gibbon is such as rare species, but knowing that this species is still hanging on there gives you hope that conservation will be able to bring that population back from the brink.""

brio,"The director of the Marie Stopes abortion clinic in Belfast, Dawn Purvis, is to step down.","It is the first private clinic to offer early medical abortions to women in Northern Ireland under strict legal controls. A former leader of the Progressive Unionist Party, Ms Purvis has been director of the clinic since it was launched in 2012. Ms Purvis, who will step down on 24 April, said it was ""time to move on"". She will take on a new role on the clinic's Northern Ireland advisory board. Last November, anti-abortion protester Bernadette Smyth, who leads the Precious Life group, was convicted of harassing Ms Purvis at the Marie Stopes office in Belfast city centre. Ms Purvis told the BBC that had had no influence on her decision to step down. ""I think the clinic's well established here now, we're providing services more and more every year and I'm delighted to be remaining on the advisory board for the clinic. ""But I feel it's time to move on and I think it's time for Marie Stopes to get someone else in to manage the clinic and take it to new places,"" she said. ""At times it was difficult, particularly last year with the court case and the harassment, but I put that behind me and have concentrated on delivering services for women in Ireland both north and south. ""I think I've achieved a significant historical change in the perception of abortion in Northern Ireland from where the usual narrative was that abortion was illegal in Northern Ireland to now one where people understand that abortion is legal under certain circumstances. ""I think we've challenged the myths and stereotypes that are presented by those who are opposed to a woman's right to chose."" Genevieve Edwards, director of policy for Marie Stopes UK, said: ""We were so lucky to have Dawn and wish her every success in whatever she chooses to do.

brio,The liquidators of the collapsed department store chain BHS are expected to announce on Monday who will take over the business.,"BHS entered administration in April. Since then, efforts have been continuing to rescue it from closure and save the jobs of its 11,000 staff. Last week, a surprise late bid led by retail veteran Greg Tufnell transformed the race to acquire the retailer. His team, said to be backed by Portuguese money, is the front-runner. But if a deal cannot be struck, the business may still have to be liquidated. The remaining bidders have faded into the background. Another consortium led by Matalan tycoon John Hargreaves and Turkish retail entrepreneur Cafer Mahiroglu has reportedly run into difficulties, while other suitors have apparently failed to impress with their proposals. Some of those involved in the different bids have impressive retailing histories. But then Sir Philip Green, who controlled BHS from 2000 to 2015, also had a brilliant track record. And he ended up selling the business for Â£1. So what are the chances of saving BHS from the liquidators? And just who are the people aiming to do it? In the public eye, Greg Tufnell is easily overshadowed by his more famous brother Phil, the former England cricketer. But that could change if his bid for BHS is successful, because he hopes to become the firm's next chairman. And as far as his credentials for the job are concerned, the 54-year-old executive certainly talks the talk. He describes himself as ""a highly experienced managing director with Mothercare and Arcadia, a blend of entrepreneur, strategist and hands-on operator with significant commercial business turnaround, acquisition and fund-raising experience"". His record shows that he was buying and merchandising director at Next from 1991 to 1994. He then spent three years as managing director of menswear retailer Burton, part of the Arcadia group, followed by another three years as managing director of Mothercare. He currently appears to occupy a portfolio of different jobs, including the chairmanships of leather accessories brand Zatchels and recruitment consultancy hga Group. Earlier this month, he registered a new firm, Richess Group, at Companies House. Its other directors are Nick de Scossa, a Swiss banker, and Lisbon-based entrepreneur Jose Maria Soares Bento. Until Mr Tufnell's bid turned up, many observers had assumed that BHS would be snapped up by Matalan founder Mr Hargreaves. But it appears that the cost of a deal may have proved too high. Sources say Mr Hargreaves was asked to improve his offer and balked. Like Sir Philip Green, 71-year-old John Hargreaves also enjoys the life of the super-rich. He has an estimated fortune of Â£1bn, according to the Sunday Times Rich List. But in stark contrast to the ebullient Sir Philip, Mr Hargreaves is described by industry insiders as quiet-spoken, someone who shuns the limelight. Mr Hargreaves is no longer directly involved in the business he founded. He sold his 69% stake in Matalan in 2000, then in 2006 took it private through Missouri Bidco, a company 53.5% owned by him and his family. As a partner in Mr Hargreaves' bid, there is also Cafer Mahiroglu, the owner of Select Fashions. At 50, he is the youngest of",0,5,4
brio,"The nomination of a French ambassador to the Vatican, who is gay, has been delayed, the French government has said.","The French government proposed senior diplomat Laurent Stefanini for the post in January but the Vatican is yet to respond to approve the choice. The Vatican usually responds within six weeks to approve such a new ambassador. The nomination of Mr Stefanini was seen as a litmus test for Pope Francis, who has taken a more liberal stance on homosexuality. A French government spokesman said there had been negotiations with the Vatican over the appointment. ""France has chosen its ambassador to the Vatican. This choice was Stefanini and that remains the French proposal,"" said spokesman Stephane Le Foll. Observers say most Vatican appointments are confirmed within six weeks and that this long silence should be read as a rejection. The Vatican traditionally makes no statement if it intends to decline a nomination. Mr Stefanini served in the Holy See as a deputy ambassador in the French embassy from 2001 to 2005. He was described by the country's foreign ministry as ""one of our best diplomats"". France legalised same-sex marriage in 2013, despite opposition from the Catholic Church.

The couple spoke out in response to consultation on proposed reform of sentencing for driving offences. They believe increased sentences should be backed up by manslaughter charges. Mr Moores, 28, was killed by a Vauxhall Astra driven by Donna Hackett on the M4 near Swindon. Hackett, then aged 26, fled and was found by police asleep in a ditch. She served half of a six-year jail term after she was found guilty of causing death by careless driving while drunk. The Ministry of Justice consultation suggests offenders who cause death by careless driving while under the influence of drink or drugs could soon be handed a life sentence - an increase on the current 14-year upper limit. Source: Crown Prosecution Service But Mr and Mrs Moores, from Chandlers Ford, Hampshire, also want the offence to be upgraded to a charge of manslaughter. Mr Moores said: ""Somebody can drive drunk and kill my son. Why is that not manslaughter? ""Nothing can prepare a parent for seeing their child in the mortuary. That will stay with me every day, every day that vision comes into my mind. ""Our life is ruined."" Mrs Moores added: ""There's nothing careless about drink driving. I don't want anybody else to feel like us."" Ms Hackett, who lived in Radnor Street, Swindon, at the time of the offence, appealed against her sentence in September 2011, but was refused. A Ministry of Justice spokesperson said: ""We are determined to make sure those who kill whilst driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs face the full force of the law.

The city was rocked by riots in April when a black man died after suffering injuries in police custody. Six officers were charged over the death of the 25-year-old, Freddie Gray. Speaking at a news conference on Wednesday, Mayor Rawlings-Blake said Mr Batts had ""served this city with distinction"" since becoming police chief in October 2012. But referring to the city's high homicide rate, she said ""too many continue to die"". ""The focus has been too much on the leadership of the department and not enough on the crime fighting,"" she told reporters, adding: ""We need to get the crime surge under control."" The city has seen a sharp increase in violence since Freddie Gray's death on 19 April, with 155 homicides this year, a 48% increase over the same period last year. On Tuesday, the police department announced that an outside organisation will review its response to the civil unrest that followed Mr Gray's death. The US justice department is also conducting a civil rights review of the Baltimore force and Mr Batts has been criticised by the city's police union. Earlier on Wednesday, the union released its report into the police handling of the rioting. It said officers had complained ""that they lacked basic riot equipment, training, and, as events unfolded, direction from leadership"". The report also said ""officers repeatedly expressed concern that the passive response to the civil unrest had allowed the disorder to grow into full scale rioting"". Recent events had ""placed attention on police leadership"", Ms Rawlings-Blake said, but denied her decision was influenced by the union report. Mr Davis, who is taking over immediately as interim police chief, praised his ""friend"" Mr Batts and said he was a ""true reform commissioner"".

Wrockwardine Wood and Sutherland academies, also run by the Telford Co-operative Multi-Academy Trust, were put in special measures earlier this week. The trust has not commented. Ofsted criticised the trust's lack of support to the schools and said each was now considering an alternative sponsor. Inspectors said pupils' achievement at the Phoenix Academy had dropped since it became an academy in 2013 and their latest report rated it inadequate in all areas. A report in 2013, before it converted, rated the secondary school as ""requiring improvement"", while Lakeside was rated ""good"" in 2012 under its former name the Lord Silkin School. In the latest report, inspectors said the curriculum at Phoenix Academy was ""inadequate"", while ""weak teaching"" meant pupils were not sufficiently challenged and were often ""disengaged and disruptive"". There was particular criticism of standards in English and maths which the watchdog said were limiting pupils' achievements in other areas. Ofsted's report said governors, managers and teachers had developed a ""culture of low expectations"", while leaders had failed to act decisively to halt the decline in pupils' achievement. There was, however, some praise for the acting head teacher. Inspectors said he had introduced a number of improvement measures and some were ""beginning to have an impact"". A report on Lakeside School highlighted similar concerns, criticising teachers for not sufficiently challenging pupils and for having ""over generous"" predictions of their achievement. Inspectors said many pupils, whether high achievers or those with special educational needs, were ""not making the progress they should"" and achievements at GCSE were well below the national average. Governors were also criticised for not holding leaders to account, while the report said management had failed to effectively monitor either pupils or teachers. Inspectors, did however highlight new initiatives to improve literacy which they said were ""beginning to have a positive impact"".",1,5,4

But UKIP chairman Paul Oakden said the letter did not follow proper process. A UKIP assembly group spokesman said the letter was written by a group with a ""long-standing grudge"" against the AM. The ruling NEC body discussed the issue at a meeting on Friday, where they also decided to allow a controversial anti-Islam campaigner to run for the UKIP leadership. Mr Oakden said: ""A member of the NEC had contacted the person that is putting this forward and said to them they need to follow the proper process of completing the necessary forms and submitting them to the NEC. ""Members simply emailing the NEC saying we want you to do this is not the correct disciplinary process for the party, by any stretch of the imagination. ""A member of the NEC has gone back and given advice on what they need to do."" Shaun Owen, secretary of UKIP's Delyn branch, wrote to the NEC saying: ""For some time we have been appalled by the abrasive and discourteous manner of Ms Brown towards UKIP locally. ""Her lack of effort in pursuing the aims of the party both locally and nationally is of concern to members across the region."" Mr Owen added he believed members would stop supporting UKIP if Ms Brown remained in the role. However, a spokesman for the party's assembly group dismissed the letter as written by a ""tiny and insignificant group"". In February, Ms Brown denied an allegation she had smoked recreational drugs in a hotel room. Later that month, she said she had acted ""with propriety"" after it was revealed she had discussed how an advert for a job in her assembly office could be changed to help her brother get an interview for the post.

In response, Number 10 said there were ""many difficult challenges"" in Libya, while the White House said it deeply valued the UK's contributions. Downing Street did not comment on President Obama's remark to the PM about defence spending, reportedly made before Chancellor George Osborne said the government would fulfil a Nato pledge to spend 2% of national income on defence last year. In response to the interview, a spokesman for the US National Security Council said Mr Cameron had been ""as close a partner as the president has had"" adding that ""we deeply value the UK's contributions on our shared national security and foreign policy objectives"". BBC North America editor Jon Sopel said the unsolicited statement put out by the White House suggested Downing Street had reacted angrily to the article. ""It's like we've seen a curtain drawn back on the unspun thoughts of President Obama, complete with frustration as well, and what we've seen tonight is the White House trying to close the curtain as quickly as it can,"" he added. The toppling of the Gaddafi regime in Libya - following UN-backed air strikes designed to protect civilians - led to a power vacuum and instability, with no authority in full control. The intervention was led by the UK and France - and in his interview, Mr Obama reflects on ""what went wrong"", saying: ""There's room for criticism, because I had more faith in the Europeans, given Libya's proximity, being invested in the follow-up."" Mr Cameron, he said, became ""distracted by a range of other things"". He also criticised former French President Nicolas Sarkozy, saying he had tried to claim the spotlight. The former French president, he said, ""wanted to trumpet the flights he was taking in the air campaign, despite the fact that we had wiped out all the air defences and essentially set up the entire infrastructure"" for the intervention. President Obama said the intervention ""averted large-scale civilian casualties (and) prevented what almost surely would have been a prolonged and bloody civil conflict"". But he added: ""And despite all that, Libya is a mess."" He also criticised what he called ""free riders"" in the interview, saying European and Gulf countries were calling for action against Gaddafi, adding: ""But what has been a habit over the last several decades in these circumstances is people pushing us to act but then showing an unwillingness to put any skin in the game."" Despite efforts to support Libya's National Transitional Council, and the first elections in the country for decades, it rapidly descended into violence, with two rival governments and the formation of hundreds of militias, some allied to so-called Islamic State. In January, Mr Cameron told MPs the ""Libyan people were given the opportunity"" to build a stable democracy - and it was a matter",1,5,5
brio,"Western Sahara has welcomed Morocco's readmission to the African Union (AU), saying it will now be expected to hold a referendum on the disputed territory.","It was a ""good opportunity"" and ""a chance to work together,"" a top Western Sahara official told the BBC. Morocco controls two-thirds of Western Sahara and sees it as part of its historic territory. However some, including the UN, see Western Sahara as Africa's last colony. Africa Live: More on this and other stories Find out more about Western Sahara A referendum was promised in 1991 but never carried out due to wrangling over who was eligible to vote. Thousands of Sahrawi refugees still live in refugee camps in Algeria - some have been there for 40 years. It is not clear what happens next but Western Sahara is hopeful that a committee set up by the AU will address the issues that both sides have raised. Some AU delegates said that it would be easier to resolve the issue with Morocco inside the AU. Sidi Mohammed, a Western Sahara official, told the BBC that Morocco's return to the AU means that it would now be expected to put ""in practice decisions taken by the AU with regard to a referendum in Western Sahara"". Mr Mohammed dismissed the suggestion that Morocco would now seek to get the AU to change its position, saying that the no country could unilaterally change the AU fundamental agreement, saying it opposed colonisation. In his speech at the AU summit, King Mohammed VI of Morocco said the readmission was not meant to divide the continental body. No. Algeria has always been a big supporter of Western Sahara's Polisario Front and it had wanted Morocco to accept independence of the territory as a condition for readmission. Zimbabwe and South Africa were also supportive of this stance but they were outnumbered by those who wanted Morocco back in the fold. There is no specific provision in the AU charter that bars any country from joining it. Morocco simply applied and the request was accepted by more than two-thirds of the 53 members. Morocco has been involved in intense lobbying and applied in July last year to rejoin the continental body. King Mohammed toured various African countries seeking support for the bid. No. While culturally the country's identity aligns with Arab states, its economic interests increasingly lie in Africa. This is a strategic move to continue exploring its interests in mining, construction, medical, insurance and banking sectors on the continent.

brio,World War Two medals have been stolen in a raid on a house in the Highlands.,"Police Scotland said two men broke into the farm house near to Corsock, Castle Douglas, between 23:30 on Thursday and 01:00 on Friday. They stole items including a number of war medals, gold watches and antiques. Officers have appealed for information and said the robbers may have been ""casing"" the property before the raid. Det Sgt Graeme Robertson said: ""I believe that whoever broke into this house knew what they were looking for - that is the medals, watches and antiques. ""Thankfully the householder, a woman, who was in the house at the time, was not injured but she is very upset by what has happened."" The men were described as being well spoken, with Scottish accents, of average height and build and wearing dark clothing. One of the men was wearing a balaclava and gloves. ""Due to the rural location of the house and the items taken, we believe that the two men would have had to have the use of a car. ""It is also entirely possible that they may have been in the area before the break in 'casing' the house so I would ask anyone who may have witnessed any suspicious behaviour around the area during this time, or anyone who may have been offered these items for sale, to contact police.""",0,5,3
brio,exploratory drilling for oil and gas on Anglesey has been granted a permit by Natural Resources Wales.,"Plans were approved for Coastal Oil and Gas Limited to drill in a field at St Nicholas. The permit does not allow the company to carry out fracking - hydraulic fracturing of the land - to extract any oil or gas. Fracking is subject to a temporary ban in Wales until decision-making powers on the practice are devolved. Natural Resources Wales said it had carried out a ""thorough assessment"" of the company's plans before approving them, with all work including reinstatement of the land to be completed within 12 months. ""It's important that any activity of this kind doesn't harm the environment, and this permit makes it clear what Coastal Oil and Gas Limited will need to do to comply with this,"" a spokesman said. ""Once the work begins, our officers will regulate and monitor the site to ensure it complies with the conditions of the permit, to protect people and the environment."" The permit for exploratory drilling comes despite a moratorium on fracking in Wales pending devolution of responsibility for such decisions. In August, the UK government urged councils in England to speed up the process of approval for fracking projects. However, Natural Resources Minister Carl Sargeant said fracking technology was ""unproven"", and that Welsh Labour ministers preferred to look at renewable energy.",1,5,4

cohere_xlarge-20220609,A Chinese woman has sued a hospital for 1.7 million yuan after she claimed her husband divorced her because he disliked the shape of her face.,"Though the unverified story was short on details, and did not have the husband's side of the story, ""divorced because of fat face"" quickly became a top trend on microblogging network Weibo. State media picked up the story on Thursday, which was first reported in a local evening paper earlier this week. Liaoshen Wanbao reported the 49-year-old woman in Shenyang city had claimed her husband had divorced her 10 years ago because he disliked the shape of her face, said to be ""large and square"" with ""fat cheeks"". She said it spurred her to undergo facial surgery three times at a local hospital to shave her jawbones and reshape her face into a slimmer shape. During the third surgery the doctors discovered that if they proceeded further her nerves may be damaged, and halted the procedure. The woman, identified only by her surname Wang, later sued the hospital for 1.7 million yuan ($260,900; Â£183,900) in damages. She alleged the surgery had left her with soreness in her chin, and she could only eat and drink through a straw as ""when she exerted force on her lower jaw, she had the sensation that it would break"". The hospital, however, argued that the surgeries were conducted according to regulations, and pointed out that they encouraged her to seek psychiatric help instead of a third operation, which she refused. After mediation the woman agreed to accept 20,000 yuan ($3,100, Â£2,200) as compensation, said the report. On Weibo, some condemned the woman's husband, but others also chastised the woman. One top-voted comment read: ""It's purely an excuse, if her face was large then why did he decide to marry her in the first place? If he stopped loving her then he should have just said so."" It continued: ""This woman is also very silly to have believed that her face shape was the real reason for the divorce, she is lying to herself."" Said another Weibo user: ""Even if you had gone for facial surgery and made your face smaller, he would still have found other reasons to divorce you."" One person noted the sharp difference in the compensation amount and voiced suspicions: ""1.7 million was dropped to 20,000, it makes me wonder if she really did have a problem with her jaw."" Still others took the opportunity to crack jokes. ""What an odd reason for divorce! I wonder how square was this woman's square-shaped face? Like a television set? Microwave oven?"" Plastic surgery has long been a hot topic on Weibo. In December, users similarly expressed outrage when a Chinese man took out a newspaper advertisement pleading for his wife to go for plastic surgery. More than seven million cosmetic surgeries were performed in China in 2014. The industry's value, pegged at around 400bn yuan, is expected to double by 2019, according to the China Association of Plastics and Aesthetics.",1,5,4
cohere_xlarge-20220609,A Chinese woman was beaten to death by a cult for refusing to give her phone number to them.,"The woman, 37-year-old Wu Shuoyan, is alleged to have been killed last May simply for refusing to hand over her phone number to cult members. The murder, filmed on CCTV and on mobile phones, sparked outrage. The Church of the Almighty God cult is banned in China but claims to have millions of members. Following the brutal killing in May, Chinese authorities said that they detained hundreds of members of the cult, reports the BBC's Martin Patience in Beijing. Interviewed in prison later, one of the defendants, Zhang Lidong showed no remorse. He said: ""I beat her with all my might and stamped on her too. She was a demon. We had to destroy her."" The group had entered a small McDonalds branch in Zhaoyuan in Shandong province last May soliciting phone numbers and hoping to recruit members to their cult. Ms Wu was waiting in the restaurant with her seven-year-old son and when she refused to give her number, an act which prompted the beating while they screamed at other diners to keep away or they would face the same fate. The public face of the Church of the Almighty God is a website full of uplifting hymns and homilies. But its core belief is that God has returned to earth as a Chinese woman to wreak the apocalypse. The only person who claims direct contact with this god is a former physics teacher, Zhao Weishan, who founded the cult 25 years ago and has since fled to the United States, says BBC China Editor Carrie Gracie. No-one knows exactly where he is, but much of the website's message of outright hostility to the Chinese government is delivered in English as well as Chinese. The cult complains that religious faith has suffered from persecution by the Communist Party. Since the McDonald's murder, public outrage has forced the authorities to increase pressure on the Church of the Almighty God with almost daily arrests and raids.",1,5,5
cohere_xlarge-20220609,A Hindu nationalist party in India has accused a writer of sedition for criticising the national anthem.,"Kamal C Chavara was detained by the police in Kerala state on Sunday after the youth wing of the Hindu nationalist BJP lodged a complaint against him. Last month, the Supreme Court ruled that the anthem must be played in every cinema before a film is screened. Some 20 people have been held in Kerala and Tamil Nadu since then for remaining seated during the anthem. Also, India's colonial-era sedition law has been often used against students, journalists, writers and social activists and those critical of the government. Reports said that the BJP's youth wing lodged a complaint against a Facebook post by Mr Chavara which allegedly insulted the anthem. The post was apparently an excerpt from one of his books. Senior police official Sateesh Bino told the NDTV news channel that the writer-activist ""is being questioned for his controversial post on the national anthem on Facebook"" and had been charged with sedition. Earlier this month, 12 people were arrested at a cinema in Kerala, after they remained seated while the national anthem played. The cinemagoers, who were attending an international film festival, were later freed but they face charges of ""failure to obey an order issued by a public servant, thereby causing obstruction or annoyance to others"". And at a cinema in Chennai, eight people who did not stand for the anthem were assaulted and abused, police said. The eight were later charged with showing disrespect to the anthem.",1,5,4

Oldknow Academy was one of several schools investigated amid claims of a Muslim hardliners' plot to control them; known as the Trojan Horse affair. More on this and other stories from Birmingham and the Black Country Mr Khan had been accused of agreeing ""to the inclusion of an undue amount of religious influence in the education of pupils"" at Oldknow, on or before 31 July 2014. The accusations had included telling some male pupils to change for PE in a cupboard so they would not show their thighs, banning children singing during a production of The Wizard of Oz and turning his back on a woman as she offered to shake his hand. He was also accused of sharing his personal beliefs with the children, for example telling the children they were not allowed pet dogs as they were Muslim.

Stage and TV actor Lord Rix, who specialised in post-war ""Whitehall farce"" comedies, is receiving 24-hour care in a retirement home. ""My position has changed. As a dying man, who has been dying now for several weeks, I am only too conscious that the laws of this country make it impossible for people like me to be helped on their way, even though the family is supportive of this position and everything that needs to be done has been dealt with. ""Unhappily, my body seems to be constructed in such a way that it keeps me alive in great discomfort when all I want is to be allowed to slip into a sleep, peacefully, legally and without any threat to the medical or nursing profession.

""Only with a legal euthanasia Bill on the statute books will the many people who find themselves in the same situation as me be able to slip away peacefully in their sleep instead of dreading the night.""

The police said that a post-mortem examination showed he died as a ""direct result of the injuries"" of the bomb. A dissident republican group, widely referred to as the new IRA, said it carried out the attack. The organisation said Mr Ismay was targeted for training officers at Maghaberry Prison near Lisburn, County Antrim.

He admitted culpable homicide on the basis of diminished responsibility after saying he had no recollection of the killing at Dixon Avenue, Glasgow, on 24 September last year. Buksh will be sentenced on 27 June. The High Court in Glasgow heard that 43-year-old Mrs Buksh died after being struck on the head at least five times. Pathologists told the court that the lack of defensive injuries and the position of her body suggested she was assaulted as she slept. Following the attack, Buksh went to Cathcart Police Station and told an officer: ""I've come to hand myself in. I think my wife's dead. I hit her on the head. I did it."" The court was told that three psychiatrists described Buksh as suffering from an acute stress disorder at the time. Prosecutor Gordon Lamont said: ""The accused and his wife had been married for 25 years, but over the last 10 or 11 years their relationship appears to have broken down and they became increasingly estranged, albeit, still residing under the one roof. ""They slept separately and Mrs Buksh routinely slept on the sofa in the living room. Their children report that they barely spoke to each other."" Mr Lamont said the problems in the marriage intensified after Mrs Buksh went to Pakistan on holiday in May last year. He said she had become involved with another man and was making plans to move to Pakistan.

The man, sporting a side parting and a trademark moustache, had been seen having his photograph taken outside the house in Braunau am Inn in which Adolf Hitler was born. The lookalike had recently moved to the town on the German border, police spokesman David Furtner told the BBC. Mr Furtner said this was not a joke or a piece of performance art. ""The young man knows exactly what he is doing,"" the police spokesman said. He said the man had also been spotted in Vienna and Graz. Pictures of the man were published by Austria's Heute.at news website on Monday. Glorifying the Nazi era is a crime in Austria. Last October, the Austrian authorities decided to demolish Hitler's birthplace house to stop it becoming a focal point for neo-Nazis. Hitler was born in a rented room on the top floor of the building on 20 April 1889. During Nazi rule, the house was transformed into a shrine to Hitler as the town drew in a wave of tourists.

Karen Pickering, British 2001 world 4x200m freestyle gold medallist We all know how strong Peaty is. In his semi-final he was a little bit lower in the water as he set his world record. Because he's not quite as high as he is in the 100m, he has a quicker turnover. He can keep that up for 50m, but not for a 100m - that's why he went to 25.95 seconds.

Sophie Ellis-Bextor sneaked some disco into her set at the largely-acoustic Avalon Stage, while the pulsing synthpop of Glaswegian band Chvrches made for a steamy atmosphere in the John Peel tent as fans danced off the downpour. Arcade Fire took to the stage shortly after 22:00 BST, their arrival heralded by a man dressed from head-to-toe in a mirrored suit. Bravely, considering the weather conditions, the 12-piece band were largely dressed in white, but if they were worried about laundry bills, it didn't show. They threw themselves around the stage, thrashing and spinning as though plagued by a swarm of invisible bees, each member switching instruments between - and often during - songs. As well as guitars, they played steel drums, xylophones and even a hurdy gurdy.

cohere_xlarge-20220609,"Archaeologists have discovered a ""snug"" used by Stone Age people at Blick Mead, near Stonehenge.","The shelter - in a hollow left behind by a fallen tree - at Blick Mead was used over a 90-year period from 4336 BC, it is believed. Archaeologist David Jacques, said: ""They... used the stump of the tree, about three metres high, as a wall."" The finds are being shown to United Nations heritage experts, who are currently visiting Stonehenge. Archaeologists are concerned a planned 2.9km tunnel being considered for the nearby A303 main road will damage the site. Discoveries have also shown stones were warmed up by the Mesolithic Period inhabitants and used in a hearth to emit heat in the earthy snug. Mr Jacques, a senior research fellow at the University of Buckingham, has worked at Blick Mead for over a decade, making a number of discoveries about the inhabitants. The tree stump created a wall height similar to a ""modern bungalow"". ""They've draped probably animal skins or thatch around the basin and connected it to a post so it's a very comfortable snug little place,"" he said. The wooden wall of the hollow was lined with flints and the large earthy pit created by the tree root lined with cobbles and decorated with ""exotic"" stones from outside the area. ""There are some clever and sophisticated things going on, the hot stones that they put into this little type of alcove wouldn't have been on fire,"" explained Mr Jacques. ""It looks more like these people have been using these hot stones as a type of storage heater so that you've got a lot of warmth coming off them."" Mr Jacques will meet the UN experts later to ask for the route to be moved closer to Salisbury and for hydrological assessments to be made. ""It's very likely the water flow would be reduced in and around the site,"" he said. ""It would take out all the organics and destroy all the animal bone we've been finding which is crucial for finding where they have been living and for getting radiocarbon dates from all the organics like pollen and wood. ""This is massively important for reconstructing what the landscape would have looked like."" Andy Rhind-Tutt, former mayor and chairman of Amesbury Museum and Heritage Trust said: ""I sincerely hope the team delivering the long-awaited A303 improvement look seriously at an alternative alignment south of Salisbury and away from this unequalled archaeological landscape. ""It would be criminal to destroy such a rich heritage and connection with our ancestors for the sake of blocking the view to the passing public of Stonehenge.""",1,5,4

But he also raised concerns about possible damage to the site over plans to build a road tunnel past Stonehenge. The Department of Transport said it would ""consult before any building"". The Blick Mead site is about 1.5 miles (2.4km) from Stonehenge and archaeologists said ""scientifically tested charcoal"" dug up from the site had ""revealed that it dated from around 4000 BC"". David Jacques said the dig had also found ""evidence of feasting"" including burnt flints, tools and remains of giant cattle, known as aurochs, which were eaten by early hunter gatherers. Mr Jacques said: ""British pre-history may have to be rewritten. This is the latest dated Mesolithic encampment ever found in the UK. ""Blick Mead site connects the early hunter gatherer groups returning to Britain after the Ice Age to the Stonehenge area, all the way through to the Neolithic in the late 5th Millennium BC. ""But our only chance to find out about the earliest chapter of Britain's history could be wrecked if the tunnel goes ahead."" Andy Rhind-Tutt, a former mayor and current chairman of Amesbury Museum, which part-funded the dig, said the discovery could ""provide what archaeologists have been searching for centuries - the answer to the story of the pre-history of Stonehenge.""

The city was rocked by riots in April when a black man died after suffering injuries in police custody. Six officers were charged over the death of the 25-year-old, Freddie Gray. Speaking at a news conference on Wednesday, Mayor Rawlings-Blake said Mr Batts had ""served this city with distinction"" since becoming police chief in October 2012. But referring to the city's high homicide rate, she said ""too many continue to die"". ""The focus has been too much on the leadership of the department and not enough on the crime fighting,"" she told reporters, adding: ""We need to get the crime surge under control."" The city has seen a sharp increase in violence since Freddie Gray's death on 19 April, with 155 homicides this year, a 48% increase over the same period last year. On Tuesday, the police department announced that an outside organisation will review its response to the civil unrest that followed Mr Gray's death. The US justice department is also conducting a civil rights review of the Baltimore force and Mr Batts has been criticised by the city's police union. Earlier on Wednesday, the union released its report into the police handling of the rioting. It said officers had complained ""that they lacked basic riot equipment, training, and, as events unfolded, direction from leadership"". The report also said ""officers repeatedly expressed concern that the passive response to the civil unrest had allowed the disorder to grow into full scale rioting"". Recent events had ""placed attention on police leadership"", Ms Rawlings-Blake said, but denied her decision was influenced by the union report. Mr Davis, who is taking over immediately as interim police chief, praised his ""friend"" Mr Batts and said he was a ""true reform commissioner"". Mayor Rawlings-Blake said Mr Davis would ""bring accountability to police, hold officers who act out of line accountable for their actions"".",1,5,4

But despite the church's best efforts the bats are not moving and are soiling the altar and church furniture, leaving the church with an ""appalling smell"". The creatures are protected by law and cannot be wilfully disturbed. Volunteers at the church have been working for the past decade to keep the altar, stonework and woodwork clean. But the bats, roosting in the higher areas of the church continually soil the interior of the building with urine and faeces. Church warden Liz Cowley said keeping the 11th Century building in good shape was difficult. She said: ""You can see the urine marks (on the altar), they won't go away. ""If people were coming in here damaging an ancient building like this, you would say it was criminal damage. ""The smell is appalling, it's a combination of ammonia from the urine and a musty smell from the droppings that catches at the back of the throat."" Members of the church had spent Â£10,000 trying to get the bats to move and had paid for specially-built lofts nearby. The Rev Paul Mothersdale, the Rector of St Hilda's Church, said a lot of money had been invested in trying to persuade the bats to move out of the church. The Rev Mothersdale said: ""We've tried to do everything that English Nature, or Natural England, have wanted us to do. ""Money has been spent, not only by the congregation, not only out of church funds, but local people have mucked in and helped.

Read on. Profile: Boris Johnson How could 'zip wire prat' become prime minister? Read more about the UK's referendum on the EU Alexander Boris de Pfeffel Johnson, to give him his full name, was born in New York and is descended from Turkish, French and German stock. He describes himself as a ""one-man melting pot"". He first made a name for himself in journalism, including a stint as Brussels correspondent for the right-wing Daily Telegraph newspaper and editor of The Spectator magazine. His humorous persona led him to become a fixture on various television programmes, including the satirical BBC panel show Have I Got News For You. He still has a lucrative and entertaining column in the Daily Telegraph, in which august forum he explained the reasons for his decision on the EU. As a politician, he has been a Conservative member of parliament for two constituencies, Henley from 2001 to 2008 and then Uxbridge and South Ruislip from 2015. Lest you think he was putting his feet up between parliamentary mandates, he is also currently serving the second of two terms as mayor of London, no mean feat in a city where the centre-left Labour Party has dominated in recent decades. That's indicative of the position Mr Johnson has carved out for himself as one of the most charismatic politicians in the UK who has wide appeal beyond Conservative heartlands - polling has suggested that his stance on the EU referendum may sway some undecided voters. Just look what happens when you type his name into Google.co.uk. Not quite.

Last October he accidentally flattened a 10-year-old schoolboy at what was meant to be a friendly game of photo-op rugby in Japan. But none of this seems to have affected his standing among the party faithful or the public at large. Even getting stuck on a zip-wire during the London Olympics in 2012, a sure-fire route to derision for any other politician, only enhanced his eccentric image.

cohere_xlarge-20220609,Campaigners have launched a legal challenge to the European Commission's decision not to accept a petition calling for the TTIP negotiations to be stopped.,"The petition calls on the EU and its member states to stop the talks on the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership or TTIP. It also says they should not ratify a similar deal that has already been done between the EU and Canada. It says some aspects pose a threat to democracy and the rule of law. One of the concerns mentioned in the petition is the idea of tribunals that foreign investors would be able to use in some circumstances to sue governments. There is a great deal of controversy over exactly what this system, known as Investor State Dispute Settlement, would enable companies to do, but campaigners see it as an opportunity for international business to get compensation for government policy changes that adversely affect them. This kind of provision exists in many bilateral trade and investment agreements. Friends of the Earth have published new research on the impact they have had on EU countries. Information about these cases is not always made public, but the group says that going back to 1994, foreign investors have sought compensation of almost €30bn (£24bn) from 20 states. Where the results are known (a small minority of the total), the tribunals have awarded total compensation of €3.5bn (about £2.8bn). In Britain, the possible implications of this provision for the National Health Service have been especially controversial. Campaigners believe that the investor tribunals would make it harder to reverse any decisions to contract services out to international healthcare firms. John Hilary of War on Want said: TTIP ""will make it impossible for any future government to repeal the Health & Social Care Act and bring the NHS back into public hands"". The petition lists a number of other areas where its signatories believes European standards would suffer if the TTIP negotiations are completed and the Canada deal is ratified: employment, social, environmental, privacy and consumer protection. The European Commission says the EU will not have to sacrifice its high standards. It also says investor protection provisions are important for investment flows and have in general worked well. But it accepts there is a need for improvement and is trying to achieve that in its bilateral negotiations. The petition has been organised as an exercise called a European Citizens' Initiative which can lead to a public hearing in the European Parliament and require the European Commission to give a formal response explaining why it is accepting or rejecting what the petitioners call for. The European Commission has already said that the petition doesn't qualify as such an Initiative. Campaigners have launched a legal challenge to this decision.",1,4,4

Budgets for adult social care - which provides practical support to people due to illness, disability, old age or a low income - will reduce by a further £500m in cash terms this year, it said.

The ""care calculator"" covers residential care and the support provided in people's own homes, for tasks such as washing and dressing. Users can submit their postcode and find out how much each service costs where they live in the UK. There is also a dedicated BBC Cost of Care website, with news stories, analysis and video. The spokesman said: ""Increasing budgets isn't the only solution. By working innovatively and joining up health and social care we can improve care and also save money."" However, Councillor Izzi Seccombe, from the Local Government Association (LGA), said adult social care services were facing ""enormous pressures"" due to ""insufficient funding, growing demand and escalating costs"". ""We have long warned that investing in the NHS whilst social care budgets are under continual pressure is simply a false economy. ""It is social care services that support elderly and vulnerable people to maintain their independence, live in their own community and stay out of hospital longer,"" she added. Caroline Abrahams, charity director at Age UK, said the idea of a further £1bn coming out of social care budgets was ""chilling"".

He also described it as ""an enemy of progress"". ""It destroys jobs and holds back economic growth, traps the poorest in desperate poverty, and undermines our security by pushing people towards extremist groups,"" he added. ""The battle against corruption will not be won overnight. It will take time, courage and determination to deliver the reforms that are necessary.

Together we will push the fight against corruption to the top of the international agenda where it belongs."" Among the world leaders attending the summit are presidents Ashraf Ghani of Afghanistan, Juan Manuel Santos of Colombia and Muhammadu Buhari of Nigeria, and Norwegian prime minister Erna Solberg. Russia is to be represented by deputy foreign minister Oleg Syromolotov. Panellists are expected to include World Bank president Jim Yong Kim and International Monetary Fund's managing director Christine Lagarde. Under the prime minister's plans, leaders at the summit would pledge to expose corruption and pursue and punish those who perpetrate, facilitate or are complicit in it.

cohere_xlarge-20220609,Egyptian blogger Amr Gharbeia says the revolution was the result of someone sending a Facebook invitation to many people.,"This revolution is the result of someone sending a Facebook invitation to many people. I got it like other people on our network. The buzz around it was then created on different social media websites and with videos. I was here on 25 January when riot police forced us out and by the 28th, we were back following the violence. I've been sleeping here most of the time since. Our social network was established in 2005, when there was a democratic opening around the time of the presidential elections. People from different backgrounds all met through blogging and hoped to use technology for social change. It meant we have all gained good contacts, experience and strong networks. I like to think the social network is the people itself. Things like Facebook, Twitter, SMS and phones are just social tools. When they blocked Facebook and shut down technology, our network still operated because it's about people. Internet activists are also people and a lot of our organising, social work and relationships are developed offline. This is something that people dreamt of but didn't anticipate happening in reality. If anything, it shows that all the effort we put in over the past few years has not been wasted. It has climaxed into this critical mass of people you see in the square. At the moment I'm not getting a lot of internet connection. I'm trying not to drain my phone battery. We're still using it to distribute footage people are bringing to us that we've sorted through. I hope the internet will continue to play a complementary role in activism. At the moment we physically exist in downtown Cairo and I hope that when we have finished this sit-in, we will have won the right to organise ourselves outside the internet. Twitter: Amr Gharbeia I was involved in this revolution from the first day, 25 January, and I've now been spending my nights here for a while. For the past five years, I was very active online, blogging and tweeting. As we live under emergency laws in Egypt it has been very difficult to meet or communicate except on the internet. I'd never been part of a demonstration on the ground. At first we were mocking the event on 25 January. We questioned whether it was really possible to have a ""Facebook revolution"". I came on the 25th because I felt it was my duty as a citizen and I couldn't believe how it turned into something so different from what we've seen before. I was walking among the people and weeping. Now I sometimes just tweet to update people about what's going on or to call for a million-man demonstration or a day to remember our martyrs. I'm well-known among bloggers for my long articles and constant tweets, but once I was here I stopped communicating this way so much. I felt it was totally different to have real freedom rather than just hypothetical freedom or internet freedom. Blogging and tweeting has been important as we were building our minds.

cohere_xlarge-20220609,England came within 25 runs of beating Pakistan in the first Test in Sharjah.,"Pakistan seemed to be cruising to a draw before debutant Adil Rashid - who returned 0-163 in the first innings - turned the match with five wickets. Needing 99 to win, England sent out Jos Buttler and Ben Stokes in the top four. But they were eventually beaten by the fading light, finishing 25 runs short of a famous victory on 74-4. The tourists could not find the boundary frequently enough before the umpires brought the teams off, with Joe Root 33 not out. However, this was a hugely impressive performance from England and one that will fill them with confidence ahead of the second Test in Dubai, which begins on Thursday. After England concluded their innings on 598-9 in the morning, Pakistan looked assured at 113-3 shortly after tea, leading by 38 with seven second-innings wickets remaining. But the match turned when veteran batsman Younus Khan, playing in his 102nd Test match, mistimed a wild heave to give Rashid his first Test wicket - caught at point by Stokes. Rashid - whose figures in the first innings were the worst ever by a debutant - then quickly added a second victim, having Asad Shafiq caught behind for six. The door was opened for England, and Rashid and Moeen Ali barged through it as they polished off the last five wickets for 14 runs. Pakistan skipper Misbah ul-Haq - who had played with restraint for his 51 - inexplicably aimed an uncharacteristic slog at Moeen and was bowled. Moeen then removed Wahab Riaz caught behind, before Rashid claimed the final three wickets - all superbly caught at first slip by James Anderson. England sensed an unlikely victory, but their reorganised batting order could not score quickly enough as Pakistan's tactic of spin from both ends and fielders on the boundary brought them regular wickets. Makeshift opener Buttler was trapped lbw for four, Moeen and Stokes were caught on the boundary in quick succession, and Jonny Bairstow was stumped attempting a big shot. However, in truth it was mistakes earlier in the match that ultimately proved more costly as England fell just short of their first win on the subcontinent since beating India in Kolkata in 2012. In Pakistan's first innings, Ian Bell dropped Mohammad Hafeez (98) and Shafiq (107) at slip early in their innings. And Shoaib Malik, who made 245, was dismissed off a no-ball by Stuart Broad. England captain Alastair Cook, whose record-breaking 263 in the first innings was ultimately in vain, admitted England were frustrated to come so close to victory. ""We'd have liked another three or four overs at the end but that's the way it goes,"" he said. ""I can't fault the guys for hanging in there on that wicket. ""The pitch did deteriorate and spun more today which gave us hope, so it's a bit of a bittersweet finish. We knew we had to put the pressure on Pakistan and then on the last day you never know.

Carlisle admitted failing to provide a sample to police and driving otherwise than in accordance with a licence. He was also ordered to carry out 150 hours' unpaid work at Highbury Corner Magistrates' Court. District judge Susan Williams also ordered him to pay Â£145 in costs and charges. She said that, although Carlisle had made a ""positive contribution"" to others through football, she had to sentence him for the risk his ""erratic"" driving had created. ""If you are not in control of your vehicle in a road in central London you represent a danger to people,"" she said.

The nomination of Mr Stefanini was seen as a litmus test for Pope Francis, who has taken a more liberal stance on homosexuality. A French government spokesman said there had been negotiations with the Vatican over the appointment. ""France has chosen its ambassador to the Vatican. This choice was Stefanini and that remains the French proposal,"" said spokesman Stephane Le Foll. Observers say most Vatican appointments are confirmed within six weeks and that this long silence should be read as a rejection. The Vatican traditionally makes no statement if it intends to decline a nomination. Mr Stefanini served in the Holy See as a deputy ambassador in the French embassy from 2001 to 2005. He was described by the country's foreign ministry as ""one of our best diplomats"". France legalised same-sex marriage in 2013, despite opposition from the Catholic Church.

cohere_xlarge-20220609,GPs are being paid to reduce the number of patient referrals to hospitals.,"GP practices are being paid to help local NHS groups limit the number of patient referrals and cut costs, the doctors' magazine Pulse found. Appointments affected include scans and consultations with specialists - including those for cancer patients. The British Medical Association said such incentives were ""misguided"". At least nine clinical commissioning groups (CCGs) were offering GP practices payments for hitting targets, according to Pulse's investigation. In one case, Birmingham South Central CCG was offering practices more than Â£11,000 to reduce new outpatient attendances, follow-ups, A&E attendances and emergency admissions by 1%, compared with 2014/15. It said the schemes, which exclude cancer referrals, were designed to ""incentivise best quality practice"" and ""drive improvements in the quality of primary medical care"". ""Our priority is to ensure that patients have access to services that they need, when they need them,"" said a spokesperson for Birmingham South Central CCG. Another CCG told Pulse it had considered the ""full impact"" of the incentive scheme and was ""confident that there is no conflict of interest"". Pulse said that one scheme had already been looked at by the General Medical Council, the body which regulates medical standards in the UK, after local GP leaders expressed their concern. The magazine pointed out that initial hospital referrals for cancer patients should happen within two weeks of a GP first suspecting the condition. Dr Chand Nagpaul, chairman of the GPs committee of the doctors' trade union the British Medical Association, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that such schemes were a ""financial contaminant"" to patient-doctor trust. He said: ""It's short-sighted and misguided of CCGs to introduce such mechanisms, because they do lead to the potential for patients questioning the motives of GP referrals. ""We believe it is far more appropriate for CCGs to introduce clinical pathways that ensure patients are referred appropriately rather than these crude, salesman-like bonuses which pay GPs simply to make reduction to referrals in numerical terms."" Dr Peter Melton is local GP and clinical chief officer for North East Lincolnshire CCG, which offers the equivalent of more than Â£6,000 to practices that reduce outpatient referrals to the same level as the 25% with the lowest referral rates (which include two-week urgent cancer referrals) in 2014/15. He said the CCG was already among the best in England for referring suspected cancer patients to a consultant within two weeks and the scheme was not about avoiding sending people to hospital. ""It is not focussing on referral reduction per se but on better clinical and quality standards for the patient,"" he explained. ""The expectation is practices will be encouraged to investigate more locally and monitor the patient in the first instance rather than automatically refer in to a secondary care service.""

cohere_xlarge-20220609,Gaga has been rehearsing for her Super Bowl half-time show for months.,"With a television audience of 110 million, it's one of the biggest platforms in the world - and Gaga has been putting in the hours to ensure her set is suitably spectacular. ""We were [rehearsing] in the tent for about a week and a half, then we had to move to bigger studios in Hollywood where we are working on the rest of the show,"" she told Houston radio station Mix 96.5. ""And then we will send that equipment to Houston where we will finish rehearsals. Fans can expect a performance that spans my career so far."" She has a high standard to live up to - notably Prince's show in 2007, which took place in the middle of a Miami thunderstorm and is widely accepted as the greatest performance in the event's history, if not Prince's career. Here are some of the other most memorable - and surprising - moments from the last 30 years. Super Bowl performers get a very strict 12-minute time limit, so most performers cram their set with as much music as possible. Not Michael Jackson. After shooting onto the stage at the Pasadena Rose Bowl, he stood completely still, staring at the world for a full 90 seconds. Ninety. It was a master class in ratcheting expectation to a fever pitch. And the screams when he launched into Jam (not one of his best songs) proved he knew what he was doing. Brilliantly, Jackson staged this entire performance while wearing a jacket it looked like he'd borrowed from Muammar Gaddafi. Beat that, Gaga. Baby, he was born to run... and slide on his knees... and crotch slam a TV camera. In his autobiography, The Boss explains the incident like this: ""Too much adrenalin, a late drop, too much speed, here I come, Mikeâ€¦ BOOM! ""And I'm onto his camera, the lens implanted into my chest with one leg off the stage. I use his camera to push myself back up andâ€¦ BLAM! BORN TO RUN!"" It led to the memorable headline: ""America Attacked by Bruce Springsteen's crotch"" - but it didn't stop the star delivering one of the most powerful and energetic Super Bowl shows in recent history. Even if they were fined for over-running by 40 seconds. Coldplay were the headline act at last year's Super Bowl in Santa Clara - but someone forgot to tell Beyonce. She only performed one song, Formation, underscoring its message of black pride and power with back-up dancers dressed in leather body suits and black berets reminiscent of the Black Panthers movement. Some of her dancers were even pictured holding up a sign declaring ""Justice 4 Mario Woods"" - a 26-year-old black man who was shot dead by armed police in San Francisco two months earlier. The performance heralded the arrival of her unapologetically political album, Lemonade, later in the year.

The apes began to disappear from the documents about 150 years ago, corresponding with population growth. The study is published in the Proceedings of the Royal Society B. Hainan gibbons are now limited to a few isolated patches of forest in the south west of China. They live in just four social groups, one of which was only discovered a few weeks ago. Understanding this population crash has been difficult, but the old government documents have helped to reveal when and how the numbers fell. Dr Sam Turvey, from the Zoological Society of London, said: ""China is one of the few places in the world that has a very very rich, long historical record. ""Because it has had such a complex bureaucracy for so long, there has been a lot of need for reporting - not just numbers of households for tax purposes and things like that, but also in terms of the kinds of natural resources that were available in the immediate environment."" These included records of animals, including gibbons, he said. ""We looked at the pattern of disappearance of gibbons through time and how that varied from place to place and the different environmental conditions and human pressures that were also present in these places."" The archives show that gibbons were a common sight in about 20 provinces in China well into the 17th and 18th Century. However, Dr Turvey said it was ""a stark contrast to their very imperilled position today"". ""We see a really steep increase in population decline and real population collapse across China about 100-150 years ago,"" he added. ""And this correlates with demographic expansion in China towards the end of the Imperial era and through the 20th Century, and the massive increase in deforestation and human population growth through the time of the Chinese Republic and the establishment of the communist party."" The researchers said a better understanding of the animals' decline would help them to establish a conservation plan for the country's last few Hainan gibbons. Dr Turvey said: ""It is an incredible privilege to be able to see gibbons in China in the wild. ""The Hainan gibbon is such as rare species, but knowing that this species is still hanging on there gives you hope that conservation will be able to bring that population back from the brink.""

cohere_xlarge-20220609,"Harper Lee, the author of To Kill a Mockingbird, has never explained why she stopped writing.","Harper Lee's classic was published 50 years ago this summer and it remains the only novel she ever wrote. Lee, 84, has never explained why she stopped writing. She doesn't give interviews - ""Hell, no"" was her response to a request several decades ago - and that silence has only added to the intrigue. But her close friend Thomas Lane Butts, a retired minister in her hometown, Monroeville, Alabama, says she once told him the reason. Sitting on a pew in the Methodist church which the Lee family still attends, he described to me how she suddenly brought the subject up one night over dinner in New York. ""She asked me, 'You ever wonder why I didn't write anything else?' And I said, 'Along with several million other people, yes, I had wondered about that.' And she said, 'Well, what do you think?'"" Speaking in his slow southern drawl, the Rev Butts, who just turned 80, suggested to her that she had already written a great book and therefore didn't need to compete with herself. ""And when I got through she said, 'You're all wrong.' I said, 'Alright, smart Alec. You tell me.' She said, 'I would not go through all the deprivation of privacy through which I went for this book again for any amount of money.' ""And she said, 'I did not need to write another book. I said what I wanted to say in that book.'"" Harper Lee called it a simple tale about the ""conflict of the human soul"" and Monroeville, Alabama, is where she drew her inspiration. The story depicts the segregated South of her childhood, during the Depression. It was published at the height of the civil rights struggle. The Rev Butts grew up 10 miles outside Monroeville. By the late 1950s, he says, he was a ""fuzzy-cheeked young preacher"" campaigning for an end to segregation. He had met Martin Luther King Jr and signed a petition to boycott buses. The Ku Klux Klan had left a burning cross on his front lawn. He says To Kill a Mockingbird was not well received in Monroeville when it was published. ""The people who were hard racist did not like it because of the implication of the book,"" the Rev Butts told me. ""The book revealed racism and that always frightens a racist - when you pull the cover off them. ""Those of us who stood up for civil rights were much encouraged by the book because in a very skilful and subtle way it addressed itself for justice."" But these days, the Rev Butts says, there is enormous civic pride in Monroeville. The old courthouse, which Hollywood re-created for the film, now houses a museum to Harper Lee and the town's other literary icon, Truman Capote. Capote was a childhood friend of hers and is thought to be the inspiration for the Dill character in To Kill a Mockingbird. The town's residents often try to protect Lee, allowing her to live a normal life instead of being hounded by fans or bothered with prying questions. ""Being famous",1,5,4
cohere_xlarge-20220609,Hibs have appointed Neil Lennon as their new manager.,"His previous jobs were at Celtic and Bolton, but moving to the second tier of Scottish football was no hindrance to him returning to work at Easter Road. Lennon saw the vacancy as an opportunity, and that was enough to encourage Hibs that a figure of his profile and experience would accept a role in the Championship. Even though his last job in Scotland involved leading a team on Champions League duty, Lennon's mind has not been swayed by haughtiness. The appointment of the former Celtic manager as successor to Alan Stubbs suits both parties, because it is mutually beneficial. Success is alluring, and Hibs offer Lennon the chance to accumulate more achievements. He was immediately engaged in crisis management at his previous club Bolton, but will find stability, potential and accomplishment at Easter Road. The demand will be to deliver promotion, but that will not seem daunting when the majority of the squad that pushed Rangers for a while last season then won the Scottish Cup is still in place. Lennon's task is to refine and bolster the team, when new managers are often faced with a period of overhaul. Stubbs left the club on an emotional high after delivering their first Scottish Cup in 114 years, but before the final against Rangers there was a tangible sense of exasperation that promotion had been missed. Hibs were entitled to feel that it was an unnecessary failure given their circumstances. The club is about to embark on a third season in the Championship, but by most other measures they can be considered a top-flight outfit. The budget will be significantly more than the rest of the teams in the division, the training ground at East Mains and facilities are first-class, the football side of the business is stable and well-run by George Craig, the club's head of football operations, the squad is full of talent. Lennon can rely on consistently assured performances from the likes of David Gray, Darren McGregor, Paul Hanlon, Lewis Stevenson, John McGinn, Fraser Fyvie, Dylan McGeouch, James Keatings and Jason Cummings. Some minor issues remain, such as who will fill the goal next season, but the challenge is more on adding depth and strength of will to the squad and man-management. McGinn, one of the most reliably effective players in the Championship last season, has already insisted that he remains committed to Hibs despite the failure to achieve promotion. The 21-year-old midfielder provides the kind of industry and spirit that a team can be built around. There may be critical decisions to make, though, since Cummings is entering the final year of his contract and so represents a sellable asset. He is a regular goalscorer, though, and Stubbs had to sign Anthony Stokes on loan last January to provide some support up front. These are tweaks compared to the amount of work Stubbs had to carry out when he was appointed two years ago. Hibs are ready to be guided forward, not waiting to be rescued.

That is down from 6.1% in the previous quarter. Analysts were expecting the same figure for January to March. India is the third-largest economy in Asia but has been struggling with inflation and currency weakness. Since July last year, the Indian rupee has seen one of the biggest declines among Asian currencies, dropping more than 27% against the US dollar. ""Shocking numbers as growth was even lower than lows witnessed during the financial crisis,"" said Anubhuti Sahay from Standard Chartered Bank in Mumbai. The BBC's Yogita Limaye in Mumbai said that just a year ago India was aspiring for double-digit growth. But a global slowdown has reduced external demand, and high inflation coupled with a weak rupee has made things more expensive within the country. Domestic demand, which India's economy is largely reliant on, has also slowed in part due to the political upheaval in the country. India's economy is suffering from ""policy incoherence, shifting global risk appetite and a comatose government"", said Rajeev Malik, senior economist at brokerage CLSA India's Prime Minister Manmohan Singh admitted early this month that his government must do more to get the once fast-growing economy moving again.

Election officials have urged patience. Uhuru Kenyatta, who faces trial at the International Criminal Court, has been leading in early presidential results declared from Monday's tightly contested election. He is due to stand trial at The Hague next month for allegedly fuelling violence after the disputed 2007 election. He denies the charge. His closest rival is outgoing Prime Minister Raila Odinga. With provisional results in from more than 40% of polling stations earlier on Wednesday, Mr Odinga had 42% of the vote compared with Mr Kenyatta's 53%. However, Mr Odinga's allies remain confident that he will gain ground as results from his strongholds, including the Coast Province, are declared. More than 1,000 people were killed in the violence which broke out in 2007-08 after Mr Odinga claimed he had been cheated of victory by supporters of President Mwai Kibaki, who is stepping down after two terms in office. The BBC's Solomon Mugera in the capital, Nairobi, says Kenyans are becoming increasingly anxious about the delay in finalising the results. Some businesses and schools across the country have remained shut since Monday's election, he says. This has led to a shortage of goods, pushing up the prices of basic foodstuff in areas such as Kibera, the biggest slum in Nairobi and a stronghold of Mr Odinga, our correspondent adds. Uhuru Kenyatta Raila Odinga Profile: Uhuru Kenyatta Profile: Raila Odinga Some electoral officials have had to drive hundreds of kilometres to the counting centre in Nairobi to deliver paper copies of the tally of their returns. At about 13:00 local time, returning officers from only 53 of the 290 constituencies had arrived and the election commission said it would announce results from constituencies as they were ready. Its website had stopped giving updated results from the presidential race on Wednesday, and was still showing figures from Tuesday night. Our correspondent says the large number of spoiled ballots - about 6% of the total vote, well over double the number of votes cast for the third-placed candidate, Musailia Mudavadi - has become a major bone of contention. Mr Odinga's Coalition of Reforms and Democracy (Cord) wants them to be counted, but Mr Kenyatta's Jubilee Coalition is resisting this. Late on Tuesday, the election commission announced that the spoiled ballots would count in the overall vote total, increasing the likelihood of a run-off between the top two candidates, news agencies report. Mr Kenyatta's running mate William Ruto, who is also facing a trial at the ICC, said foreign embassies may have influenced such a decision. ""We want to believe that this is not an attempt to deny the Jubilee Coalition a first-round victory as is clearly now on the wall,"" he is quoted by Reuters news agency as saying. But the election commission now says a decision on what to do about the spoiled ballots will be taken after all other votes are counted, our correspondent reports.

cohere_xlarge-20220609,Leicestershire County Council is facing a £19m budget black hole every year after the latest cutbacks.,"Byron Rhodes is taking me around the modern council headquarters. It's full of light. It's busy. The building has regenerated the area around Melton Mowbray's railway station, once a muddy pot-holed piece of wasteland where those in the know parked for free. Now the council offices link the station to a park and the town centre. It was partly paid for with insurance money after a fire destroyed the old offices on the other side of town. A supermarket moved in to replace it and helped with the money too, putting the council on a firm financial footing. But that was four years ago and the crisis is a different one today. It's being experienced by all local authorities - cuts in central government funding which threaten the services they provide. Mr Rhodes is also deputy leader of Leicestershire County Council, with responsibility for finance. Leicestershire is historically the poorest funded council in the country because of a quirk of Whitehall recalculations, going back a quarter of a century since the poll tax, or community charge, was scrapped. At the moment councils get income from council tax, a share of the business rates, any income they generate themselves from services plus a grant from central government. It's the grant cut which is causing them grief. What's called the ""core funding"" is worked out by the number of homes multiplied by a set amount. And each authority has a different value set per dwelling. If we look at Surrey, which is top of the table, the amount will be £1,686 by 2019/20. Nottinghamshire is mid-table at £1,482, Derbyshire is in the lower reaches with £1,422 per dwelling and then comes Leicestershire at £1,354. ""The funding system is chaotic,"" says Byron Rhodes. ""It doesn't reflect real need. Look at Oxfordshire which is an interesting example,"" he says with a glint in his eye. Could he possibly be referring to the prime ministerial plea to the county council about cutbacks to services there? ""If we had the same funding as Oxfordshire, we'd have £50m a year extra. If we had the same as Surrey, we'd have £100m more. We'd be partying everyday if we had that kind of money."" Leicestershire have been helped with a small share of what's been called transitional funding - about £300m to help councils following pressure from Conservative MPs. Think back to the vote on Sunday trading. With a majority of only 17 in the Commons, the Conservatives lost the vote when 20 odd rebelled. Last month there would've been another rebellion, including some of our own Tory MPs in the East Midlands, if something wasn't done to improve the local government finance settlement over the next four years. The money has gone largely to shire counties. Leicestershire got £6.6m spread over two years, enough to save some services from closure. But it's a drop in the ocean for an authority with a £19m black hole in the budget every year after the latest cutbacks. Labour have protested that 83% of the councils getting transition funding are Conservative-run. Many Labour-run",1,5,5

It was the first time the 32-year-old Spaniard had driven the car for the Oxfordshire-based Marussia team. Inspectors from the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) visited the test track on Wednesday. Marussia said surgeons at Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge ""embarked on a lengthy procedure to address the serious head and facial injuries sustained by Maria in the accident"". It said: ""The operation began yesterday afternoon and she was in theatre until this morning. ""Maria remains in a critical but stable condition."" John Booth, team principal of the Marussia F1 Team, said: ""Maria emerged from theatre at Addenbrooke's Hospital this morning after a lengthy operation to address the serious head and facial injuries she received in the accident at Duxford Airfield yesterday. ""We are grateful for the medical attention that Maria has been receiving and her family would like to thank the Neurological and Plastics surgical teams. ""However, it is with great sadness that I must report that, due to the injuries she sustained, Maria has lost her right eye. ""Maria's care and the wellbeing of her family remain our priority at this time. Her family are at the hospital and we are doing everything possible to support them."" De Villota sustained her injuries after her car ""suddenly accelerated"" into the back of the support lorry, according to witnesses. BBC Radio Cambridgeshire presenter Chris Mann, who saw the accident, said: ""The top of her car and her helmet seemed to take the brunt of it. ""She didn't move for about 15 minutes."" He said De Villota had been driving at up to 200mph during the testing, but the car was travelling considerably slower at the time of the crash. Mr Booth said: ""With regard to the accident, we have embarked on a very comprehensive analysis of what happened and this work continues for the moment."" Messages of support have come in from the motor racing world, including ones from Ferrari driver and fellow Spaniard Fernando Alonso and Jenson Button. Formula 1 driver and BBC analyst Jaime Alguersari said in his weekly column : ""I was shocked to hear of the accident suffered by Maria de Villota. I know her and her family very well. I still don't know the cause of the accident. There are so many rumours but I want to wait to see what really happened. ""It's terribly sad.

cohere_xlarge-20220609,"Mead, a drink made from fermented honey, is becoming more popular in the US.","But what's brewing in this new crop of commercial meaderies - as they are known - is lot more refined from the drink that once decorated tables across medieval Europe. ""Do we have any mead makers or home brewers in the group?"" asks Ben Alexander, eying a crowd of a dozen or so people who have come to his Maine Meade Works, in Portland, on a rainy Friday for a tour. When no-one raises their hand, Mr Alexander launches into the full spiel. ""If you guys want to come around, I'll show you how this thing works,"" he says, gesturing to two ceiling-high columns of stainless steel filled with something resembling a mushy golden porridge. ""We mix up honey and water over there and we pump it through a hot water bath at 160 degrees [71C] in a stainless steel coil here. Each one produces about 50 to 75 gallons [227-340 litres] of mead a day,"" explains Mr Alexander. It's fair to say he is obsessed with mead. ""It's the quintessential local beverage - you can go anywhere in the world and find honey to make mead, and I think that's unique among alcoholic beverages,"" he gushes. After being introduced to the drink by a home brewer, Mr Alexander thought there were profits to be had in a commercial meadery. He founded Maine Mead Works in 2008, pouring his savings and money from friends and family into the business. His business has since grown, along with the popularity of mead in the US. It's now a seven-person operation that manufactures more than 7,500 cases a year, shipping them as far away as China. Mr Alexander is not the only one to have caught on to the commercial potential of mead. Vicky Rowe, the owner of mead information website GotMead, says interest in the product in the US has exploded in the past decade. ""We went from 30-40 meaderies making mead to somewhere in the vicinity of 250 in the last 10 years,"" she says. ""I like to say that everything old is new again - people come back to what was good once."" Even visitors to Mr Alexander's meadery agree. Tour participant Dirk Heseman admitted that while Maine Mead Works was the first meadery he'd actually visited, he has noticed that mead ""is becoming more and more available - similar to cider"". Just this year, commercial meaderies in the US have banded together to form an industry group, the American Mead Makers Association, to better share information and encourage growth in the industry. But there's a lot of work that needs to be done to improve the image of a drink long associated with Renaissance fairs and medieval re-enactments. ""I think our number one challenge as an industry is awareness of what mead is,"" says Mr Alexander. ""You ask 10 people in a room if they've ever heard of mead, and two of them might say, 'yes', and only one of them has had a very positive experience."" The mead of the past was often sweet, and didn't appeal to many drinkers",1,5,4

cohere_xlarge-20220609,More than half of young people in foster care in Scotland have had to move home more than three times.,"Research carried out by the Fostering Network suggests almost half of fostered young people are already living with their third foster family since going into care. The group has warned that 750 more foster carers are ""urgently"" needed to meet the demands of the care system. It urged people to ""open their hearts and homes"" to vulnerable youngsters. Currently, more than 5,500 children are in foster care in Scotland, living with 4,400 families and carers. The Fostering Network surveyed 250 children, teenagers and foster carers across Scotland and discovered that many young people had failed to find stability. Almost half were already living with their third family, a quarter were with their fourth family and about 20 were living with their 10th family since going into care. There was a particular need for homes to be found for vulnerable teenagers, siblings and disabled children, the study found. Carla, 23, was taken into care at the age of 12 and had eight foster homes before moving in with the Randalls. ""Looking back now I realised that the Randalls saved my life,"" she said. ""I never understood the extent of the neglect and abuse I had endured until I came to live with a 'normal' loving family. ""They were just always themselves, the smallest details meant so much to me. ""They nurtured a young, angry, untrusting teenager to become a positive, empathetic and successful young woman."" The Fostering Network said instability had a detrimental effect on the child's education and wellbeing, while finding a stable foster carer from the outset could lead to improved relationships and a happier childhood. Sara Lurie, director of the Fostering Network Scotland, said: ""As each year passes, we see more and more children coming into care. ""We need people who can open their heart, and their homes, to vulnerable children and young people and use their skills to help support them to reach their full potential. ""In particular we need people who have the skills, patience and passion to look after teenagers who may have had a really tough time and be facing some real challenges, and to offer them love, stability and security. ""A good foster carer will believe in the ambition of the children in their care in the same way they'd believe in the ambition of their biological family members."" Apologies for the delay, see below as requested. A Scottish government spokeswoman said: ""Giving young people security is paramount and we have done a great deal of work with our partners across local government and the third sector to improve how we intervene early when there is a problem within families to find appropriate solutions quickly. ""We have also expanded the age at which young people can remain in foster care as part of the continuing care provisions and the support available when they transition into independent living.""",1,5,4
cohere_xlarge-20220609,Morocco has been readmitted to the African Union after a 33-year absence.,"It was a ""good opportunity"" and ""a chance to work together,"" a top Western Sahara official told the BBC. Morocco controls two-thirds of Western Sahara and sees it as part of its historic territory. However some, including the UN, see Western Sahara as Africa's last colony. Africa Live: More on this and other stories Find out more about Western Sahara A referendum was promised in 1991 but never carried out due to wrangling over who was eligible to vote. Thousands of Sahrawi refugees still live in refugee camps in Algeria - some have been there for 40 years. It is not clear what happens next but Western Sahara is hopeful that a committee set up by the AU will address the issues that both sides have raised. Some AU delegates said that it would be easier to resolve the issue with Morocco inside the AU. Sidi Mohammed, a Western Sahara official, told the BBC that Morocco's return to the AU means that it would now be expected to put ""in practice decisions taken by the AU with regard to a referendum in Western Sahara"". Mr Mohammed dismissed the suggestion that Morocco would now seek to get the AU to change its position, saying that the no country could unilaterally change the AU fundamental agreement, saying it opposed colonisation. In his speech at the AU summit, King Mohammed VI of Morocco said the readmission was not meant to divide the continental body. No. Algeria has always been a big supporter of Western Sahara's Polisario Front and it had wanted Morocco to accept independence of the territory as a condition for readmission. Zimbabwe and South Africa were also supportive of this stance but they were outnumbered by those who wanted Morocco back in the fold. There is no specific provision in the AU charter that bars any country from joining it. Morocco simply applied and the request was accepted by more than two-thirds of the 53 members. Morocco has been involved in intense lobbying and applied in July last year to rejoin the continental body. King Mohammed toured various African countries seeking support for the bid. No. While culturally the country's identity aligns with Arab states, its economic interests increasingly lie in Africa. This is a strategic move to continue exploring its interests in mining, construction, medical, insurance and banking sectors on the continent.

He added: ""We have a lot of beautiful things to fight for and to qualify for the Champions League will be a huge success. But we have to be honest with ourselves. We were not good enough to compete for the Premier League [title]."" Defeat at Stamford Bridge left City just four points ahead of Arsenal and Manchester United, both of whom have a game in hand. With the FA Cup being City's only realistic chance of winning a trophy this term, it is likely to be the worst season of Guardiola's managerial career.

There have been conflicting claims about the precise nature of the row, but stewards were needed to calm the situation down after Chelsea's 2-1 win.

Some of the items found included an armour-piercing improvised rocket and two anti-personnel mines. The main line of police inquiry is the arms belonged to dissident republicans. Last week, Home Secretary Theresa May said MI5 believed an attack on targets in Great Britain by dissident republicans had become ""a strong possibility"". Analysis: Vincent Kearney, BBC News NI's home affairs correspondent The discovery of what appears to be a second dissident republican arms dump near Larne within three months has left police baffled. Based on location alone, the analysis would be that the items found most likely belonged to loyalist paramilitaries. But the nature of what was found suggests otherwise and the finger of suspicion firmly in the direction of dissident republicans. Det Supt Kevin Geddes said the threat level in Northern Ireland from dissident republican groups remains ""severe"" and an attack is ""highly likely"". Police officers found three barrels hidden in holes in the forest. As well as rockets and mines, there were also several pipe bombs, assault rifle ammunition and parts to construct a ""substantial number of explosive devices"". Det Supt Geddes said the seizure was significant ""both in terms of its size and its capability"". ""A number of these devices were ready to be deployed,"" he added. ""This seizure has undoubtedly saved lives."" He said the type of weapons that had been found meant police would focus their investigation on dissident republicans. In March, an arms find was made at Carnfunnock Country Park near Larne, and police said the were investigating a connection between the two discoveries. ""There are links in terms of the general location and the manner and method of storage and packaging of these munitions,"" Det Supt Geddes said.

The article also said he had warned the PM the UK would have to pay its ""fair share"" and spend 2% of GDP on defence. In response, Number 10 said there were ""many difficult challenges"" in Libya, while the White House said it deeply valued the UK's contributions. Downing Street did not comment on President Obama's remark to the PM about defence spending, reportedly made before Chancellor George Osborne said the government would fulfil a Nato pledge to spend 2% of national income on defence last year. In response to the interview, a spokesman for the US National Security Council said Mr Cameron had been ""as close a partner as the president has had"" adding that ""we deeply value the UK's contributions on our shared national security and foreign policy objectives"". BBC North America editor Jon Sopel said the unsolicited statement put out by the White House suggested Downing Street had reacted angrily to the article. ""It's like we've seen a curtain drawn back on the unspun thoughts of President Obama, complete with frustration as well, and what we've seen tonight is the White House trying to close the curtain as quickly as it can,"" he added. The toppling of the Gaddafi regime in Libya - following UN-backed air strikes designed to protect civilians - led to a power vacuum and instability, with no authority in full control. The intervention was led by the UK and France - and in his interview, Mr Obama reflects on ""what went wrong"", saying: ""There's room for criticism, because I had more faith in the Europeans, given Libya's proximity, being invested in the follow-up."" Mr Cameron, he said, became ""distracted by a range of other things"". He also criticised former French President Nicolas Sarkozy, saying he had tried to claim the spotlight. The former French president, he said, ""wanted to trumpet the flights he was taking in the air campaign, despite the fact that we had wiped out all the air defences and essentially set up the entire infrastructure"" for the intervention. President Obama said the intervention ""averted large-scale civilian casualties (and) prevented what almost surely would have been a prolonged and bloody civil conflict"". But he added: ""And despite all that, Libya is a mess."" He also criticised what he called ""free riders"" in the interview, saying European and Gulf countries were calling for action against Gaddafi, adding: ""But what has been a habit over the last several decades in these circumstances is people pushing us to act but then showing an unwillingness to put any skin in the game."" Despite efforts to support Libya's National Transitional Council, and the first elections in the country for decades, it rapidly descended into violence, with two rival governments and the formation of hundreds of militias, some allied to so-called Islamic State.

cohere_xlarge-20220609,Ricky Burns has become Scotland's first three-weight world champion after beating Michele Di Rocco in Glasgow.,"With three defeats in his previous six bouts, the Scottish boxer's career seemed to be on the wane. But his power, timing and focus returned in a supremely confident display at Glasgow's Hydro on Saturday night as he clinched the vacant WBA World Super-Lightweight title - and entered the record books as the first Scot to win world titles at three weights. Italy's Michele Di Rocco, at 34 a year older than Burns, hadn't lost a fight since September 2007. He arrived with a record of 40 wins and a draw from 42 bouts. He left a lesser figure. The referee deemed the man from Assisi to be in no state to continue in the eighth round, the result of a welter of blows to his head and body and made all the more unbearable by the hostile acoustic energy generated by 8,000 Scottish fans. Surely, for Burns, this was time to shout about his record, the ideal moment to counter all those who had written him off and questioned the wisdom of him leaving trainer Billy Nelson two years ago to work with Tony Sim in Essex? No. Instead, the champion spoke of his disbelief at the ease of his victory, his gratitude that he was safe, of his thanks to promoter Eddie Hearn, manager Alex Morrison and coach Sim for believing in him, and of his desire to celebrate with a fast-food burger and 20 chicken nuggets. ""When I got in the ring after the fight, I said, 'You've done it! You've done it!',"" reported a beaming Hearn at the post-fight media conference. ""And you know what Ricky said? 'Can you get a picture with me and Michael Buffer [the legendary American boxing ring announcer]?'"" When he has time to reflect during a well-earned holiday, Burns will take immense satisfaction at being only the third British-born fighter, after Bob Fitzsimmons and Duke McKenzie, to be a three-weight world champion. In Scottish terms, his achievements must mean that he is in the very top tier of boxing greats, comfortably mentioned in the same breath as former world champions Benny Lynch, Walter McGowan, Jackie Paterson, Ken Buchanan and Jim Watt, for example. Burns' record stands at 40 wins from 46 bouts. Remarkably, 11 of those have been world title fights. Buchanan's exploits in the United States add lustre to his legacy, but while Burns may never have fought someone like Roberto Duran, should Hearn manage to set up a bout against Cincinnati's Adrien Broner, the four-time world champion stripped of the WBA title because he could not make the weight, then Burns could achieve little more in the sport. ""There are some big fights out there for me,"" said Burns. ""I want to fight the top names. I will fight anybody. I do super-lightweight comfortably and lightweight is still an option.

cohere_xlarge-20220609,Ruskin College in Oxford has cut its English and Women's Studies courses.,"It comes after Ruskin College's governing body agreed to cut two of its six BA programmes and one of its three MA courses to save money. College principal Chris Wilkes said the decision was related to ""low student numbers rather than any other reason"". He said it would continue to focus on adult education. Famous Ruskin College alumni include former deputy prime minister John Prescott and Dennis Skinner, MP for Bolsover in Derbyshire. BA English Studies, BA History with Social Sciences and MA Women's Studies are being discontinued. Anne Hughes, 63, from Thame in Oxfordshire, has been studying BA English Studies part-time at the college for two years. She said she was ""absolutely distraught"" it was being cut. She is physically disabled and has depression, and said she chose to study at the college because it worked with ""disadvantaged, disabled and mature students"". The college also offers bespoke timetables, unlike some other places of higher education, she added. Online petitions have been set up in a bid to save the English faculty and the Women's Studies course. One signatory, Jenny Lewis, wrote on the first petition: ""[Tutors] Helen Kidd and Tom Sherry are carrying on the great Ruskin tradition of bringing opportunities to those that otherwise would not have them."" Student and activist Saskia Ritchie, who set up the second petition, said Ruskin had been set up for ""people who would traditionally be excluded from academia"" and gives ""access to truly excellent learning opportunities"". Mr Wilkes said the college would lose about 25 students as a result of the cuts. He added degrees had been on offer at the college for about 10 years and were ""relatively new"" considering the college's 116-year history. ""Our focus will continue to be on educating adults and I think what we're doing is just renewing our offer but doing it in a different way, fulfilling our mission in a different way, to perhaps how we've done it in the past,"" Mr Wilkes added. The college previously lost funding from the Skills Development Agency.",1,5,4
cohere_xlarge-20220609,Russia's new internet law will make it harder for bloggers to remain anonymous.,"It means bloggers with more than 3,000 daily readers must register with the mass media regulator, Roskomnadzor, and conform to the regulations that govern the country's larger media outlets. Internet companies will also be required to allow Russian authorities access to users' information. One human rights group called the move ""draconian"". The law was approved by Russia's upper house of parliament in April. It includes measures to ensure that bloggers cannot remain anonymous, and states that social networks must maintain six months of data on its users. The information must be stored on servers based in Russian territory, so that government authorities can gain access. Critics see it as the latest in a series of recent moves to curb internet freedom. Hugh Williamson, of New York-based Human Rights Watch, has called the law ""another milestone in Russia's relentless crackdown on free expression"". ""The internet is the last island of free expression in Russia and these draconian regulations are clearly aimed at putting it under government control,"" he added. Opposition figures have used the internet to air their views, with some gaining millions of followers. Commentators opposing Vladimir Putin often face restrictions in broadcast outlets and newspapers. Analysis: Famil Ismailov, news editor, BBCRussian.com Russian bloggers are bracing themselves for the moment when Russia's new ""information security law"" comes into force on 1 August. Some already share advice on how to use proxy servers in order to access social media sites that, in their view, are under threat of being closed. It is hard to see how the law will be enforced. The servers for most of the popular social media platforms that many Russians use are based outside Russia. Many popular bloggers are already looking for, and apparently finding, ways to ""cheat"" the feature that counts page visits and keep their daily unique visitor numbers just under 3000, or to make sure that the statistics are hidden altogether. Anton Nossik, who is considered Russia's ""internet guru"", wrote in his LiveJournal blog that the new law didn't threaten individual bloggers directly, but provided legal grounds to block popular social networks like Facebook, Twitter, LiveJournal and Google. ""The issue of banning all these platforms in Russia is a political one and it will be decided by only one person"", Mr Nossik wrote, with a thinly veiled reference to President Vladimir Putin. Earlier in the year, Russia enacted a law that gave the government powers to block websites without explanation. In March, Moscow blocked the blog of Mr Navalny, along with two news sites and a organisation run by Garry Kasparov - a vocal critic of the Russian government. In a statement, Russia's prosecutor general's office said the blocks were imposed because of the sites' role in helping stage illegal protests. Earlier this week, Twitter blocked access to an anti-Kremlin account that often publishes leaked government documents, following a request by Russia's federal communications agency Roskomnadzor. For many years, Russia had relatively lax internet laws. However Moscow has recently changed its tune, with Mr Putin branding the internet an ongoing ""CIA project"". He also claimed that",1,5,3
cohere_xlarge-20220609,Russian authorities have blocked access to a number of pornographic websites.,"Internet service providers had until Tuesday to implement the ban. The sites now redirect to a message explaining they have been blocked ""by decision of public authorities"". In 2015, the authorities banned 11 popular pornography websites, saying many failed to protect children ""from information harmful to their health"". Analysis by Vitaliy Shevchenko, BBC Monitoring The decision was made following two separate court rulings, which said the websites ""spread pornography"". Sexually explicit content is not outlawed in Russia, but the law bans ""the illegal production, dissemination and advertisement of pornographic materials and objects"". It is not uncommon for Russia to ban websites. The government agency Roskomnadzor maintains a blacklist that now includes thousands of them. Access is usually blocked for violating the notoriously vague extremism legislation or child protection laws. Websites critical of the Kremlin have been blocked too, and at one point Wikipedia was blacklisted. Following the 2015 ban, one woman asked Roskomnadzor on Twitter whether it could recommend an alternative. The agency replied: ""You can meet someone in real life."" On Tuesday, it said its earlier tweet was ""still relevant"". However, open rights campaigners have warned that local bans can be defeated. ""Blocking porn is the fastest way to ensure widespread adoption of censorship circumvention in your country,"" said Eva Galperin, global policy analyst at the Electronic Frontier Foundation. One of the affected porn sites offered Roskomnadzor a premium subscription to its service, in exchange for lifting the ban. The government agency said it was ""not in the market"" for such an offer. Nadya Tolokonnikova, lead singer from punk band Pussy Riot, joked that the ban was ""a blow below the belt"".",1,5,4

The cuts are being blamed on reduced government spending and a drop in National Lottery ticket sales - a major contributor to sports backing. Governing bodies are bracing themselves for potential job losses. About 60% of funding is made up from Scottish Government money, with lottery sales making up the rest. In the year ending 2015, total revenue was £65.1m, which is divided up and awarded to 52 sports. By the end of next year, that figure will have fallen to £51.8m - a cut to the Scottish sporting budget of 20% in just three years. sportscotland chairman Mel Young said: ""It's heartbreaking to me because I know the effort the sport governing bodies and the community that's around it; the volunteers and the mums and dads. ""And, to have to say that we're having to cut some money back is, I believe, not the right way to go."" Former badminton player Susan Egelstaff, a double bronze medallist at the Commonwealth Games [in 2002 and 2006] and an Olympian, fears the cuts will have ""a huge impact"". ""What that means in the future is that Scotland will be constantly playing catch-up,"" she said. ""It's almost impossible to catch up if you fall too far behind the leading nations."" The Scottish Government said sport and physical activity play a ""key role"" in a healthy Scotland and that ""significant"" investment would continue in those areas. ""Having successfully delivered the Commonwealth Games [in 2014] we are now focusing on protecting or raising investment in areas intended to decrease health inequality and improve life chances, and the small reduction in the sport budget allows us to support those priorities,"" Minister for Sport Aileen Campbell said. ""There is on-going support for active lifestyles through capital investment in cycling and walking, and over the last 10 years we have invested £168m in sport infrastructure - from grassroots to the elite performance which has increased the facilities and opportunities to get people active and achieve on the world stage at both the Olympics and Commonwealth Games.""",1,5,5
cohere_xlarge-20220609,Sheffield City Council has warned Green Party councillor Alison Teal that she will be taken to court if she continues to protest against the council's tree felling programme.,"Nether Edge Green Party councillor, Alison Teal, was served with a legal notice for her involvement in protests against Sheffield City Council's tree felling programme. Ms Teal was previously arrested for protesting against the tree removals. Charges against her and 13 others were dropped earlier this year. More stories from across Yorkshire Sheffield City Council maintain that the removal of street trees in the city is lawful and necessary. A ""pre-action protocol letter"" from the council's legal department to Ms Teal warned the authority will seek a High Court injunction to stop her, and others involved in ""direct action"", from taking part in future protests. The council said the process would give protesters ""a chance to further and finally consider their position"" before it begins legal proceedings on 12 July. Councillor Bryan Lodge, cabinet member for Environment and Street Scene, said there had been months of ""unlawful and costly disruption"" to tree replacement works in Sheffield by a small number of protesters. ""We continue to support the right to peacefully protest, and the majority of protesters who are doing so peacefully will not be affected,"" he added. ""But there is a big difference between this and direct action which deliberately and unlawfully stops works from being carried out."" Mr Lodge said protesters had been sent a letter several weeks ago confirming their actions were unlawful. ""Streets Ahead is not just about street trees, it's about ensuring we have roads, pavements and a street scene to be proud of for many years to come,"" he added. ""In addition, it presents us with a unique opportunity to sustainably manage, increase and maintain our diverse street tree stock over a 25 year period.""

cohere_xlarge-20220609,St Johnstone won 3-0 at Inverness to move five points clear of Hearts in the race for fourth place.,"Steven Maclean bundled home the opener five minutes before half-time. The hosts, slacker after the break, had beleaguered striker Larnell Cole sent-off after he confronted the referee. Liam Craig sealed the win from the penalty spot with two minutes to play, before Graham Cummins finished a sumptuous stoppage-time move. And things got worse still for Caley Thistle after the match, with captain Gary Warren shown a red card in the tunnel. Saints remain five points clear of Hearts in fourth place, and closed the gap on third-placed Rangers, who play Aberdeen on Sunday, to three points. With game after game ticking past, Inverness' position looks increasingly perilous. Next weekend's trip to Motherwell, second-bottom on goal difference, is now seismic. This contest turned nightmarish for the hosts after a bright opening, but the truth is, given their predicament, Caley Thistle did not threaten St Johnstone's goal enough. Billy Mckay sent a shot over from close range. Alex Fisher nodded a diving header wide. Carl Tremarco miscued a volley. Greg Tansey did draw a save from Alan Mannus when he rasped in an effort from outside the box, but Richie Foran's side never looked likely to find the net. Their best opportunity came immediately after the Saints went ahead, when Tansey fed Cole, who seemed to panic in a terrific position and shot straight at Mannus. Cole's dismissal ended the contest when he appeared to be cautioned twice for challenging referee Stephen Finnie's decision not to award a foul. St Johnstone were merciless and could have had more. With just one win from their last 21 league games, Inverness look deep in trouble. Tommy Wright's side deserve so much credit. Saints were tactically brilliant, so strong defensively and ruthlessly capitalised on their man advantage. They took one of their few first-half chances when Michael Coulson broke down the left and sent a dangerous ball across the six-yard box. Owain Fon Williams could only parry into the danger area, Cummins' shot was blocked but Maclean followed up to force it home. They should have had another when Craig's superb curling corner flew all the way to the back post where Cummins slid in and somehow knocked it over from two yards. Craig, in his 300th appearance for the club, coolly converted a spot-kick after Cummins was tripped to seal the points. Cummins then slammed home after Miller danced around the area to tee him up, before Craig cracked the bar amid the late flurry. With a tendency to finish the season strongly, and just a three-point gap to Rangers, the Perth side look capable of something special this term. Inverness CT manager Richie Foran: ""It is a tough time of the season to be sitting bottom, and I need real men to stand up to that, but not enough of them did that today. ""It is pure luck we are still in it and it is only four points. I sound like a broken record but one win changes it - that is the truth.

Following on, he then made 68 in Surrey's 166-3 to keep Hampshire at bay and prompt handshakes at 16:50 BST. The draw sees third-placed Hampshire claim 12 points, while Surrey take 10 points and stay sixth in Division One. Burns' epic effort saw him stay in the field for all but 10 overs of the entire match, as he defied Hampshire's bowling efforts on a flat Oval pitch. The left-hander was dropped twice in the slip cordon in his career-best 219, but was the only one to resist as Ian Holland (3-37) dismissed Tom Curran (53), Amar Virdi and Mark Footitt to force the follow-on after Surrey began the day on 410-7. Mark Stoneman (47) and Burns then put on an opening stand of 109 before Holland's medium pace had Stoneman lbw and Scott Borthwick bowled in a single over. Sean Ervine became the only man to dismiss Burns in 756 minutes of play when he missed a ball down the leg side, but Jason Roy and Dominic Sibley continued on until the conclusion. Surrey captain Rory Burns told BBC Radio London: ""I'm really pleased that we've fought that hard to get the draw and the extra five points, and obviously pretty happy with how I've played. ""We had to bat seven sessions to get us to safety and that's all I was thinking. ""There were some jitters in the nineties and I got a lifeline, which was quite nice. When I was getting close to 200, I was more thinking about the situation of getting to the follow-on mark. ""They're a good side and they played really well.

The council said it would bring staff in line with the other 17,000 workers and ""reduce the risk"" of staff making claims for equal pay. Union Unison said it was ""bitterly disappointed"" with the decision. Regional officer, Helen Metcalf, said: ""This is a devastating blow for the 2,700 teaching assistants in the county, who now face being driven into poverty and relying on food banks through losing Â£200 - Â£400 per month of their salary."" She said there was ""no option"" but to lodge a formal dispute and ballot members for industrial action. Teaching assistant Tony Lowery, said: ""It is really devastating for my family because I'm the main wager. I don't mean things like going on holidays or a second car, I mean things like food on the table and clothes on our backs."" Liberal Democrat councillors voted unanimously against the plans. Councillor Owen Temple said the affected staff would ""find themselves the poorest teaching assistants in the North East"" and the council was ""very likely to face legal challenge"". The council's corporate director of resources, Don McLure, said there was a ""real risk"" that, under the present contracts, other council employees could make claims for equal pay with the teaching assistants. He said: ""I fully understand the position teaching assistants are in but they are very valued, they do a great job and support the education of our children, but we are doing this to bring them in line with the rest of our workforce."" He said two consultations with assistants and the unions had failed to find agreement but it was hoped further discussions would resolve the matter without strike action being taken.",1,5,4

The City Deal scheme will see eight council areas around Glasgow receive about £1bn from the UK and Scottish governments. The councils also have the power to borrow extra cash. The Glasgow and Clyde Valley City Deal involved massive investment by both the Scottish and UK governments last year. Eight councils - Glasgow, East Renfrewshire, Renfrewshire, Inverclyde, North and South Lanarkshire and East and West Dunbartonshire - are involved. The City Deal scheme will see Westminster and Holyrood give £500m each in additional grant funding to the eight council areas. The councils will supplement this by borrowing £130m. Councillors from across all eight areas will meet to discuss some of the schemes. Several of the projects being discussed later are in East Renfrewshire, where £44m is expected to be invested over the next few years, with much of the money coming from the City Deal funding. One is a water sports park at the Dams to Darnley Country Park. It would open in 2017 and include a centre offering wakeboarding, the fastest-growing extreme sport in the world.

cohere_xlarge-20220609,The Scottish government will not implement a controversial child protection scheme until it has fixed problems highlighted by the UK's highest court.,"John Swinney will address MSPs over a legal challenge to information sharing proposals within the Act. The system would appoint a named person - usually a teacher or health visitor - to ensure the wellbeing of every child. But judges at the UK's highest court ruled against the scheme in July 2016, citing concerns over information sharing. The Supreme Court judges said some proposals breached rights to privacy and a family life under the European Convention on Human Rights. However, the court said the aim of the Act, which is intended to promote and safeguard the rights and wellbeing of children and young people, was legitimate. Speaking ahead of his statement to the Scottish Parliament, Mr Swinney said the Scottish government remained ""absolutely committed"" to the Named Person service as a way to support children and their families. ""Last year the Supreme Court ruled definitively that the intention of providing a Named Person for every child to promote and safeguard their wellbeing was 'unquestionably legitimate and benign',"" he said. ""Their judgement did, however, require us to change the provisions relating to information sharing. ""Since the judgement, we have undertaken an intensive period of engagement with children, young people, parents, carers, practitioners and professionals. ""I will now update parliament on the next steps in this vital means of supporting, safeguarding and promoting the wellbeing of our children and young people."" The judges said in July that specific proposals about information-sharing were ""not within the legislative competence of the Scottish Parliament"". And they said the legislation made it ""perfectly possible"" that confidential information about a young person could be disclosed to a ""wide range of public authorities without either the child or young person or her parents being aware"".

cohere_xlarge-20220609,The Supreme Court has ruled that tax subsidies that make health insurance affordable for low-income individuals can continue.,"In a 6-3 decision, the justices said that tax subsidies that make health insurance affordable for low-income individuals can continue. The ruling preserves the law known as Obamacare, which Mr Obama considers a major part of his presidential legacy. Republicans have vowed to continue fighting the law. ""We've got more work to do, but what we're not going to do is unravel what has now been woven into the fabric of America,"" Mr Obama said. The case, known as King v Burwell, was the second major challenge the law has faced in the US's highest court. Unlike in many other western countries, the US does not have a single-payer healthcare system. Private companies, rather than the US government, provide health insurance for US citizens. The enactment of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) - one of Mr Obama's most significant and controversial domestic achievements - in 2010 mandated that every American had to purchase private insurance. It provided the subsidies to allow many to do so. In 2012, the mandate portion of the law was challenged in the court. The justices ruled to preserve it. In that decision, as in the decision on Thursday, Chief Justice John Roberts surprised observers by siding with his liberal colleagues in support of the law. ""Congress passed the Affordable Care act to improve health insurance markets, not to destroy them,"" Chief Justice John Roberts wrote in the opinion. Justice Anthony Kennedy dissented in 2012, but sided with the majority on Thursday. Had the court made the opposite decision, an estimated 8.7 million people in the US would have been at risk of losing the aid that makes healthcare affordable. The stakes could not have been higher. People's health (crucially important) and Obama's legacy (less important, but for him and those around him fairly vital) were at stake. Well a politically finely balanced Supreme Court has given an emphatic, overwhelming vote in favour of the president by 6-3. I bet ""No-drama Obama"" is high-fiving anyone and everyone in the White House - that is how big it is. Obama defies lame-duck expectations Demonstrators gathered outside the court as early on Thursday morning. Reading updates on their mobile phones, the crowd became jubilant when they learned mid-morning that the court had ruled in their favour. Some began dancing, while others chanted ""If you're covered and you know it clap your hands."" ""This is a big sigh of relief for millions across the country,"" said Ron Pollack of Families USA, a health-care advocacy organisation. ""The ACA is not just the law of the land, it will remain the law of the land"". ""Today is a good day for healthcare in America,"" said activist Benton Strong. ""I hope this is the end of the line."" Demonstrators opposing the subsidies did not have a large visible presence. Justice Antonin Scalia wrote in his dissent that the Supreme Court is setting a precedent of favouring some laws over others. ""We should start calling this law Scotuscare"" Justice Scalia wrote, referring to the court's acronym. ""Today's interpretation is not merely unnatural; it is unheard",1,5,5
cohere_xlarge-20220609,"The Welsh Conservatives have been given a huge confidence boost and will feel in a position to challenge in more constituencies next year, rather than just on the list.","The Conservatives have been given a huge confidence boost and will feel in a position to challenge in more constituencies next year, rather than just on the list. At the party's weekly press briefing, I asked the Welsh Conservative leader Andrew RT Davies, who was elected on the list, whether he'd stand as a constituency candidate in his home turf of the Vale of Glamorgan but he said he hadn't thought about it. Presumably those are the kind of decisions they will now feel more confident contemplating. The party will also have a huge amount of new data on voters which it'll be able to call upon and the belief that campaigning hard on the NHS helped the Tories cross the line in places like the Vale of Clwyd and Gower. The Conservatives feel it's them, rather than any of the other opposition parties, who have become the repository of votes from those who are disaffected by the state of the NHS. Welsh Labour are going to hold a ""short sharp"" analysis into what went wrong. Carwyn Jones was in line with most of the criticism of Ed Miliband when he told AMs that the party needed to appeal to small business owners who are not millionaires but who work hard. What will be more difficult is countering the argument on the NHS, which the former minister Alun Davies believes is already lost. Another potential difficulty for Welsh Labour will be dealing with unhappiness within the party over council re-organisation. Bernie Attridge, the deputy leader of Flintshire Council, has tweeted saying the party needs to be careful on local government reform if it wants to retain the support of grassroots councillors. It also seems to have been the case that Labour lost more votes to UKIP than the Conservatives, which is another challenge to overcome. But Labour will at least have the advantage that it will be David Cameron, and not Ed Miliband, carrying out the latest round of public sector cuts that are likely to take effect sooner rather than later. The question is whether Carwyn Jones is going to be able to turn that to his advantage when his own record in government will be under scrutiny. Plaid Cymru's education spokesman, Simon Thomas, also in the party's weekly press briefing, said he believed Leanne Wood could portray herself as an alternative first minister because of the way she emotionally connected with people in the campaign. The party now has a year to make that a credible proposition after it failed to gain any new seats and came fourth, behind UKIP, in the overall share of the vote, despite her unprecedented profile. He also said that on the campaign trail people wanted to know what Plaid was going to do about the NHS and that people ""did not see the strengths"" of its arguments. The Welsh Liberal Democrats are still licking their wounds but in a ""je ne regrette rien"" moment, the leader Kirsty Williams said she had no regrets over the coalition. She has admitted the party failed to communicate",1,4,4

He said he would now look at the 125 existing marine protected areas to see if further improvements could be made. The Marine Conservation Society (MCS) described it as an ""embarrassing U-turn"" for the Welsh government, and has called for better protection of seas. Creating the zones would mean a ban on fishing and anchoring in some areas and had brought opposition. The Welsh Fishermen's Association said previously that existing conservation networks for Welsh waters are adequate. The Welsh government proposed the zones last year with the backing of the Countryside Council of Wales and the Marine Conservation Society. The minister for natural resources said the decision had been made after the thousands of responses to the consultation brought ""divergent and strongly held views"". Mr Davies said to ""avoid any continuing uncertainty over the options presented in the 2012 consultation, I am also withdrawing all the proposed sites"". His comments come after the findings were published of a task and finish team which reviewed the feedback. Now, he will concentrate on the existing 125 Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) that cover 36% of Welsh seas to see if any changes can be made rather than creating additional zones. ""We are now in a stronger position to assess our current contribution to the network's ecological coherence,"" he said. ""I have, therefore, commissioned an assessment of our current MPAs to identify if there are any gaps and what the options might be to fill those gaps. ""If any measures are required, I believe they should be simple, proportionate and fit for purpose."" Dr Peter Richardson, biodiversity programme manager for MCS, said the Welsh government ""spent an awful lot of time and money and encouraged other people to put effort into this consultation response"". He said: ""70% of the consultation responses were in favour of designating these sites and yet today the minister has announced he's scrapping the whole thing... bit of an embarrassing U-turn for the government I think."" He added: ""I think there are plenty of people in the fishing industry... that understand that in order to get the best yields from the marine habitats on which they depend, they have to be managed properly.""",1,5,5

The council's head of neighbourhood and strategic housing, Kristine Reeves, was later sacked over the affair. The development proposals, put forward by Norwich City Council, include 60 flats and 45 houses. The report to the council says 35 of the houses and flats will be for social rent. A report to Norwich City Council's planning committee, which meets on Thursday, advises councillors to approve the plans. Elderly residents were moved out of Greyhound Opening and nearby Goldsmith Street seven years ago after Norwich City Council agreed to redevelop the site. The council agreed that new employees relocating to the city could move in temporarily ahead of demolition. However other staff, including Ms Reeves, also moved in, in contravention of council policy. The council resisted calls for a full independent inquiry. Its own investigation found safeguards covering conflicts of interest were in place but not followed. In February 2009, London-based architects Riches Hawley Mikhail won a competition to design a new social housing development on the site, but they were never commissioned. During that year homes on the derelict site were demolished, but the site has since remained untouched.",1,5,4

However, the council is now paying Â£450 to fill it up again, so that the town looks its best for key 2012 events. It will be working on the 4 and 5 June and when the Olympic torch relay passes through the borough on 8 July. The fountain on Parkway in the town was built to celebrate the Queen's accession to the throne in 1952. It is supplied by an underground tank, but had to be switched off after the water level dropped and could not be refilled. The council is buying water from a landscaping firm which already supplies water from a natural lake source, to maintain the borough's open spaces. It cannot be drunk so is permitted under the hosepipe ban regulations. Council chief executive, Michel Saminaden, said: ""They have told us that there is an abundance of water in this lake so we are probably doing them a favour by taking it."" Mr Saminaden added that the council decided against asking the Veolia water company for a special dispensation. ""I thought that wasn't the right thing to do because we would be using precious water,"" he said. ""What we are doing now is using water that is surplus and we have been told categorically that there is no problem in using it. This is a better all round sustainable solution. ""I am extremely pleased that we have been able to find a solution which will enable everybody to see the fountain in all its glory on the occasion of these two great celebrations.""",1,5,4

Senior coroner John Leckey is retiring this year and told a preliminary hearing of the inquest in Belfast that no replacement has been appointed. His retirement could leave only one coroner in Northern Ireland. Kingsmill is among dozens of inquests dating from the early days of the Troubles that face delay because not enough money is available to investigate or there is nobody to oversee fresh hearings. Mr Leckey said: ""I feel for the bereaved families, not exclusively Kingsmill but for other inquests I am involved in. ""It is a disappointment that is widespread."" A lawyer for some of the Kingsmill victims' families said they would be pressing Stormont's justice department for more resources to allow an inquest to go ahead. Karen Armstrong, a sister of one of the murdered men, said the lack of resources was ""a political problem"". ""We are not going to lie down and accept it,"" she said. ""We will fight until we get another date and they have to make sure there are enough coroners in Northern Ireland to deal with our and many other cases."" Ulster Unionist MLA Danny Kennedy said he would be asking Justice Minister David Ford to ensure the matter was referred to the relevant authorities so that ""action can be taken as soon as possible"". ""Justice has been denied for almost 40 years and it is totally unacceptable that this inquest should be delayed further due to the unavailability of a coroner,"" he said. ""This was one of the most shocking and cruel events of the Troubles and the inquest must be treated with the seriousness this crime merits."" A Department of Justice spokesman said: ""Officials are actively working to ensure that all necessary resources are provided for the conduct of inquests in Northern Ireland. ""There are currently three full-time coroners in Northern Ireland. In addition, one High Court judge and one County Court judge have also been appointed as coroners.""",0,5,4

She will take on a new role on the clinic's Northern Ireland advisory board. Last November, anti-abortion protester Bernadette Smyth, who leads the Precious Life group, was convicted of harassing Ms Purvis at the Marie Stopes office in Belfast city centre. Ms Purvis told the BBC that had had no influence on her decision to step down. ""I think the clinic's well established here now, we're providing services more and more every year and I'm delighted to be remaining on the advisory board for the clinic. ""But I feel it's time to move on and I think it's time for Marie Stopes to get someone else in to manage the clinic and take it to new places,"" she said. ""At times it was difficult, particularly last year with the court case and the harassment, but I put that behind me and have concentrated on delivering services for women in Ireland both north and south. ""I think I've achieved a significant historical change in the perception of abortion in Northern Ireland from where the usual narrative was that abortion was illegal in Northern Ireland to now one where people understand that abortion is legal under certain circumstances. ""I think we've challenged the myths and stereotypes that are presented by those who are opposed to a woman's right to chose."" Genevieve Edwards, director of policy for Marie Stopes UK, said: ""We were so lucky to have Dawn and wish her every success in whatever she chooses to do.

The couple spoke out in response to consultation on proposed reform of sentencing for driving offences. They believe increased sentences should be backed up by manslaughter charges. Mr Moores, 28, was killed by a Vauxhall Astra driven by Donna Hackett on the M4 near Swindon. Hackett, then aged 26, fled and was found by police asleep in a ditch. She served half of a six-year jail term after she was found guilty of causing death by careless driving while drunk. The Ministry of Justice consultation suggests offenders who cause death by careless driving while under the influence of drink or drugs could soon be handed a life sentence - an increase on the current 14-year upper limit. Source: Crown Prosecution Service But Mr and Mrs Moores, from Chandlers Ford, Hampshire, also want the offence to be upgraded to a charge of manslaughter. Mr Moores said: ""Somebody can drive drunk and kill my son. Why is that not manslaughter? ""Nothing can prepare a parent for seeing their child in the mortuary. That will stay with me every day, every day that vision comes into my mind. ""Our life is ruined."" Mrs Moores added: ""There's nothing careless about drink driving. I don't want anybody else to feel like us."" Ms Hackett, who lived in Radnor Street, Swindon, at the time of the offence, appealed against her sentence in September 2011, but was refused. A Ministry of Justice spokesperson said: ""We are determined to make sure those who kill whilst driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs face the full force of the law. ""That is why we are consulting on plans that will see the maximum sentence for a number of offences in this area increase from 14 years to life.""

Since then, efforts have been continuing to rescue it from closure and save the jobs of its 11,000 staff. Last week, a surprise late bid led by retail veteran Greg Tufnell transformed the race to acquire the retailer. His team, said to be backed by Portuguese money, is the front-runner. But if a deal cannot be struck, the business may still have to be liquidated. The remaining bidders have faded into the background. Another consortium led by Matalan tycoon John Hargreaves and Turkish retail entrepreneur Cafer Mahiroglu has reportedly run into difficulties, while other suitors have apparently failed to impress with their proposals. Some of those involved in the different bids have impressive retailing histories. But then Sir Philip Green, who controlled BHS from 2000 to 2015, also had a brilliant track record. And he ended up selling the business for Â£1. So what are the chances of saving BHS from the liquidators? And just who are the people aiming to do it? In the public eye, Greg Tufnell is easily overshadowed by his more famous brother Phil, the former England cricketer. But that could change if his bid for BHS is successful, because he hopes to become the firm's next chairman. And as far as his credentials for the job are concerned, the 54-year-old executive certainly talks the talk. He describes himself as ""a highly experienced managing director with Mothercare and Arcadia, a blend of entrepreneur, strategist and hands-on operator with significant commercial business turnaround, acquisition and fund-raising experience"". His record shows that he was buying and merchandising director at Next from 1991 to 1994. He then spent three years as managing director of menswear retailer Burton, part of the Arcadia group, followed by another three years as managing director of Mothercare. He currently appears to occupy a portfolio of different jobs, including the chairmanships of leather accessories brand Zatchels and recruitment consultancy hga Group. Earlier this month, he registered a new firm, Richess Group, at Companies House. Its other directors are Nick de Scossa, a Swiss banker, and Lisbon-based entrepreneur Jose Maria Soares Bento. Until Mr Tufnell's bid turned up, many observers had assumed that BHS would be snapped up by Matalan founder Mr Hargreaves. But it appears that the cost of a deal may have proved too high. Sources say Mr Hargreaves was asked to improve his offer and balked. Like Sir Philip Green, 71-year-old John Hargreaves also enjoys the life of the super-rich. He has an estimated fortune of Â£1bn, according to the Sunday Times Rich List. But in stark contrast to the ebullient Sir Philip, Mr Hargreaves is described by industry insiders as quiet-spoken, someone who shuns the limelight. Mr Hargreaves is no longer directly involved in the business he founded. He sold his 69% stake in Matalan in 2000, then in 2006 took it private through Missouri Bidco, a company 53.5% owned by him and his family. As a partner in Mr Hargreaves' bid, there is also Cafer Mahiroglu, the owner of Select Fashions. At 50, he is the youngest of",0,5,4
cohere_xlarge-20220609,Three British teenagers have been arrested in Turkey after trying to cross into Syria.,"The group, reported to be three men, two women and four children aged from two to 11, was held at Reyhanli, in Hatay province, near the Syrian border. Their intention in travelling to the region, where areas are controlled by Islamic State (IS) militants or an al-Qaeda affiliate, is not clear. The Foreign Office has said it is in contact with the Turkish authorities. The BBC's Mark Lowen said the information about the ages of the children had not been independently verified and it was too early to know where the group were intending to head to. ""Were they heading for one of the more moderate groups in Syria. Were they heading for the area controlled by al-Nusra, the al-Qaeda affiliate? Or were they heading to so-called Islamic State territory?"" he said. The group was taken to a police station in southern Turkey overnight, and then sent to the foreigners department awaiting deportation to the UK. They have undergone medical examinations and had their finger-prints taken. The United Nations estimates the number of foreign fighters joining militant groups is more than 25,000, from 100 different nations. About 600 Britons are believed to have gone to Syria or Iraq since IS seized control of large swathes of territory there. Most are thought to have volunteered as fighters for the militant Islamist group. Around half are believed to have later returned to the UK, the Metropolitan Police has said. The latest detentions come two weeks after three British teenagers were stopped from travelling into Syria from Turkey. The three - two aged 17 and one 19, from north-west London - were arrested following a tip-off from British police and flown back to the UK. They have since been released on police bail. They had flown to Turkey from Barcelona and were arrested at Sabiha Gokcen airport in Istanbul. Fadi Hakura, Turkey analyst for Chatham House, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the recent arrests showed the Turkish government was ""taking more effective measures to control the flow of fighters and supporters into Syria"". He said there was now ""more enhanced security and intelligence cooperation between Turkey and its Western counterparts, especially with the exchange of names that Turkey needs to prohibit [IS supporters] from crossing into Syria"". The Turkish government has said it cannot make a 560-mile border watertight and will act when it has prior warning. In February this year there were recriminations between British police and Turkish officials after three London schoolgirls disappeared from Turkey, apparently having crossed the border into Syria.

Wrockwardine Wood and Sutherland academies, also run by the Telford Co-operative Multi-Academy Trust, were put in special measures earlier this week. The trust has not commented. Ofsted criticised the trust's lack of support to the schools and said each was now considering an alternative sponsor. Inspectors said pupils' achievement at the Phoenix Academy had dropped since it became an academy in 2013 and their latest report rated it inadequate in all areas. A report in 2013, before it converted, rated the secondary school as ""requiring improvement"", while Lakeside was rated ""good"" in 2012 under its former name the Lord Silkin School. In the latest report, inspectors said the curriculum at Phoenix Academy was ""inadequate"", while ""weak teaching"" meant pupils were not sufficiently challenged and were often ""disengaged and disruptive"". There was particular criticism of standards in English and maths which the watchdog said were limiting pupils' achievements in other areas. Ofsted's report said governors, managers and teachers had developed a ""culture of low expectations"", while leaders had failed to act decisively to halt the decline in pupils' achievement. There was, however, some praise for the acting head teacher. Inspectors said he had introduced a number of improvement measures and some were ""beginning to have an impact"". A report on Lakeside School highlighted similar concerns, criticising teachers for not sufficiently challenging pupils and for having ""over generous"" predictions of their achievement. Inspectors said many pupils, whether high achievers or those with special educational needs, were ""not making the progress they should"" and achievements at GCSE were well below the national average. Governors were also criticised for not holding leaders to account, while the report said management had failed to effectively monitor either pupils or teachers.

A reading below 50 indicates falling output. It is the first time that activity in the sector has fallen since March 2013. Firms blamed soft domestic demand, a fall in new business from overseas and uncertainty ahead of the EU referendum. A slowdown in the oil and gas industry, a major customer for UK companies, is also hitting production. The index for new orders fell to 50.4 in April, from 51.9 the month before, matching February's three-year low. Rob Dobson, senior economist at Markit, said: ""On this evidence manufacturing production is now falling at a quarterly pace of around 1%, and will likely act as a drag on the economy again during the second quarter and putting greater pressure on the service sector to sustain GDP growth. ""The manufacturing labour market is also being impacted, with the data signalling close to 20,000 job losses over the past three months."" Last week, official figures showed UK economic growth slowed to 0.4% in the first quarter of the year from 0.6% in late 2015, propped up by the services sector. David Noble, group chief executive at the Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply (CIPS), said: ""Recent fears over a stall in the UK's manufacturing sector have now become a reality. ""An atmosphere of deep unease is building throughout the manufacturing supply chain, eating away at new orders, reducing British exports and putting more jobs at risk. ""A sense of apprehension across the sector is being caused by enduring volatility in the oil and gas industry, falling retailer confidence and the uncertainty created by the EU referendum."" The Markit/CIPS survey found new export orders contracted for the fourth straight month in April as the global economy continued to slow. A measure of employment in the manufacturing sector was also below the 50 mark for its fourth straight month. Lee Hopley, chief economist at the manufacturers' organisation, EEF, said: ""The sharp drop to a three-year low and another month of reported job cuts could be the clearest sign yet that referendum uncertainty is starting to weigh on the real economy. ""However, this is just another straw on the back of a sector already grappling with the struggling oil and gas sector, softening domestic demand and weak order outlook from other parts of the world, all of which are failing to provide any counterbalance to the political uncertainty at home.""",0,4,4

The ruling NEC body discussed the issue at a meeting on Friday, where they also decided to allow a controversial anti-Islam campaigner to run for the UKIP leadership. Mr Oakden said: ""A member of the NEC had contacted the person that is putting this forward and said to them they need to follow the proper process of completing the necessary forms and submitting them to the NEC.

""Her lack of effort in pursuing the aims of the party both locally and nationally is of concern to members across the region."" Mr Owen added he believed members would stop supporting UKIP if Ms Brown remained in the role. However, a spokesman for the party's assembly group dismissed the letter as written by a ""tiny and insignificant group"". In February, Ms Brown denied an allegation she had smoked recreational drugs in a hotel room.

5.","GP practices are being paid to help local NHS groups limit the number of patient referrals and cut costs, the doctors' magazine Pulse found. Appointments affected include scans and consultations with specialists - including those for cancer patients. The British Medical Association said such incentives were ""misguided"". At least nine clinical commissioning groups (CCGs) were offering GP practices payments for hitting targets, according to Pulse's investigation. In one case, Birmingham South Central CCG was offering practices more than Â£11,000 to reduce new outpatient attendances, follow-ups, A&E attendances and emergency admissions by 1%, compared with 2014/15. It said the schemes, which exclude cancer referrals, were designed to ""incentivise best quality practice"" and ""drive improvements in the quality of primary medical care"". ""Our priority is to ensure that patients have access to services that they need, when they need them,"" said a spokesperson for Birmingham South Central CCG. Another CCG told Pulse it had considered the ""full impact"" of the incentive scheme and was ""confident that there is no conflict of interest"". Pulse said that one scheme had already been looked at by the General Medical Council, the body which regulates medical standards in the UK, after local GP leaders expressed their concern. The magazine pointed out that initial hospital referrals for cancer patients should happen within two weeks of a GP first suspecting the condition. Dr Chand Nagpaul, chairman of the GPs committee of the doctors' trade union the British Medical Association, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that such schemes were a ""financial contaminant"" to patient-doctor trust. He said: ""It's short-sighted and misguided of CCGs to introduce such mechanisms, because they do lead to the potential for patients questioning the motives of GP referrals. ""We believe it is far more appropriate for CCGs to introduce clinical pathways that ensure patients are referred appropriately rather than these crude, salesman-like bonuses which pay GPs simply to make reduction to referrals in numerical terms."" Dr Peter Melton is local GP and clinical chief officer for North East Lincolnshire CCG, which offers the equivalent of more than Â£6,000 to practices that reduce outpatient referrals to the same level as the 25% with the lowest referral rates (which include two-week urgent cancer referrals) in 2014/15. He said the CCG was already among the best in England for referring suspected cancer patients to a consultant within two weeks and the scheme was not about avoiding sending people to hospital. ""It is not focussing on referral reduction per se but on better clinical and quality standards for the patient,"" he explained. ""The expectation is practices will be encouraged to investigate more locally and monitor the patient in the first instance rather than automatically refer in to a secondary care service.""

4. He was a","His previous jobs were at Celtic and Bolton, but moving to the second tier of Scottish football was no hindrance to him returning to work at Easter Road. Lennon saw the vacancy as an opportunity, and that was enough to encourage Hibs that a figure of his profile and experience would accept a role in the Championship. Even though his last job in Scotland involved leading a team on Champions League duty, Lennon's mind has not been swayed by haughtiness. The appointment of the former Celtic manager as successor to Alan Stubbs suits both parties, because it is mutually beneficial. Success is alluring, and Hibs offer Lennon the chance to accumulate more achievements. He was immediately engaged in crisis management at his previous club Bolton, but will find stability, potential and accomplishment at Easter Road. The demand will be to deliver promotion, but that will not seem daunting when the majority of the squad that pushed Rangers for a while last season then won the Scottish Cup is still in place. Lennon's task is to refine and bolster the team, when new managers are often faced with a period of overhaul. Stubbs left the club on an emotional high after delivering their first Scottish Cup in 114 years, but before the final against Rangers there was a tangible sense of exasperation that promotion had been missed. Hibs were entitled to feel that it was an unnecessary failure given their circumstances. The club is about to embark on a third season in the Championship, but by most other measures they can be considered a top-flight outfit. The budget will be significantly more than the rest of the teams in the division, the training ground at East Mains and facilities are first-class, the football side of the business is stable and well-run by George Craig, the club's head of football operations, the squad is full of talent. Lennon can rely on consistently assured performances from the likes of David Gray, Darren McGregor, Paul Hanlon, Lewis Stevenson, John McGinn, Fraser Fyvie, Dylan McGeouch, James Keatings and Jason Cummings. Some minor issues remain, such as who will fill the goal next season, but the challenge is more on adding depth and strength of will to the squad and man-management. McGinn, one of the most reliably effective players in the Championship last season, has already insisted that he remains committed to Hibs despite the failure to achieve promotion. The 21-year-old midfielder provides the kind of industry and spirit that a team can be built around. There may be critical decisions to make, though, since Cummings is entering the final year of his contract and so represents a sellable asset. He is a regular goalscorer, though, and Stubbs had to sign Anthony Stokes on loan last January to provide some support up front. These are tweaks compared to the amount of work Stubbs had to carry out when he was appointed two years ago. Hibs are ready to be guided forward, not waiting to be rescued.

At the party's weekly press briefing, I asked the Welsh Conservative leader Andrew RT Davies, who was elected on the list, whether he'd stand as a constituency candidate in his home turf of the Vale of Glamorgan but he said he hadn't thought about it. Presumably those are the kind of decisions they will now feel more confident contemplating. The party will also have a huge amount of new data on voters which it'll be able to call upon and the belief that campaigning hard on the NHS helped the Tories cross the line in places like the Vale of Clwyd and Gower. The Conservatives feel it's them, rather than any of the other opposition parties, who have become the repository of votes from those who are disaffected by the state of the NHS. Welsh Labour are going to hold a ""short sharp"" analysis into what went wrong. Carwyn Jones was in line with most of the criticism of Ed Miliband when he told AMs that the party needed to appeal to small business owners who are not millionaires but who work hard. What will be more difficult is countering the argument on the NHS, which the former minister Alun Davies believes is already lost. Another potential difficulty for Welsh Labour will be dealing with unhappiness within the party over council re-organisation. Bernie Attridge, the deputy leader of Flintshire Council, has tweeted saying the party needs to be careful on local government reform if it wants to retain the support of grassroots councillors. It also seems to have been the case that Labour lost more votes to UKIP than the Conservatives, which is another challenge to overcome. But Labour will at least have the advantage that it will be David Cameron, and not Ed Miliband, carrying out the latest round of public sector cuts that are likely to take effect sooner rather than later. The question is whether Carwyn Jones is going to be able to turn that to his advantage when his own record in government will be under scrutiny. Plaid Cymru's education spokesman, Simon Thomas, also in the party's weekly press briefing, said he believed Leanne Wood could portray herself as an alternative first minister because of the way she emotionally connected with people in the campaign. The party now has a year to make that a credible proposition after it failed to gain any new seats and came fourth, behind UKIP, in the overall share of the vote, despite her unprecedented profile. He also said that on the campaign trail people wanted to know what Plaid was going to do about the NHS and that people ""did not see the strengths"" of its arguments.

It's full of light. It's busy. The building has regenerated the area around Melton Mowbray's railway station, once a muddy pot-holed piece of wasteland where those in the know parked for free. Now the council offices link the station to a park and the town centre. It was partly paid for with insurance money after a fire destroyed the old offices on the other side of town. A supermarket moved in to replace it and helped with the money too, putting the council on a firm financial footing. But that was four years ago and the crisis is a different one today. It's being experienced by all local authorities - cuts in central government funding which threaten the services they provide. Mr Rhodes is also deputy leader of Leicestershire County Council, with responsibility for finance. Leicestershire is historically the poorest funded council in the country because of a quirk of Whitehall recalculations, going back a quarter of a century since the poll tax, or community charge, was scrapped. At the moment councils get income from council tax, a share of the business rates, any income they generate themselves from services plus a grant from central government. It's the grant cut which is causing them grief. What's called the ""core funding"" is worked out by the number of homes multiplied by a set amount. And each authority has a different value set per dwelling. If we look at Surrey, which is top of the table, the amount will be £1,686 by 2019/20. Nottinghamshire is mid-table at £1,482, Derbyshire is in the lower reaches with £1,422 per dwelling and then comes Leicestershire at £1,354. ""The funding system is chaotic,"" says Byron Rhodes. ""It doesn't reflect real need. Look at Oxfordshire which is an interesting example,"" he says with a glint in his eye. Could he possibly be referring to the prime ministerial plea to the county council about cutbacks to services there? ""If we had the same funding as Oxfordshire, we'd have £50m a year extra. If we had the same as Surrey, we'd have £100m more. We'd be partying everyday if we had that kind of money."" Leicestershire have been helped with a small share of what's been called transitional funding - about £300m to help councils following pressure from Conservative MPs. Think back to the vote on Sunday trading. With a majority of only 17 in the Commons, the Conservatives lost the vote when 20 odd rebelled. Last month there would've been another rebellion, including some of our own Tory MPs in the East Midlands, if something wasn't done to improve the local government finance settlement over the next four years. The money has gone largely to shire counties. Leicestershire got £6.6m spread over two years, enough to save some services from closure. But it's a drop in the ocean for an authority with a £19m black hole in the budget every year after the latest cutbacks. Labour have protested that 83% of the councils getting transition funding are Conservative-run. Many Labour-run",0,2,2

Uhuru Kenyatta, who faces trial at the International Criminal Court, has been leading in early presidential results declared from Monday's tightly contested election. He is due to stand trial at The Hague next month for allegedly fuelling violence after the disputed 2007 election. He denies the charge. His closest rival is outgoing Prime Minister Raila Odinga. With provisional results in from more than 40% of polling stations earlier on Wednesday, Mr Odinga had 42% of the vote compared with Mr Kenyatta's 53%. However, Mr Odinga's allies remain confident that he will gain ground as results from his strongholds, including the Coast Province, are declared. More than 1,000 people were killed in the violence which broke out in 2007-08 after Mr Odinga claimed he had been cheated of victory by supporters of President Mwai Kibaki, who is stepping down after two terms in office. The BBC's Solomon Mugera in the capital, Nairobi, says Kenyans are becoming increasingly anxious about the delay in finalising the results. Some businesses and schools across the country have remained shut since Monday's election, he says. This has led to a shortage of goods, pushing up the prices of basic foodstuff in areas such as Kibera, the biggest slum in Nairobi and a stronghold of Mr Odinga, our correspondent adds.

At about 13:00 local time, returning officers from only 53 of the 290 constituencies had arrived and the election commission said it would announce results from constituencies as they were ready. Its website had stopped giving updated results from the presidential race on Wednesday, and was still showing figures from Tuesday night. Our correspondent says the large number of spoiled ballots - about 6% of the total vote, well over double the number of votes cast for the third-placed candidate, Musailia Mudavadi - has become a major bone of contention.

The City Deal scheme will see eight council areas around Glasgow receive about £1bn from the UK and Scottish governments. The councils also have the power to borrow extra cash. The Glasgow and Clyde Valley City Deal involved massive investment by both the Scottish and UK governments last year. Eight councils - Glasgow, East Renfrewshire, Renfrewshire, Inverclyde, North and South Lanarkshire and East and West Dunbartonshire - are involved. The City Deal scheme will see Westminster and Holyrood give £500m each in additional grant funding to the eight council areas. The councils will supplement this by borrowing £130m. Councillors from across all eight areas will meet to discuss some of the schemes. Several of the projects being discussed later are in East Renfrewshire, where £44m is expected to be invested over the next few years, with much of the money coming from the City Deal funding. One is a water sports park at the Dams to Darnley Country Park. It would open in 2017 and include a centre offering wakeboarding, the fastest-growing extreme sport in the world. A new railway station in Barrhead and sliproad from the M77 would serve an area which could become one of East Renfrewshire's fastest growth areas. The council expects 1,000 new homes to be built there. Another project would transform the Levern Works site in Barrhead. A site formerly occupied by Nestle, where pet food was once made, would be cleared. The site will then be marketed for development for a range of uses that will bring new jobs to Barrhead. A wide range of other infrastructure projects across the eight council areas will also be discussed.",0,2,1

The cuts are being blamed on reduced government spending and a drop in National Lottery ticket sales - a major contributor to sports backing. Governing bodies are bracing themselves for potential job losses. About 60% of funding is made up from Scottish Government money, with lottery sales making up the rest. In the year ending 2015, total revenue was £65.1m, which is divided up and awarded to 52 sports. By the end of next year, that figure will have fallen to £51.8m - a cut to the Scottish sporting budget of 20% in just three years. sportscotland chairman Mel Young said: ""It's heartbreaking to me because I know the effort the sport governing bodies and the community that's around it; the volunteers and the mums and dads. ""And, to have to say that we're having to cut some money back is, I believe, not the right way to go."" Former badminton player Susan Egelstaff, a double bronze medallist at the Commonwealth Games [in 2002 and 2006] and an Olympian, fears the cuts will have ""a huge impact"". ""What that means in the future is that Scotland will be constantly playing catch-up,"" she said. ""It's almost impossible to catch up if you fall too far behind the leading nations."" The Scottish Government said sport and physical activity play a ""key role"" in a healthy Scotland and that ""significant"" investment would continue in those areas. ""Having successfully delivered the Commonwealth Games [in 2014] we are now focusing on protecting or raising investment in areas intended to decrease health inequality and improve life chances, and the small reduction in the sport budget allows us to support those priorities,"" Minister for Sport Aileen Campbell said. ""There is on-going support for active lifestyles through capital investment in cycling and walking, and over the last 10 years we have invested £168m in sport infrastructure - from grassroots to the elite performance which has increased the facilities and opportunities to get people active and achieve on the world stage at both the Olympics and Commonwealth Games.""",0,2,1

It was sent to UKIP's national executive committee (NEC) before a row over racial slurs about a Labour MP, for which Ms Brown apologised. But UKIP chairman Paul Oakden said the letter did not follow proper process. A UKIP assembly group spokesman said the letter was written by a group with a ""long-standing grudge"" against the AM. The ruling NEC body discussed the issue at a meeting on Friday, where they also decided to allow a controversial anti-Islam campaigner to run for the UKIP leadership. Mr Oakden said: ""A member of the NEC had contacted the person that is putting this forward and said to them they need to follow the proper process of completing the necessary forms and submitting them to the NEC. ""Members simply emailing the NEC saying we want you to do this is not the correct disciplinary process for the party, by any stretch of the imagination. ""A member of the NEC has gone back and given advice on what they need to do."" Shaun Owen, secretary of UKIP's Delyn branch, wrote to the NEC saying: ""For some time we have been appalled by the abrasive and discourteous manner of Ms Brown towards UKIP locally. ""Her lack of effort in pursuing the aims of the party both locally and nationally is of concern to members across the region."" Mr Owen added he believed members would stop supporting UKIP if Ms Brown remained in the role. However, a spokesman for the party's assembly group dismissed the letter as written by a ""tiny and insignificant group"". In February, Ms Brown denied an allegation she had smoked recreational drugs in a hotel room. Later that month, she said she had acted ""with propriety"" after it was revealed she had discussed how an advert for a job in her assembly office could be changed to help her brother get an interview for the post. Meanwhile, UKIP's NEC confirmed that 11 hopefuls in the contest to succeed Paul Nuttall as leader will be able to run as candidates. The list includes Anne Marie Waters, the founder of the Sharia Watch pressure group, who has described Islam as evil. UKIP AM David Rowlands had said Ms Waters is probably ""too extreme"" to be allowed to stand but she claimed the party was trying to ""ostracise"" her. Other candidates who have also cleared the NEC's vetting process and are going forward to a vote of the membership include Welsh activist John Rees-Evans, London Assembly member Peter Whittle and Scottish MEP David Coburn.

Freezing care provider fees to save money was no long sustainable, it said. Ministers say extra money will help NHS and social care services work together. The survey, which was completed by 147 directors of adult social services for councils in England, suggests that funding reductions to social care budgets have totalled £4.6bn since 2010 - a 31% overall reduction. Budgets for adult social care - which provides practical support to people due to illness, disability, old age or a low income - will reduce by a further £500m in cash terms this year, it said. ""Taking the growth in numbers of older and disabled people into account, this means that an additional £1.1bn would be needed to provide the same level of service as last year,"" the report warned. It said some councils had made savings in the past by freezing fees paid to providers, but care providers were now also facing financial problems. Some companies - particularly those in southern England - are struggling to attract staff, amid increasing concern about the quality of care, it said. ""What is at stake is the continuing capacity of adult social care to sustain services to those in greatest need,"" ADASS president Ray James said. ""In virtually all our authorities, the number in need is growing, while the complexity of their needs is increasing."" ADASS called for the government to ""protect essential care and support services to the most vulnerable members of our community"". But a government spokesman said the survey ""ignores"" a commitment to invest £10bn in health services that are being ""joined up"" with social care, by 2020. The BBC has launched an online guide to the care system for the over-65s. The ""care calculator"" covers residential care and the support provided in people's own homes, for tasks such as washing and dressing. Users can submit their postcode and find out how much each service costs where they live in the UK. There is also a dedicated BBC Cost of Care website, with news stories, analysis and video. The spokesman said: ""Increasing budgets isn't the only solution. By working innovatively and joining up health and social care we can improve care and also save money."" However, Councillor Izzi Seccombe, from the Local Government Association (LGA), said adult social care services were facing ""enormous pressures"" due to ""insufficient funding, growing demand and escalating costs"". ""We have long warned that investing in the NHS whilst social care budgets are under continual pressure is simply a false economy. ""It is social care services that support elderly and vulnerable people to maintain their independence, live in their own community and stay out of hospital longer,"" she added. Caroline Abrahams, charity director at Age UK, said the idea of a further £1bn coming out of social care budgets was ""chilling"".

A reading below 50 indicates falling output. It is the first time that activity in the sector has fallen since March 2013. Firms blamed soft domestic demand, a fall in new business from overseas and uncertainty ahead of the EU referendum. A slowdown in the oil and gas industry, a major customer for UK companies, is also hitting production. The index for new orders fell to 50.4 in April, from 51.9 the month before, matching February's three-year low. Rob Dobson, senior economist at Markit, said: ""On this evidence manufacturing production is now falling at a quarterly pace of around 1%, and will likely act as a drag on the economy again during the second quarter and putting greater pressure on the service sector to sustain GDP growth. ""The manufacturing labour market is also being impacted, with the data signalling close to 20,000 job losses over the past three months."" Last week, official figures showed UK economic growth slowed to 0.4% in the first quarter of the year from 0.6% in late 2015, propped up by the services sector. David Noble, group chief executive at the Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply (CIPS), said: ""Recent fears over a stall in the UK's manufacturing sector have now become a reality. ""An atmosphere of deep unease is building throughout the manufacturing supply chain, eating away at new orders, reducing British exports and putting more jobs at risk. ""A sense of apprehension across the sector is being caused by enduring volatility in the oil and gas industry, falling retailer confidence and the uncertainty created by the EU referendum."" The Markit/CIPS survey found new export orders contracted for the fourth straight month in April as the global economy continued to slow. A measure of employment in the manufacturing sector was also below the 50 mark for its fourth straight month. Lee Hopley, chief economist at the manufacturers' organisation, EEF, said: ""The sharp drop to a three-year low and another month of reported job cuts could be the clearest sign yet that referendum uncertainty is starting to weigh on the real economy. ""However, this is just another straw on the back of a sector already grappling with the struggling oil and gas sector, softening domestic demand and weak order outlook from other parts of the world, all of which are failing to provide any counterbalance to the political uncertainty at home.""",0,2,1

The Blick Mead site is about 1.5 miles (2.4km) from Stonehenge and archaeologists said ""scientifically tested charcoal"" dug up from the site had ""revealed that it dated from around 4000 BC"". David Jacques said the dig had also found ""evidence of feasting"" including burnt flints, tools and remains of giant cattle, known as aurochs, which were eaten by early hunter gatherers. Mr Jacques said: ""British pre-history may have to be rewritten. This is the latest dated Mesolithic encampment ever found in the UK.

""But our only chance to find out about the earliest chapter of Britain's history could be wrecked if the tunnel goes ahead."" Andy Rhind-Tutt, a former mayor and current chairman of Amesbury Museum, which part-funded the dig, said the discovery could ""provide what archaeologists have been searching for centuries - the answer to the story of the pre-history of Stonehenge.""

The couple spoke out in response to consultation on proposed reform of sentencing for driving offences. They believe increased sentences should be backed up by manslaughter charges. Mr Moores, 28, was killed by a Vauxhall Astra driven by Donna Hackett on the M4 near Swindon. Hackett, then aged 26, fled and was found by police asleep in a ditch. She served half of a six-year jail term after she was found guilty of causing death by careless driving while drunk. The Ministry of Justice consultation suggests offenders who cause death by careless driving while under the influence of drink or drugs could soon be handed a life sentence - an increase on the current 14-year upper limit. Source: Crown Prosecution Service But Mr and Mrs Moores, from Chandlers Ford, Hampshire, also want the offence to be upgraded to a charge of manslaughter. Mr Moores said: ""Somebody can drive drunk and kill my son. Why is that not manslaughter? ""Nothing can prepare a parent for seeing their child in the mortuary. That will stay with me every day, every day that vision comes into my mind. ""Our life is ruined."" Mrs Moores added: ""There's nothing careless about drink driving. I don't want anybody else to feel like us."" Ms Hackett, who lived in Radnor Street, Swindon, at the time of the offence, appealed against her sentence in September 2011, but was refused.

The group has warned that 750 more foster carers are ""urgently"" needed to meet the demands of the care system. It urged people to ""open their hearts and homes"" to vulnerable youngsters. Currently, more than 5,500 children are in foster care in Scotland, living with 4,400 families and carers. The Fostering Network surveyed 250 children, teenagers and foster carers across Scotland and discovered that many young people had failed to find stability. Almost half were already living with their third family, a quarter were with their fourth family and about 20 were living with their 10th family since going into care. There was a particular need for homes to be found for vulnerable teenagers, siblings and disabled children, the study found. Carla, 23, was taken into care at the age of 12 and had eight foster homes before moving in with the Randalls. ""Looking back now I realised that the Randalls saved my life,"" she said. ""I never understood the extent of the neglect and abuse I had endured until I came to live with a 'normal' loving family. ""They were just always themselves, the smallest details meant so much to me. ""They nurtured a young, angry, untrusting teenager to become a positive, empathetic and successful young woman."" The Fostering Network said instability had a detrimental effect on the child's education and wellbeing, while finding a stable foster carer from the outset could lead to improved relationships and a happier childhood. Sara Lurie, director of the Fostering Network Scotland, said: ""As each year passes, we see more and more children coming into care. ""We need people who can open their heart, and their homes, to vulnerable children and young people and use their skills to help support them to reach their full potential. ""In particular we need people who have the skills, patience and passion to look after teenagers who may have had a really tough time and be facing some real challenges, and to offer them love, stability and security. ""A good foster carer will believe in the ambition of the children in their care in the same way they'd believe in the ambition of their biological family members."" Apologies for the delay, see below as requested. A Scottish government spokeswoman said: ""Giving young people security is paramount and we have done a great deal of work with our partners across local government and the third sector to improve how we intervene early when there is a problem within families to find appropriate solutions quickly. ""We have also expanded the age at which young people can remain in foster care as part of the continuing care provisions and the support available when they transition into independent living.""",0,1,1

Anti","Adrian Ismay, 52, was seriously hurt after a booby-trap device exploded under his van in Belfast on 4 March. The police said that a post-mortem examination showed he died as a ""direct result of the injuries"" of the bomb. A dissident republican group, widely referred to as the new IRA, said it carried out the attack. The organisation said Mr Ismay was targeted for training officers at Maghaberry Prison near Lisburn, County Antrim. Sue McAllister, director general of the Northern Ireland Prison Service, spent time with the Ismay family on Wednesday. She said they were ""devastated and beyond shock at what's happened"". ""Like all of us, they thought that he was on the mend and was doing really well,"" said Mrs McAllister. ""We thought he would make a full recovery, we expected him to come back to work in due course, so we're all shocked, but particularly Sharon and her daughters."" Mrs McAllister condemned the behaviour of some paramilitary inmates at Maghaberry Prison, who reportedly cheered, smoked cigars and mocked wardens at the high-security jail when news of Mr Ismay's death filtered through. ""This was just unacceptable behaviour by a very small number of prisoners,"" said Mrs McAllister. ""My colleagues in Maghaberry dealt with it professionally, with great fortitude and with the courage they display on a daily basis."" She admitted she and her colleagues in the Prison Service felt ""very angry"" on hearing the reports of the celebrations in the exercise yard of the prison. ""We encounter challenging behaviour by a small number of prisoners every day, and we deal with it with great professionalism and we do not stoop to behaving that way in response,"" she added. A man appeared in court on Saturday charged in connection with the bomb attack on Mr Ismay. Det Ch Insp Richard Campbell said it was ""yet another difficult day for the Ismay family, his friends and colleagues as they struggle to come to terms with the events of the past 12 days"".

""We are also liaising with the Public Prosecution Service in relation to the individual who is currently charged with attempted murder and causing an explosion with intent to endanger life.""

India is the third-largest economy in Asia but has been struggling with inflation and currency weakness. Since July last year, the Indian rupee has seen one of the biggest declines among Asian currencies, dropping more than 27% against the US dollar.

The BBC's Yogita Limaye in Mumbai said that just a year ago India was aspiring for double-digit growth. But a global slowdown has reduced external demand, and high inflation coupled with a weak rupee has made things more expensive within the country. Domestic demand, which India's economy is largely reliant on, has also slowed in part due to the political upheaval in the country. India's economy is suffering from ""policy incoherence, shifting global risk appetite and a comatose government"", said Rajeev Malik, senior economist at brokerage CLSA India's Prime Minister Manmohan Singh admitted early this month that his government must do more to get the once fast-growing economy moving again.

Robert Barrington, of anti-corruption campaigners Transparency International, said: ""The prime minister is creating a platform for governments that are serious about fighting corruption to make really significant changes and set the agenda for a generation to come. ""What is key now is that other governments are persuaded to sign up to ambitious targets and that the UK government does not give in to the usual last minute attempts by less committed countries to water down the summit's ambitions"".",0,1,1

Archaeologist David Jacques, said: ""They... used the stump of the tree, about three metres high, as a wall."" The finds are being shown to United Nations heritage experts, who are currently visiting Stonehenge. Archaeologists are concerned a planned 2.9km tunnel being considered for the nearby A303 main road will damage the site. Discoveries have also shown stones were warmed up by the Mesolithic Period inhabitants and used in a hearth to emit heat in the earthy snug. Mr Jacques, a senior research fellow at the University of Buckingham, has worked at Blick Mead for over a decade, making a number of discoveries about the inhabitants. The tree stump created a wall height similar to a ""modern bungalow"". ""They've draped probably animal skins or thatch around the basin and connected it to a post so it's a very comfortable snug little place,"" he said. The wooden wall of the hollow was lined with flints and the large earthy pit created by the tree root lined with cobbles and decorated with ""exotic"" stones from outside the area. ""There are some clever and sophisticated things going on, the hot stones that they put into this little type of alcove wouldn't have been on fire,"" explained Mr Jacques. ""It looks more like these people have been using these hot stones as a type of storage heater so that you've got a lot of warmth coming off them."" Mr Jacques will meet the UN experts later to ask for the route to be moved closer to Salisbury and for hydrological assessments to be made. ""It's very likely the water flow would be reduced in and around the site,"" he said. ""It would take out all the organics and destroy all the animal bone we've been finding which is crucial for finding where they have been living and for getting radiocarbon dates from all the organics like pollen and wood. ""This is massively important for reconstructing what the landscape would have looked like."" Andy Rhind-Tutt, former mayor and chairman of Amesbury Museum and Heritage Trust said: ""I sincerely hope the team delivering the long-awaited A303 improvement look seriously at an alternative alignment south of Salisbury and away from this unequalled archaeological landscape. ""It would be criminal to destroy such a rich heritage and connection with our ancestors for the sake of blocking the view to the passing public of Stonehenge.""",0,2,1

But despite the church's best efforts the bats are not moving and are soiling the altar and church furniture, leaving the church with an ""appalling smell"". The creatures are protected by law and cannot be wilfully disturbed. Volunteers at the church have been working for the past decade to keep the altar, stonework and woodwork clean. But the bats, roosting in the higher areas of the church continually soil the interior of the building with urine and faeces. Church warden Liz Cowley said keeping the 11th Century building in good shape was difficult. She said: ""You can see the urine marks (on the altar), they won't go away. ""If people were coming in here damaging an ancient building like this, you would say it was criminal damage. ""The smell is appalling, it's a combination of ammonia from the urine and a musty smell from the droppings that catches at the back of the throat."" Members of the church had spent Â£10,000 trying to get the bats to move and had paid for specially-built lofts nearby. The Rev Paul Mothersdale, the Rector of St Hilda's Church, said a lot of money had been invested in trying to persuade the bats to move out of the church. The Rev Mothersdale said: ""We've tried to do everything that English Nature, or Natural England, have wanted us to do. ""Money has been spent, not only by the congregation, not only out of church funds, but local people have mucked in and helped. ""And yet we're no further forward, we're still as we were 10 years ago."" Lucy Bellini, of Natural England, said the bats had to be carefully monitored. Ms Bellini said: ""It is a really regionally important roost. ""Because of that we need to be sure that there are replacement roosts that are suitable and that the bats have found and are aware of and can move to before we allow the church to seal up access points and move the bats out of the church.""",0,1,1

Your","A ""terrorist hide"" was uncovered at Capanagh Forest near Larne after two members of the public found suspicious objects in the woods on Saturday. Some of the items found included an armour-piercing improvised rocket and two anti-personnel mines. The main line of police inquiry is the arms belonged to dissident republicans. Last week, Home Secretary Theresa May said MI5 believed an attack on targets in Great Britain by dissident republicans had become ""a strong possibility"". Analysis: Vincent Kearney, BBC News NI's home affairs correspondent The discovery of what appears to be a second dissident republican arms dump near Larne within three months has left police baffled. Based on location alone, the analysis would be that the items found most likely belonged to loyalist paramilitaries. But the nature of what was found suggests otherwise and the finger of suspicion firmly in the direction of dissident republicans. Det Supt Kevin Geddes said the threat level in Northern Ireland from dissident republican groups remains ""severe"" and an attack is ""highly likely"". Police officers found three barrels hidden in holes in the forest. As well as rockets and mines, there were also several pipe bombs, assault rifle ammunition and parts to construct a ""substantial number of explosive devices"". Det Supt Geddes said the seizure was significant ""both in terms of its size and its capability"". ""A number of these devices were ready to be deployed,"" he added. ""This seizure has undoubtedly saved lives."" He said the type of weapons that had been found meant police would focus their investigation on dissident republicans. In March, an arms find was made at Carnfunnock Country Park near Larne, and police said the were investigating a connection between the two discoveries. ""There are links in terms of the general location and the manner and method of storage and packaging of these munitions,"" Det Supt Geddes said. He added that police are ""indebted"" to the two people who noticed the suspicious objects in the Capanagh Forest.",0,1,1

He had previously opposed an assisted dying law, but said his illness has left him ""like a beached whale"" and in constant discomfort. ""My position has changed,"" he wrote to Baroness D'Souza. Stage and TV actor Lord Rix, who specialised in post-war ""Whitehall farce"" comedies, is receiving 24-hour care in a retirement home. ""My position has changed. As a dying man, who has been dying now for several weeks, I am only too conscious that the laws of this country make it impossible for people like me to be helped on their way, even though the family is supportive of this position and everything that needs to be done has been dealt with. ""Unhappily, my body seems to be constructed in such a way that it keeps me alive in great discomfort when all I want is to be allowed to slip into a sleep, peacefully, legally and without any threat to the medical or nursing profession. ""I am sure there are many others like me who having finished with life wish their life to finish. ""Only with a legal euthanasia Bill on the statute books will the many people who find themselves in the same situation as me be able to slip away peacefully in their sleep instead of dreading the night."" The crossbench peer voted against an Assisted Dying Bill in 2006 because of concerns that people with learning disabilities might become the unwilling victims of euthanasia. He has been a prominent campaigner for people with learning disabilities after his daughter was born with Down's syndrome. He said his children were ""absolutely supportive"" of his decision and that he has ""wrapped up"" his affairs and was ""ready to go"" to ""put an end to this misery, pain and discomfort"". ""I can't do anything but lie here thinking 'Oh Christ, why am I still here?' They won't let me die and that's all I want to do,"" he said. He added the doctors and nurses ""do their best for me"" but that it was ""not good enough because what I want is to die, and the law stops them from helping me with that"". He had discussed with his children the possibility of travelling to the Dignitas clinic in Switzerland, but felt it would be ""unfair to them to push them into a situation where they are helping me to die"". Lord Rix said he had not been given an estimate from doctors as to how long he will live, adding: ""I think it's wrong that people like me are stranded like this.

His intervention in the debate - made, as he termed it, with ""deafening eclat"" - was even said to have helped cause the pound to slide on the international money markets as traders thought it made the possibility of a so-called Brexit more likely. He has arguably the highest profile of any of the governing Conservative Party except the Prime Minister David Cameron, but those outside the UK may be wondering: who is he, and is that actually his hair? Read on. Profile: Boris Johnson How could 'zip wire prat' become prime minister? Read more about the UK's referendum on the EU Alexander Boris de Pfeffel Johnson, to give him his full name, was born in New York and is descended from Turkish, French and German stock. He describes himself as a ""one-man melting pot"". He first made a name for himself in journalism, including a stint as Brussels correspondent for the right-wing Daily Telegraph newspaper and editor of The Spectator magazine. His humorous persona led him to become a fixture on various television programmes, including the satirical BBC panel show Have I Got News For You. He still has a lucrative and entertaining column in the Daily Telegraph, in which august forum he explained the reasons for his decision on the EU. As a politician, he has been a Conservative member of parliament for two constituencies, Henley from 2001 to 2008 and then Uxbridge and South Ruislip from 2015. Lest you think he was putting his feet up between parliamentary mandates, he is also currently serving the second of two terms as mayor of London, no mean feat in a city where the centre-left Labour Party has dominated in recent decades. That's indicative of the position Mr Johnson has carved out for himself as one of the most charismatic politicians in the UK who has wide appeal beyond Conservative heartlands - polling has suggested that his stance on the EU referendum may sway some undecided voters. Just look what happens when you type his name into Google.co.uk. Not quite. He has previously courted controversy for his remarks about (among others) the populations of Liverpool, Portsmouth and Papua New Guinea, not to mention run-ins with his own party leadership and TV chef Jamie Oliver. Last October he accidentally flattened a 10-year-old schoolboy at what was meant to be a friendly game of photo-op rugby in Japan. But none of this seems to have affected his standing among the party faithful or the public at large. Even getting stuck on a zip-wire during the London Olympics in 2012, a sure-fire route to derision for any other politician, only enhanced his eccentric image. Mr Johnson finally ended months of speculation about which side of the EU debate he would back in an immaculately impromptu media scrum outside his home in North London, having reportedly informed the prime minister of his decision earlier the same day.

Lee, 84, has never explained why she stopped writing. She doesn't give interviews - ""Hell, no"" was her response to a request several decades ago - and that silence has only added to the intrigue. But her close friend Thomas Lane Butts, a retired minister in her hometown, Monroeville, Alabama, says she once told him the reason. Sitting on a pew in the Methodist church which the Lee family still attends, he described to me how she suddenly brought the subject up one night over dinner in New York. ""She asked me, 'You ever wonder why I didn't write anything else?' And I said, 'Along with several million other people, yes, I had wondered about that.' And she said, 'Well, what do you think?'"" Speaking in his slow southern drawl, the Rev Butts, who just turned 80, suggested to her that she had already written a great book and therefore didn't need to compete with herself. ""And when I got through she said, 'You're all wrong.' I said, 'Alright, smart Alec. You tell me.' She said, 'I would not go through all the deprivation of privacy through which I went for this book again for any amount of money.' ""And she said, 'I did not need to write another book. I said what I wanted to say in that book.'"" Harper Lee called it a simple tale about the ""conflict of the human soul"" and Monroeville, Alabama, is where she drew her inspiration. The story depicts the segregated South of her childhood, during the Depression. It was published at the height of the civil rights struggle. The Rev Butts grew up 10 miles outside Monroeville. By the late 1950s, he says, he was a ""fuzzy-cheeked young preacher"" campaigning for an end to segregation. He had met Martin Luther King Jr and signed a petition to boycott buses. The Ku Klux Klan had left a burning cross on his front lawn. He says To Kill a Mockingbird was not well received in Monroeville when it was published. ""The people who were hard racist did not like it because of the implication of the book,"" the Rev Butts told me. ""The book revealed racism and that always frightens a racist - when you pull the cover off them. ""Those of us who stood up for civil rights were much encouraged by the book because in a very skilful and subtle way it addressed itself for justice."" But these days, the Rev Butts says, there is enormous civic pride in Monroeville. The old courthouse, which Hollywood re-created for the film, now houses a museum to Harper Lee and the town's other literary icon, Truman Capote. Capote was a childhood friend of hers and is thought to be the inspiration for the Dill character in To Kill a Mockingbird. The town's residents often try to protect Lee, allowing her to live a normal life instead of being hounded by fans or bothered with prying questions. ""Being famous",1,5,5

Article: The","It means bloggers with more than 3,000 daily readers must register with the mass media regulator, Roskomnadzor, and conform to the regulations that govern the country's larger media outlets. Internet companies will also be required to allow Russian authorities access to users' information. One human rights group called the move ""draconian"". The law was approved by Russia's upper house of parliament in April. It includes measures to ensure that bloggers cannot remain anonymous, and states that social networks must maintain six months of data on its users. The information must be stored on servers based in Russian territory, so that government authorities can gain access. Critics see it as the latest in a series of recent moves to curb internet freedom. Hugh Williamson, of New York-based Human Rights Watch, has called the law ""another milestone in Russia's relentless crackdown on free expression"". ""The internet is the last island of free expression in Russia and these draconian regulations are clearly aimed at putting it under government control,"" he added. Opposition figures have used the internet to air their views, with some gaining millions of followers. Commentators opposing Vladimir Putin often face restrictions in broadcast outlets and newspapers. Analysis: Famil Ismailov, news editor, BBCRussian.com Russian bloggers are bracing themselves for the moment when Russia's new ""information security law"" comes into force on 1 August. Some already share advice on how to use proxy servers in order to access social media sites that, in their view, are under threat of being closed. It is hard to see how the law will be enforced. The servers for most of the popular social media platforms that many Russians use are based outside Russia. Many popular bloggers are already looking for, and apparently finding, ways to ""cheat"" the feature that counts page visits and keep their daily unique visitor numbers just under 3000, or to make sure that the statistics are hidden altogether. Anton Nossik, who is considered Russia's ""internet guru"", wrote in his LiveJournal blog that the new law didn't threaten individual bloggers directly, but provided legal grounds to block popular social networks like Facebook, Twitter, LiveJournal and Google. ""The issue of banning all these platforms in Russia is a political one and it will be decided by only one person"", Mr Nossik wrote, with a thinly veiled reference to President Vladimir Putin. Earlier in the year, Russia enacted a law that gave the government powers to block websites without explanation. In March, Moscow blocked the blog of Mr Navalny, along with two news sites and a organisation run by Garry Kasparov - a vocal critic of the Russian government. In a statement, Russia's prosecutor general's office said the blocks were imposed because of the sites' role in helping stage illegal protests. Earlier this week, Twitter blocked access to an anti-Kremlin account that often publishes leaked government documents, following a request by Russia's federal communications agency Roskomnadzor. For many years, Russia had relatively lax internet laws. However Moscow has recently changed its tune, with Mr Putin branding the internet an ongoing ""CIA project"". He also claimed that",1,3,3

He admitted culpable homicide on the basis of diminished responsibility after saying he had no recollection of the killing at Dixon Avenue, Glasgow, on 24 September last year. Buksh will be sentenced on 27 June. The High Court in Glasgow heard that 43-year-old Mrs Buksh died after being struck on the head at least five times. Pathologists told the court that the lack of defensive injuries and the position of her body suggested she was assaulted as she slept. Following the attack, Buksh went to Cathcart Police Station and told an officer: ""I've come to hand myself in. I think my wife's dead. I hit her on the head. I did it."" The court was told that three psychiatrists described Buksh as suffering from an acute stress disorder at the time. Prosecutor Gordon Lamont said: ""The accused and his wife had been married for 25 years, but over the last 10 or 11 years their relationship appears to have broken down and they became increasingly estranged, albeit, still residing under the one roof. ""They slept separately and Mrs Buksh routinely slept on the sofa in the living room. Their children report that they barely spoke to each other."" Mr Lamont said the problems in the marriage intensified after Mrs Buksh went to Pakistan on holiday in May last year. He said she had become involved with another man and was making plans to move to Pakistan. The court also heard that two days before he killed his wife, Buksh went to Paisley Police Office and spoke with a support officer saying he feared his wife was going to take their youngest child, aged 10, to Pakistan and not return. He also made an emergency doctor's appointment and said he was suffering from stress and not sleeping. He was prescribed medication for stress. Defence counsel Sarah Livingstone said: ""My client has no memory of this incident. His amnesia is absolutely genuine. ""This is not a case where this man was a bad husband, there was no domestic abuse. This was an unhappy marriage, but however, unhappy it was it didn't justify killing his wife. ""He suffered an acute stress reaction. Three psychiatrists all agree that he was suffering from an abnormality of the mind."" Judge Lord Burns deferred sentence on Buksh until 27 June at the High Court in Edinburgh for background reports.",0,1,1

""Do we have any mead makers or home brewers in the group?"" asks Ben Alexander, eying a crowd of a dozen or so people who have come to his Maine Meade Works, in Portland, on a rainy Friday for a tour. When no-one raises their hand, Mr Alexander launches into the full spiel. ""If you guys want to come around, I'll show you how this thing works,"" he says, gesturing to two ceiling-high columns of stainless steel filled with something resembling a mushy golden porridge. ""We mix up honey and water over there and we pump it through a hot water bath at 160 degrees [71C] in a stainless steel coil here. Each one produces about 50 to 75 gallons [227-340 litres] of mead a day,"" explains Mr Alexander. It's fair to say he is obsessed with mead. ""It's the quintessential local beverage - you can go anywhere in the world and find honey to make mead, and I think that's unique among alcoholic beverages,"" he gushes. After being introduced to the drink by a home brewer, Mr Alexander thought there were profits to be had in a commercial meadery. He founded Maine Mead Works in 2008, pouring his savings and money from friends and family into the business. His business has since grown, along with the popularity of mead in the US. It's now a seven-person operation that manufactures more than 7,500 cases a year, shipping them as far away as China. Mr Alexander is not the only one to have caught on to the commercial potential of mead. Vicky Rowe, the owner of mead information website GotMead, says interest in the product in the US has exploded in the past decade. ""We went from 30-40 meaderies making mead to somewhere in the vicinity of 250 in the last 10 years,"" she says. ""I like to say that everything old is new again - people come back to what was good once."" Even visitors to Mr Alexander's meadery agree. Tour participant Dirk Heseman admitted that while Maine Mead Works was the first meadery he'd actually visited, he has noticed that mead ""is becoming more and more available - similar to cider"". Just this year, commercial meaderies in the US have banded together to form an industry group, the American Mead Makers Association, to better share information and encourage growth in the industry. But there's a lot of work that needs to be done to improve the image of a drink long associated with Renaissance fairs and medieval re-enactments. ""I think our number one challenge as an industry is awareness of what mead is,"" says Mr Alexander. ""You ask 10 people in a room if they've ever heard of mead, and two of them might say, 'yes', and only one of them has had a very positive experience."" The mead of the past was often sweet, and didn't appeal to many drinkers",0,2,1

The apes began to disappear from the documents about 150 years ago, corresponding with population growth. The study is published in the Proceedings of the Royal Society B. Hainan gibbons are now limited to a few isolated patches of forest in the south west of China. They live in just four social groups, one of which was only discovered a few weeks ago. Understanding this population crash has been difficult, but the old government documents have helped to reveal when and how the numbers fell. Dr Sam Turvey, from the Zoological Society of London, said: ""China is one of the few places in the world that has a very very rich, long historical record. ""Because it has had such a complex bureaucracy for so long, there has been a lot of need for reporting - not just numbers of households for tax purposes and things like that, but also in terms of the kinds of natural resources that were available in the immediate environment."" These included records of animals, including gibbons, he said. ""We looked at the pattern of disappearance of gibbons through time and how that varied from place to place and the different environmental conditions and human pressures that were also present in these places."" The archives show that gibbons were a common sight in about 20 provinces in China well into the 17th and 18th Century. However, Dr Turvey said it was ""a stark contrast to their very imperilled position today"". ""We see a really steep increase in population decline and real population collapse across China about 100-150 years ago,"" he added. ""And this correlates with demographic expansion in China towards the end of the Imperial era and through the 20th Century, and the massive increase in deforestation and human population growth through the time of the Chinese Republic and the establishment of the communist party."" The researchers said a better understanding of the animals' decline would help them to establish a conservation plan for the country's last few Hainan gibbons. Dr Turvey said: ""It is an incredible privilege to be able to see gibbons in China in the wild. ""The Hainan gibbon is such as rare species, but knowing that this species is still hanging on there gives you hope that conservation will be able to bring that population back from the brink.""

1. The match was a draw.

2. Pakistan seemed to be cruising to a draw before debutant Adil Rashid - who returned 0-163 in the first innings - turned the match with five wickets. Needing 99 to win, England sent out Jos Buttler","Pakistan seemed to be cruising to a draw before debutant Adil Rashid - who returned 0-163 in the first innings - turned the match with five wickets. Needing 99 to win, England sent out Jos Buttler and Ben Stokes in the top four. But they were eventually beaten by the fading light, finishing 25 runs short of a famous victory on 74-4. The tourists could not find the boundary frequently enough before the umpires brought the teams off, with Joe Root 33 not out. However, this was a hugely impressive performance from England and one that will fill them with confidence ahead of the second Test in Dubai, which begins on Thursday. After England concluded their innings on 598-9 in the morning, Pakistan looked assured at 113-3 shortly after tea, leading by 38 with seven second-innings wickets remaining. But the match turned when veteran batsman Younus Khan, playing in his 102nd Test match, mistimed a wild heave to give Rashid his first Test wicket - caught at point by Stokes. Rashid - whose figures in the first innings were the worst ever by a debutant - then quickly added a second victim, having Asad Shafiq caught behind for six. The door was opened for England, and Rashid and Moeen Ali barged through it as they polished off the last five wickets for 14 runs. Pakistan skipper Misbah ul-Haq - who had played with restraint for his 51 - inexplicably aimed an uncharacteristic slog at Moeen and was bowled. Moeen then removed Wahab Riaz caught behind, before Rashid claimed the final three wickets - all superbly caught at first slip by James Anderson. England sensed an unlikely victory, but their reorganised batting order could not score quickly enough as Pakistan's tactic of spin from both ends and fielders on the boundary brought them regular wickets. Makeshift opener Buttler was trapped lbw for four, Moeen and Stokes were caught on the boundary in quick succession, and Jonny Bairstow was stumped attempting a big shot. However, in truth it was mistakes earlier in the match that ultimately proved more costly as England fell just short of their first win on the subcontinent since beating India in Kolkata in 2012. In Pakistan's first innings, Ian Bell dropped Mohammad Hafeez (98) and Shafiq (107) at slip early in their innings. And Shoaib Malik, who made 245, was dismissed off a no-ball by Stuart Broad. England captain Alastair Cook, whose record-breaking 263 in the first innings was ultimately in vain, admitted England were frustrated to come so close to victory. ""We'd have liked another three or four overs at the end but that's the way it goes,"" he said. ""I can't fault the guys for hanging in there on that wicket. ""The pitch did deteriorate and spun more today which gave us hope, so it's a bit of a bittersweet finish. We knew we had to put the pressure on Pakistan and then on the last day you never know.

He was speaking to the BBC after taking part in the 4x100m mixed medley relay final, in which defending champions Britain finished fifth.

Wrockwardine Wood and Sutherland academies, also run by the Telford Co-operative Multi-Academy Trust, were put in special measures earlier this week. The trust has not commented. Ofsted criticised the trust's lack of support to the schools and said each was now considering an alternative sponsor. Inspectors said pupils' achievement at the Phoenix Academy had dropped since it became an academy in 2013 and their latest report rated it inadequate in all areas. A report in 2013, before it converted, rated the secondary school as ""requiring improvement"", while Lakeside was rated ""good"" in 2012 under its former name the Lord Silkin School. In the latest report, inspectors said the curriculum at Phoenix Academy was ""inadequate"", while ""weak teaching"" meant pupils were not sufficiently challenged and were often ""disengaged and disruptive"". There was particular criticism of standards in English and maths which the watchdog said were limiting pupils' achievements in other areas. Ofsted's report said governors, managers and teachers had developed a ""culture of low expectations"", while leaders had failed to act decisively to halt the decline in pupils' achievement. There was, however, some praise for the acting head teacher. Inspectors said he had introduced a number of improvement measures and some were ""beginning to have an impact"". A report on Lakeside School highlighted similar concerns, criticising teachers for not sufficiently challenging pupils and for having ""over generous"" predictions of their achievement. Inspectors said many pupils, whether high achievers or those with special educational needs, were ""not making the progress they should"" and achievements at GCSE were well below the national average. Governors were also criticised for not holding leaders to account, while the report said management had failed to effectively monitor either pupils or teachers.

The hosts, slacker after the break, had beleaguered striker Larnell Cole sent-off after he confronted the referee. Liam Craig sealed the win from the penalty spot with two minutes to play, before Graham Cummins finished a sumptuous stoppage-time move. And things got worse still for Caley Thistle after the match, with captain Gary Warren shown a red card in the tunnel. Saints remain five points clear of Hearts in fourth place, and closed the gap on third-placed Rangers, who play Aberdeen on Sunday, to three points. With game after game ticking past, Inverness' position looks increasingly perilous. Next weekend's trip to Motherwell, second-bottom on goal difference, is now seismic. This contest turned nightmarish for the hosts after a bright opening, but the truth is, given their predicament, Caley Thistle did not threaten St Johnstone's goal enough. Billy Mckay sent a shot over from close range. Alex Fisher nodded a diving header wide. Carl Tremarco miscued a volley. Greg Tansey did draw a save from Alan Mannus when he rasped in an effort from outside the box, but Richie Foran's side never looked likely to find the net. Their best opportunity came immediately after the Saints went ahead, when Tansey fed Cole, who seemed to panic in a terrific position and shot straight at Mannus. Cole's dismissal ended the contest when he appeared to be cautioned twice for challenging referee Stephen Finnie's decision not to award a foul. St Johnstone were merciless and could have had more. With just one win from their last 21 league games, Inverness look deep in trouble. Tommy Wright's side deserve so much credit. Saints were tactically brilliant, so strong defensively and ruthlessly capitalised on their man advantage. They took one of their few first-half chances when Michael Coulson broke down the left and sent a dangerous ball across the six-yard box. Owain Fon Williams could only parry into the danger area, Cummins' shot was blocked but Maclean followed up to force it home. They should have had another when Craig's superb curling corner flew all the way to the back post where Cummins slid in and somehow knocked it over from two yards. Craig, in his 300th appearance for the club, coolly converted a spot-kick after Cummins was tripped to seal the points. Cummins then slammed home after Miller danced around the area to tee him up, before Craig cracked the bar amid the late flurry. With a tendency to finish the season strongly, and just a three-point gap to Rangers, the Perth side look capable of something special this term. Inverness CT manager Richie Foran: ""It is a tough time of the season to be sitting bottom, and I need real men to stand up to that, but not enough of them did that today. ""It is pure luck we are still in it and it is only four points. I sound like a broken record but one win changes it - that is the truth.

Their intention in travelling to the region, where areas are controlled by Islamic State (IS) militants or an al-Qaeda affiliate, is not clear. The Foreign Office has said it is in contact with the Turkish authorities. The BBC's Mark Lowen said the information about the ages of the children had not been independently verified and it was too early to know where the group were intending to head to. ""Were they heading for one of the more moderate groups in Syria. Were they heading for the area controlled by al-Nusra, the al-Qaeda affiliate? Or were they heading to so-called Islamic State territory?"" he said. The group was taken to a police station in southern Turkey overnight, and then sent to the foreigners department awaiting deportation to the UK. They have undergone medical examinations and had their finger-prints taken. The United Nations estimates the number of foreign fighters joining militant groups is more than 25,000, from 100 different nations. About 600 Britons are believed to have gone to Syria or Iraq since IS seized control of large swathes of territory there. Most are thought to have volunteered as fighters for the militant Islamist group. Around half are believed to have later returned to the UK, the Metropolitan Police has said. The latest detentions come two weeks after three British teenagers were stopped from travelling into Syria from Turkey. The three - two aged 17 and one 19, from north-west London - were arrested following a tip-off from British police and flown back to the UK. They have since been released on police bail. They had flown to Turkey from Barcelona and were arrested at Sabiha Gokcen airport in Istanbul. Fadi Hakura, Turkey analyst for Chatham House, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the recent arrests showed the Turkish government was ""taking more effective measures to control the flow of fighters and supporters into Syria"". He said there was now ""more enhanced security and intelligence cooperation between Turkey and its Western counterparts, especially with the exchange of names that Turkey needs to prohibit [IS supporters] from crossing into Syria"". The Turkish government has said it cannot make a 560-mile border watertight and will act when it has prior warning. In February this year there were recriminations between British police and Turkish officials after three London schoolgirls disappeared from Turkey, apparently having crossed the border into Syria. Shamima Begum, Amira Abase, both 15, and Kadiza Sultana, 16 had flown to Istanbul and travelled to the border region.

""We were [rehearsing] in the tent for about a week and a half, then we had to move to bigger studios in Hollywood where we are working on the rest of the show,"" she told Houston radio station Mix 96.5. ""And then we will send that equipment to Houston where we will finish rehearsals. Fans can expect a performance that spans my career so far."" She has a high standard to live up to - notably Prince's show in 2007, which took place in the middle of a Miami thunderstorm and is widely accepted as the greatest performance in the event's history, if not Prince's career. Here are some of the other most memorable - and surprising - moments from the last 30 years. Super Bowl performers get a very strict 12-minute time limit, so most performers cram their set with as much music as possible. Not Michael Jackson. After shooting onto the stage at the Pasadena Rose Bowl, he stood completely still, staring at the world for a full 90 seconds. Ninety. It was a master class in ratcheting expectation to a fever pitch. And the screams when he launched into Jam (not one of his best songs) proved he knew what he was doing. Brilliantly, Jackson staged this entire performance while wearing a jacket it looked like he'd borrowed from Muammar Gaddafi. Beat that, Gaga. Baby, he was born to run... and slide on his knees... and crotch slam a TV camera. In his autobiography, The Boss explains the incident like this: ""Too much adrenalin, a late drop, too much speed, here I come, Mikeâ€¦ BOOM! ""And I'm onto his camera, the lens implanted into my chest with one leg off the stage. I use his camera to push myself back up andâ€¦ BLAM! BORN TO RUN!"" It led to the memorable headline: ""America Attacked by Bruce Springsteen's crotch"" - but it didn't stop the star delivering one of the most powerful and energetic Super Bowl shows in recent history.

""In future I will be better - definitely,"" said the former Barcelona and Bayern Munich coach. ""This season has been a massive lesson for me."" He added: ""We have a lot of beautiful things to fight for and to qualify for the Champions League will be a huge success. But we have to be honest with ourselves. We were not good enough to compete for the Premier League [title]."" Defeat at Stamford Bridge left City just four points ahead of Arsenal and Manchester United, both of whom have a game in hand. With the FA Cup being City's only realistic chance of winning a trophy this term, it is likely to be the worst season of Guardiola's managerial career. The 46-year-old has never gone a single season without winning a trophy - he has won the title in six out of seven attempts and his sides have always reached the last four of the Champions League. Guardiola has also responded to questions about a row between City and Chelsea coaching staff at Stamford Bridge following the defeat on Wednesday night. There have been conflicting claims about the precise nature of the row, but stewards were needed to calm the situation down after Chelsea's 2-1 win. The incident centred around a disagreement between Chelsea fitness coach Paolo Bertelli and Manchester City masseur Mark Sertori, both of whom speak Italian, as the Premier League leaders celebrated their victory. Guardiola said: ""We are so polite in our defeats and we are so polite when we win. When we win, normally we celebrate a little bit, then we go to the locker room. Chelsea manager Antonio Conte was not involved and has played the incident down. He said: ""Respect is the most important thing in football.""",0,1,1
openai_ada (0 shot),Please log in to add a comment.,"With three defeats in his previous six bouts, the Scottish boxer's career seemed to be on the wane. But his power, timing and focus returned in a supremely confident display at Glasgow's Hydro on Saturday night as he clinched the vacant WBA World Super-Lightweight title - and entered the record books as the first Scot to win world titles at three weights. Italy's Michele Di Rocco, at 34 a year older than Burns, hadn't lost a fight since September 2007. He arrived with a record of 40 wins and a draw from 42 bouts. He left a lesser figure. The referee deemed the man from Assisi to be in no state to continue in the eighth round, the result of a welter of blows to his head and body and made all the more unbearable by the hostile acoustic energy generated by 8,000 Scottish fans. Surely, for Burns, this was time to shout about his record, the ideal moment to counter all those who had written him off and questioned the wisdom of him leaving trainer Billy Nelson two years ago to work with Tony Sim in Essex? No. Instead, the champion spoke of his disbelief at the ease of his victory, his gratitude that he was safe, of his thanks to promoter Eddie Hearn, manager Alex Morrison and coach Sim for believing in him, and of his desire to celebrate with a fast-food burger and 20 chicken nuggets. ""When I got in the ring after the fight, I said, 'You've done it! You've done it!',"" reported a beaming Hearn at the post-fight media conference. ""And you know what Ricky said? 'Can you get a picture with me and Michael Buffer [the legendary American boxing ring announcer]?'"" When he has time to reflect during a well-earned holiday, Burns will take immense satisfaction at being only the third British-born fighter, after Bob Fitzsimmons and Duke McKenzie, to be a three-weight world champion. In Scottish terms, his achievements must mean that he is in the very top tier of boxing greats, comfortably mentioned in the same breath as former world champions Benny Lynch, Walter McGowan, Jackie Paterson, Ken Buchanan and Jim Watt, for example. Burns' record stands at 40 wins from 46 bouts. Remarkably, 11 of those have been world title fights. Buchanan's exploits in the United States add lustre to his legacy, but while Burns may never have fought someone like Roberto Duran, should Hearn manage to set up a bout against Cincinnati's Adrien Broner, the four-time world champion stripped of the WBA title because he could not make the weight, then Burns could achieve little more in the sport. ""There are some big fights out there for me,"" said Burns. ""I want to fight the top names. I will fight anybody. I do super-lightweight comfortably and lightweight is still an option. I would fight Terence Crawford again if it came down to it. ""That's nearly two years I have been with Tony and things have just started clicking. ""I had a bit of a bad run in the last year with stuff.",0,2,1

It also says they should not ratify a similar deal that has already been done between the EU and Canada. It says some aspects pose a threat to democracy and the rule of law. One of the concerns mentioned in the petition is the idea of tribunals that foreign investors would be able to use in some circumstances to sue governments. There is a great deal of controversy over exactly what this system, known as Investor State Dispute Settlement, would enable companies to do, but campaigners see it as an opportunity for international business to get compensation for government policy changes that adversely affect them. This kind of provision exists in many bilateral trade and investment agreements. Friends of the Earth have published new research on the impact they have had on EU countries. Information about these cases is not always made public, but the group says that going back to 1994, foreign investors have sought compensation of almost €30bn (£24bn) from 20 states. Where the results are known (a small minority of the total), the tribunals have awarded total compensation of €3.5bn (about £2.8bn). In Britain, the possible implications of this provision for the National Health Service have been especially controversial. Campaigners believe that the investor tribunals would make it harder to reverse any decisions to contract services out to international healthcare firms. John Hilary of War on Want said: TTIP ""will make it impossible for any future government to repeal the Health & Social Care Act and bring the NHS back into public hands"". The petition lists a number of other areas where its signatories believes European standards would suffer if the TTIP negotiations are completed and the Canada deal is ratified: employment, social, environmental, privacy and consumer protection. The European Commission says the EU will not have to sacrifice its high standards. It also says investor protection provisions are important for investment flows and have in general worked well. But it accepts there is a need for improvement and is trying to achieve that in its bilateral negotiations. The petition has been organised as an exercise called a European Citizens' Initiative which can lead to a public hearing in the European Parliament and require the European Commission to give a formal response explaining why it is accepting or rejecting what the petitioners call for. The European Commission has already said that the petition doesn't qualify as such an Initiative. Campaigners have launched a legal challenge to this decision.",0,2,2

Last month, the Supreme Court ruled that the anthem must be played in every cinema before a film is screened. Some 20 people have been held in Kerala and Tamil Nadu since then for remaining seated during the anthem. Also, India's colonial-era sedition law has been often used against students, journalists, writers and social activists and those critical of the government. Reports said that the BJP's youth wing lodged a complaint against a Facebook post by Mr Chavara which allegedly insulted the anthem. The post was apparently an excerpt from one of his books. Senior police official Sateesh Bino told the NDTV news channel that the writer-activist ""is being questioned for his controversial post on the national anthem on Facebook"" and had been charged with sedition. Earlier this month, 12 people were arrested at a cinema in Kerala, after they remained seated while the national anthem played. The cinemagoers, who were attending an international film festival, were later freed but they face charges of ""failure to obey an order issued by a public servant, thereby causing obstruction or annoyance to others"". And at a cinema in Chennai, eight people who did not stand for the anthem were assaulted and abused, police said. The eight were later charged with showing disrespect to the anthem.",0,2,2

A former leader of the Progressive Unionist Party, Ms Purvis has been director of the clinic since it was launched in 2012. Ms Purvis, who will step down on 24 April, said it was ""time to move on"". She will take on a new role on the clinic's Northern Ireland advisory board. Last November, anti-abortion protester Bernadette Smyth, who leads the Precious Life group, was convicted of harassing Ms Purvis at the Marie Stopes office in Belfast city centre. Ms Purvis told the BBC that had had no influence on her decision to step down. ""I think the clinic's well established here now, we're providing services more and more every year and I'm delighted to be remaining on the advisory board for the clinic. ""But I feel it's time to move on and I think it's time for Marie Stopes to get someone else in to manage the clinic and take it to new places,"" she said. ""At times it was difficult, particularly last year with the court case and the harassment, but I put that behind me and have concentrated on delivering services for women in Ireland both north and south. ""I think I've achieved a significant historical change in the perception of abortion in Northern Ireland from where the usual narrative was that abortion was illegal in Northern Ireland to now one where people understand that abortion is legal under certain circumstances. ""I think we've challenged the myths and stereotypes that are presented by those who are opposed to a woman's right to chose."" Genevieve Edwards, director of policy for Marie Stopes UK, said: ""We were so lucky to have Dawn and wish her every success in whatever she chooses to do.

The ruling preserves the law known as Obamacare, which Mr Obama considers a major part of his presidential legacy. Republicans have vowed to continue fighting the law. ""We've got more work to do, but what we're not going to do is unravel what has now been woven into the fabric of America,"" Mr Obama said. The case, known as King v Burwell, was the second major challenge the law has faced in the US's highest court. Unlike in many other western countries, the US does not have a single-payer healthcare system. Private companies, rather than the US government, provide health insurance for US citizens. The enactment of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) - one of Mr Obama's most significant and controversial domestic achievements - in 2010 mandated that every American had to purchase private insurance. It provided the subsidies to allow many to do so. In 2012, the mandate portion of the law was challenged in the court. The justices ruled to preserve it. In that decision, as in the decision on Thursday, Chief Justice John Roberts surprised observers by siding with his liberal colleagues in support of the law. ""Congress passed the Affordable Care act to improve health insurance markets, not to destroy them,"" Chief Justice John Roberts wrote in the opinion. Justice Anthony Kennedy dissented in 2012, but sided with the majority on Thursday. Had the court made the opposite decision, an estimated 8.7 million people in the US would have been at risk of losing the aid that makes healthcare affordable. The stakes could not have been higher. People's health (crucially important) and Obama's legacy (less important, but for him and those around him fairly vital) were at stake. Well a politically finely balanced Supreme Court has given an emphatic, overwhelming vote in favour of the president by 6-3. I bet ""No-drama Obama"" is high-fiving anyone and everyone in the White House - that is how big it is. Obama defies lame-duck expectations Demonstrators gathered outside the court as early on Thursday morning. Reading updates on their mobile phones, the crowd became jubilant when they learned mid-morning that the court had ruled in their favour. Some began dancing, while others chanted ""If you're covered and you know it clap your hands."" ""This is a big sigh of relief for millions across the country,"" said Ron Pollack of Families USA, a health-care advocacy organisation. ""The ACA is not just the law of the land, it will remain the law of the land"". ""Today is a good day for healthcare in America,"" said activist Benton Strong. ""I hope this is the end of the line."" Demonstrators opposing the subsidies did not have a large visible presence. Justice Antonin Scalia wrote in his dissent that the Supreme Court is setting a precedent of favouring some laws over others. ""We should start calling this law Scotuscare"" Justice Scalia wrote, referring to the court's acronym. ""Today's interpretation is not merely unnatural; it is unheard",0,1,2

State media picked up the story on Thursday, which was first reported in a local evening paper earlier this week. Liaoshen Wanbao reported the 49-year-old woman in Shenyang city had claimed her husband had divorced her 10 years ago because he disliked the shape of her face, said to be ""large and square"" with ""fat cheeks"". She said it spurred her to undergo facial surgery three times at a local hospital to shave her jawbones and reshape her face into a slimmer shape. During the third surgery the doctors discovered that if they proceeded further her nerves may be damaged, and halted the procedure. The woman, identified only by her surname Wang, later sued the hospital for 1.7 million yuan ($260,900; Â£183,900) in damages. She alleged the surgery had left her with soreness in her chin, and she could only eat and drink through a straw as ""when she exerted force on her lower jaw, she had the sensation that it would break"". The hospital, however, argued that the surgeries were conducted according to regulations, and pointed out that they encouraged her to seek psychiatric help instead of a third operation, which she refused. After mediation the woman agreed to accept 20,000 yuan ($3,100, Â£2,200) as compensation, said the report. On Weibo, some condemned the woman's husband, but others also chastised the woman. One top-voted comment read: ""It's purely an excuse, if her face was large then why did he decide to marry her in the first place? If he stopped loving her then he should have just said so."" It continued: ""This woman is also very silly to have believed that her face shape was the real reason for the divorce, she is lying to herself."" Said another Weibo user: ""Even if you had gone for facial surgery and made your face smaller, he would still have found other reasons to divorce you."" One person noted the sharp difference in the compensation amount and voiced suspicions: ""1.7 million was dropped to 20,000, it makes me wonder if she really did have a problem with her jaw."" Still others took the opportunity to crack jokes. ""What an odd reason for divorce! I wonder how square was this woman's square-shaped face? Like a television set? Microwave oven?""

The sites now redirect to a message explaining they have been blocked ""by decision of public authorities"". In 2015, the authorities banned 11 popular pornography websites, saying many failed to protect children ""from information harmful to their health"". Analysis by Vitaliy Shevchenko, BBC Monitoring The decision was made following two separate court rulings, which said the websites ""spread pornography"". Sexually explicit content is not outlawed in Russia, but the law bans ""the illegal production, dissemination and advertisement of pornographic materials and objects"". It is not uncommon for Russia to ban websites. The government agency Roskomnadzor maintains a blacklist that now includes thousands of them. Access is usually blocked for violating the notoriously vague extremism legislation or child protection laws. Websites critical of the Kremlin have been blocked too, and at one point Wikipedia was blacklisted. Following the 2015 ban, one woman asked Roskomnadzor on Twitter whether it could recommend an alternative. The agency replied: ""You can meet someone in real life."" On Tuesday, it said its earlier tweet was ""still relevant"". However, open rights campaigners have warned that local bans can be defeated. ""Blocking porn is the fastest way to ensure widespread adoption of censorship circumvention in your country,"" said Eva Galperin, global policy analyst at the Electronic Frontier Foundation. One of the affected porn sites offered Roskomnadzor a premium subscription to its service, in exchange for lifting the ban. The government agency said it was ""not in the market"" for such an offer. Nadya Tolokonnikova, lead singer from punk band Pussy Riot, joked that the ban was ""a blow below the belt"".",0,1,1

The murder, filmed on CCTV and on mobile phones, sparked outrage. The Church of the Almighty God cult is banned in China but claims to have millions of members. Following the brutal killing in May, Chinese authorities said that they detained hundreds of members of the cult, reports the BBC's Martin Patience in Beijing. Interviewed in prison later, one of the defendants, Zhang Lidong showed no remorse. He said: ""I beat her with all my might and stamped on her too. She was a demon. We had to destroy her."" The group had entered a small McDonalds branch in Zhaoyuan in Shandong province last May soliciting phone numbers and hoping to recruit members to their cult. Ms Wu was waiting in the restaurant with her seven-year-old son and when she refused to give her number, an act which prompted the beating while they screamed at other diners to keep away or they would face the same fate. The public face of the Church of the Almighty God is a website full of uplifting hymns and homilies. But its core belief is that God has returned to earth as a Chinese woman to wreak the apocalypse. The only person who claims direct contact with this god is a former physics teacher, Zhao Weishan, who founded the cult 25 years ago and has since fled to the United States, says BBC China Editor Carrie Gracie. No-one knows exactly where he is, but much of the website's message of outright hostility to the Chinese government is delivered in English as well as Chinese. The cult complains that religious faith has suffered from persecution by the Communist Party. Since the McDonald's murder, public outrage has forced the authorities to increase pressure on the Church of the Almighty God with almost daily arrests and raids.",0,1,1

""In a lifetime of pretty much impossible things that","Aided by dancers, confetti cannons and a man in a mirrored suit, the Canadian band revived revellers' spirits with a series of arms-aloft anthems. ""In a lifetime of pretty much impossible things that have happened to our band, this is the highlight,"" said frontman Win Butler. Earlier, every stage at the event was closed after lightning struck ground. Dance act Rudimental were escorted off the main stage mid-set, and had to abandon their planned encore - Feel The Love, with guest vocalist John Newman. ""We're quite upset,"" musician Amir Amor told the BBC, ""but we had a great time anyway"". Metallica's Lars Ulrich was flying into the site by helicopter as the storm descended. ""It was kind of frightening,"" he said. ""When we landed, all the people picking us up were going, 'we didn't expect you were going to fly in this weather'. ""But the pilot didn't say anything about that. We saw the lightning up there. I thought it was pyrotechnics for Arcade Fire."" The thunderstorm heralded a brief but torrential downpour, and the power cut took BBC coverage off the air. Music resumed on the main stage at 19:00 BST with Lily Allen, who dedicated an expletive-laden song to FIFA president Sepp Blatter. Other performers on Friday included Blondie, who proved so popular it became impossible to enter or leave The Other Stage at lunchtime, and Paolo Nutini, whose soulful ballads were a fitting soundtrack as dusk fell over Somerset. Sophie Ellis-Bextor sneaked some disco into her set at the largely-acoustic Avalon Stage, while the pulsing synthpop of Glaswegian band Chvrches made for a steamy atmosphere in the John Peel tent as fans danced off the downpour. Arcade Fire took to the stage shortly after 22:00 BST, their arrival heralded by a man dressed from head-to-toe in a mirrored suit. Bravely, considering the weather conditions, the 12-piece band were largely dressed in white, but if they were worried about laundry bills, it didn't show. They threw themselves around the stage, thrashing and spinning as though plagued by a swarm of invisible bees, each member switching instruments between - and often during - songs. As well as guitars, they played steel drums, xylophones and even a hurdy gurdy. Frontman Win Butler made frequent excursions into the audience and, during the song Flashbulb Eyes, plucked a camera from a press photographer and carried it on stage to capture the band's performance. The set list was evenly spread across their four albums, with highlights including No Cars Go, Neighborhood #1 (Tunnels) and Rebellion (Lies). The group's recurring subject matter of suburban despair and alienation might have seemed like an odd fit for Glastonbury's peace and love ethos, but there is an optimism and belief in humanity at the core of their music. Plus, they have really catchy choruses. The band's willingness to embrace all walks of life was displayed on Friday night during the song We Exist - about a teenager whose father struggles to accept his sexuality.

What is the difference between a revolution and a protest","This revolution is the result of someone sending a Facebook invitation to many people. I got it like other people on our network. The buzz around it was then created on different social media websites and with videos. I was here on 25 January when riot police forced us out and by the 28th, we were back following the violence. I've been sleeping here most of the time since. Our social network was established in 2005, when there was a democratic opening around the time of the presidential elections. People from different backgrounds all met through blogging and hoped to use technology for social change. It meant we have all gained good contacts, experience and strong networks. I like to think the social network is the people itself. Things like Facebook, Twitter, SMS and phones are just social tools. When they blocked Facebook and shut down technology, our network still operated because it's about people. Internet activists are also people and a lot of our organising, social work and relationships are developed offline. This is something that people dreamt of but didn't anticipate happening in reality. If anything, it shows that all the effort we put in over the past few years has not been wasted. It has climaxed into this critical mass of people you see in the square. At the moment I'm not getting a lot of internet connection. I'm trying not to drain my phone battery. We're still using it to distribute footage people are bringing to us that we've sorted through. I hope the internet will continue to play a complementary role in activism. At the moment we physically exist in downtown Cairo and I hope that when we have finished this sit-in, we will have won the right to organise ourselves outside the internet. Twitter: Amr Gharbeia I was involved in this revolution from the first day, 25 January, and I've now been spending my nights here for a while. For the past five years, I was very active online, blogging and tweeting. As we live under emergency laws in Egypt it has been very difficult to meet or communicate except on the internet. I'd never been part of a demonstration on the ground. At first we were mocking the event on 25 January. We questioned whether it was really possible to have a ""Facebook revolution"". I came on the 25th because I felt it was my duty as a citizen and I couldn't believe how it turned into something so different from what we've seen before. I was walking among the people and weeping. Now I sometimes just tweet to update people about what's going on or to call for a million-man demonstration or a day to remember our martyrs. I'm well-known among bloggers for my long articles and constant tweets, but once I was here I stopped communicating this way so much. I felt it was totally different to have real freedom rather than just hypothetical freedom or internet freedom. Blogging and tweeting has been important as we were building our minds.

openai_curie,A Chinese woman who had plastic surgery to make her face smaller was divorced by her husband because he disliked the shape of her face.,"Though the unverified story was short on details, and did not have the husband's side of the story, ""divorced because of fat face"" quickly became a top trend on microblogging network Weibo. State media picked up the story on Thursday, which was first reported in a local evening paper earlier this week. Liaoshen Wanbao reported the 49-year-old woman in Shenyang city had claimed her husband had divorced her 10 years ago because he disliked the shape of her face, said to be ""large and square"" with ""fat cheeks"". She said it spurred her to undergo facial surgery three times at a local hospital to shave her jawbones and reshape her face into a slimmer shape. During the third surgery the doctors discovered that if they proceeded further her nerves may be damaged, and halted the procedure. The woman, identified only by her surname Wang, later sued the hospital for 1.7 million yuan ($260,900; Â£183,900) in damages. She alleged the surgery had left her with soreness in her chin, and she could only eat and drink through a straw as ""when she exerted force on her lower jaw, she had the sensation that it would break"". The hospital, however, argued that the surgeries were conducted according to regulations, and pointed out that they encouraged her to seek psychiatric help instead of a third operation, which she refused. After mediation the woman agreed to accept 20,000 yuan ($3,100, Â£2,200) as compensation, said the report. On Weibo, some condemned the woman's husband, but others also chastised the woman. One top-voted comment read: ""It's purely an excuse, if her face was large then why did he decide to marry her in the first place? If he stopped loving her then he should have just said so."" It continued: ""This woman is also very silly to have believed that her face shape was the real reason for the divorce, she is lying to herself."" Said another Weibo user: ""Even if you had gone for facial surgery and made your face smaller, he would still have found other reasons to divorce you."" One person noted the sharp difference in the compensation amount and voiced suspicions: ""1.7 million was dropped to 20,000, it makes me wonder if she really did have a problem with her jaw."" Still others took the opportunity to crack jokes. ""What an odd reason for divorce! I wonder how square was this woman's square-shaped face? Like a television set? Microwave oven?"" Plastic surgery has long been a hot topic on Weibo. In December, users similarly expressed outrage when a Chinese man took out a newspaper advertisement pleading for his wife to go for plastic surgery.

openai_curie,"A European Citizens' Initiative has been launched to try to stop TTIP, a controversial trade deal between the EU and the US.","The petition calls on the EU and its member states to stop the talks on the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership or TTIP. It also says they should not ratify a similar deal that has already been done between the EU and Canada. It says some aspects pose a threat to democracy and the rule of law. One of the concerns mentioned in the petition is the idea of tribunals that foreign investors would be able to use in some circumstances to sue governments. There is a great deal of controversy over exactly what this system, known as Investor State Dispute Settlement, would enable companies to do, but campaigners see it as an opportunity for international business to get compensation for government policy changes that adversely affect them. This kind of provision exists in many bilateral trade and investment agreements. Friends of the Earth have published new research on the impact they have had on EU countries. Information about these cases is not always made public, but the group says that going back to 1994, foreign investors have sought compensation of almost €30bn (£24bn) from 20 states. Where the results are known (a small minority of the total), the tribunals have awarded total compensation of €3.5bn (about £2.8bn). In Britain, the possible implications of this provision for the National Health Service have been especially controversial. Campaigners believe that the investor tribunals would make it harder to reverse any decisions to contract services out to international healthcare firms. John Hilary of War on Want said: TTIP ""will make it impossible for any future government to repeal the Health & Social Care Act and bring the NHS back into public hands"". The petition lists a number of other areas where its signatories believes European standards would suffer if the TTIP negotiations are completed and the Canada deal is ratified: employment, social, environmental, privacy and consumer protection. The European Commission says the EU will not have to sacrifice its high standards. It also says investor protection provisions are important for investment flows and have in general worked well. But it accepts there is a need for improvement and is trying to achieve that in its bilateral negotiations. The petition has been organised as an exercise called a European Citizens' Initiative which can lead to a public hearing in the European Parliament and require the European Commission to give a formal response explaining why it is accepting or rejecting what the petitioners call for. The European Commission has already said that the petition doesn't qualify as such an Initiative. Campaigners have launched a legal challenge to this decision.",1,4,3

But UKIP chairman Paul Oakden said the letter did not follow proper process. A UKIP assembly group spokesman said the letter was written by a group with a ""long-standing grudge"" against the AM. The ruling NEC body discussed the issue at a meeting on Friday, where they also decided to allow a controversial anti-Islam campaigner to run for the UKIP leadership. Mr Oakden said: ""A member of the NEC had contacted the person that is putting this forward and said to them they need to follow the proper process of completing the necessary forms and submitting them to the NEC. ""Members simply emailing the NEC saying we want you to do this is not the correct disciplinary process for the party, by any stretch of the imagination. ""A member of the NEC has gone back and given advice on what they need to do."" Shaun Owen, secretary of UKIP's Delyn branch, wrote to the NEC saying: ""For some time we have been appalled by the abrasive and discourteous manner of Ms Brown towards UKIP locally. ""Her lack of effort in pursuing the aims of the party both locally and nationally is of concern to members across the region."" Mr Owen added he believed members would stop supporting UKIP if Ms Brown remained in the role. However, a spokesman for the party's assembly group dismissed the letter as written by a ""tiny and insignificant group"". In February, Ms Brown denied an allegation she had smoked recreational drugs in a hotel room. Later that month, she said she had acted ""with propriety"" after it was revealed she had discussed how an advert for a job in her assembly office could be changed to help her brother get an interview for the post.

""We are deeply ashamed of our cat, especially as he had convinced us that he had changed his criminal ways,"" his owner wrote to neighbours. Rachael Drouet created a leaflet for her neighbours in a bid to reunite the stolen items with their rightful owners. ""This year has been relatively quiet, save for some Bettaware catalogues and the odd flat balloon,"" the leaflet read. ""Until a few days ago when he started bring home toy food. ""So far we have cheese, a green pepper, fish, a pineapple, an aubergine, and a felt basket to put them all in."" Theo, a five-year-old Siamese cross, also managed to bring home a child's body warmer. Earlier this year, he stole a catalogue from a house down the street owned by a policeman, which Ms Drouet said ""wasn't ideal"". Among the items stolen in the last couple of years are muslin cloths, fluffy pens, a USB phone charger cable and a child's piece of art. Theo also took to stealing Christmas decorations from neighbours' trees. Ms Drouet said this year she managed to reunite items from Theo's haul with their rightful owners before too long. ""I wrote the flyers and then luckily managed to find out who all the things belonged to,"" Ms Drouet said. ""You get tired of knocking on neighbours' doors and saying 'me again'"".",1,5,4
openai_curie,"A church in North Yorkshire is struggling to get rid of bats after it spent Â£10,000 trying to get them to move out.","A colony has been roosting in St Hilda's Church at Ellerburn, close to the North York Moors. But despite the church's best efforts the bats are not moving and are soiling the altar and church furniture, leaving the church with an ""appalling smell"". The creatures are protected by law and cannot be wilfully disturbed. Volunteers at the church have been working for the past decade to keep the altar, stonework and woodwork clean. But the bats, roosting in the higher areas of the church continually soil the interior of the building with urine and faeces. Church warden Liz Cowley said keeping the 11th Century building in good shape was difficult. She said: ""You can see the urine marks (on the altar), they won't go away. ""If people were coming in here damaging an ancient building like this, you would say it was criminal damage. ""The smell is appalling, it's a combination of ammonia from the urine and a musty smell from the droppings that catches at the back of the throat."" Members of the church had spent Â£10,000 trying to get the bats to move and had paid for specially-built lofts nearby. The Rev Paul Mothersdale, the Rector of St Hilda's Church, said a lot of money had been invested in trying to persuade the bats to move out of the church. The Rev Mothersdale said: ""We've tried to do everything that English Nature, or Natural England, have wanted us to do. ""Money has been spent, not only by the congregation, not only out of church funds, but local people have mucked in and helped. ""And yet we're no further forward, we're still as we were 10 years ago."" Lucy Bellini, of Natural England, said the bats had to be carefully monitored. Ms Bellini said: ""It is a really regionally important roost. ""Because of that we need to be sure that there are replacement roosts that are suitable and that the bats have found and are aware of and can move to before we allow the church to seal up access points and move the bats out of the church.""",1,4,4
openai_curie,A company has been granted permission to drill for oil and gas in a field in north Wales.,"Plans were approved for Coastal Oil and Gas Limited to drill in a field at St Nicholas. The permit does not allow the company to carry out fracking - hydraulic fracturing of the land - to extract any oil or gas. Fracking is subject to a temporary ban in Wales until decision-making powers on the practice are devolved. Natural Resources Wales said it had carried out a ""thorough assessment"" of the company's plans before approving them, with all work including reinstatement of the land to be completed within 12 months. ""It's important that any activity of this kind doesn't harm the environment, and this permit makes it clear what Coastal Oil and Gas Limited will need to do to comply with this,"" a spokesman said. ""Once the work begins, our officers will regulate and monitor the site to ensure it complies with the conditions of the permit, to protect people and the environment."" The permit for exploratory drilling comes despite a moratorium on fracking in Wales pending devolution of responsibility for such decisions. In August, the UK government urged councils in England to speed up the process of approval for fracking projects. However, Natural Resources Minister Carl Sargeant said fracking technology was ""unproven"", and that Welsh Labour ministers preferred to look at renewable energy.",1,5,3
openai_curie,"A coroner has said he is ""disappointed"" that the inquest into the Kingsmill massacre has been delayed.","Republicans ambushed a mini-bus carrying the men at Kingsmill in County Armagh in 1976 and murdered them after checking what religion they were. Senior coroner John Leckey is retiring this year and told a preliminary hearing of the inquest in Belfast that no replacement has been appointed. His retirement could leave only one coroner in Northern Ireland. Kingsmill is among dozens of inquests dating from the early days of the Troubles that face delay because not enough money is available to investigate or there is nobody to oversee fresh hearings. Mr Leckey said: ""I feel for the bereaved families, not exclusively Kingsmill but for other inquests I am involved in. ""It is a disappointment that is widespread."" A lawyer for some of the Kingsmill victims' families said they would be pressing Stormont's justice department for more resources to allow an inquest to go ahead. Karen Armstrong, a sister of one of the murdered men, said the lack of resources was ""a political problem"". ""We are not going to lie down and accept it,"" she said. ""We will fight until we get another date and they have to make sure there are enough coroners in Northern Ireland to deal with our and many other cases."" Ulster Unionist MLA Danny Kennedy said he would be asking Justice Minister David Ford to ensure the matter was referred to the relevant authorities so that ""action can be taken as soon as possible"". ""Justice has been denied for almost 40 years and it is totally unacceptable that this inquest should be delayed further due to the unavailability of a coroner,"" he said. ""This was one of the most shocking and cruel events of the Troubles and the inquest must be treated with the seriousness this crime merits."" A Department of Justice spokesman said: ""Officials are actively working to ensure that all necessary resources are provided for the conduct of inquests in Northern Ireland. ""There are currently three full-time coroners in Northern Ireland. In addition, one High Court judge and one County Court judge have also been appointed as coroners.""",1,4,2
openai_curie,A council has been criticised for allowing senior staff to move into a derelict site in Norwich without proper planning permission.,"In 2008, elderly residents were moved out of Greyhound Opening in Norwich and senior city council officers moved in. The council's head of neighbourhood and strategic housing, Kristine Reeves, was later sacked over the affair. The development proposals, put forward by Norwich City Council, include 60 flats and 45 houses. The report to the council says 35 of the houses and flats will be for social rent. A report to Norwich City Council's planning committee, which meets on Thursday, advises councillors to approve the plans. Elderly residents were moved out of Greyhound Opening and nearby Goldsmith Street seven years ago after Norwich City Council agreed to redevelop the site. The council agreed that new employees relocating to the city could move in temporarily ahead of demolition. However other staff, including Ms Reeves, also moved in, in contravention of council policy. The council resisted calls for a full independent inquiry. Its own investigation found safeguards covering conflicts of interest were in place but not followed. In February 2009, London-based architects Riches Hawley Mikhail won a competition to design a new social housing development on the site, but they were never commissioned. During that year homes on the derelict site were demolished, but the site has since remained untouched.",1,3,3

The council said it would bring staff in line with the other 17,000 workers and ""reduce the risk"" of staff making claims for equal pay. Union Unison said it was ""bitterly disappointed"" with the decision. Regional officer, Helen Metcalf, said: ""This is a devastating blow for the 2,700 teaching assistants in the county, who now face being driven into poverty and relying on food banks through losing Â£200 - Â£400 per month of their salary."" She said there was ""no option"" but to lodge a formal dispute and ballot members for industrial action. Teaching assistant Tony Lowery, said: ""It is really devastating for my family because I'm the main wager. I don't mean things like going on holidays or a second car, I mean things like food on the table and clothes on our backs."" Liberal Democrat councillors voted unanimously against the plans. Councillor Owen Temple said the affected staff would ""find themselves the poorest teaching assistants in the North East"" and the council was ""very likely to face legal challenge"". The council's corporate director of resources, Don McLure, said there was a ""real risk"" that, under the present contracts, other council employees could make claims for equal pay with the teaching assistants. He said: ""I fully understand the position teaching assistants are in but they are very valued, they do a great job and support the education of our children, but we are doing this to bring them in line with the rest of our workforce."" He said two consultations with assistants and the unions had failed to find agreement but it was hoped further discussions would resolve the matter without strike action being taken.",1,3,2

openai_curie,A dissident republican arms dump was found in the Capanagh Forest near Larne.,"A ""terrorist hide"" was uncovered at Capanagh Forest near Larne after two members of the public found suspicious objects in the woods on Saturday. Some of the items found included an armour-piercing improvised rocket and two anti-personnel mines. The main line of police inquiry is the arms belonged to dissident republicans. Last week, Home Secretary Theresa May said MI5 believed an attack on targets in Great Britain by dissident republicans had become ""a strong possibility"". Analysis: Vincent Kearney, BBC News NI's home affairs correspondent The discovery of what appears to be a second dissident republican arms dump near Larne within three months has left police baffled. Based on location alone, the analysis would be that the items found most likely belonged to loyalist paramilitaries. But the nature of what was found suggests otherwise and the finger of suspicion firmly in the direction of dissident republicans. Det Supt Kevin Geddes said the threat level in Northern Ireland from dissident republican groups remains ""severe"" and an attack is ""highly likely"". Police officers found three barrels hidden in holes in the forest. As well as rockets and mines, there were also several pipe bombs, assault rifle ammunition and parts to construct a ""substantial number of explosive devices"". Det Supt Geddes said the seizure was significant ""both in terms of its size and its capability"". ""A number of these devices were ready to be deployed,"" he added. ""This seizure has undoubtedly saved lives."" He said the type of weapons that had been found meant police would focus their investigation on dissident republicans. In March, an arms find was made at Carnfunnock Country Park near Larne, and police said the were investigating a connection between the two discoveries. ""There are links in terms of the general location and the manner and method of storage and packaging of these munitions,"" Det Supt Geddes said. He added that police are ""indebted"" to the two people who noticed the suspicious objects in the Capanagh Forest.",1,4,4

A dissident republican group, widely referred to as the new IRA, said it carried out the attack. The organisation said Mr Ismay was targeted for training officers at Maghaberry Prison near Lisburn, County Antrim. Sue McAllister, director general of the Northern Ireland Prison Service, spent time with the Ismay family on Wednesday. She said they were ""devastated and beyond shock at what's happened"". ""Like all of us, they thought that he was on the mend and was doing really well,"" said Mrs McAllister. ""We thought he would make a full recovery, we expected him to come back to work in due course, so we're all shocked, but particularly Sharon and her daughters."" Mrs McAllister condemned the behaviour of some paramilitary inmates at Maghaberry Prison, who reportedly cheered, smoked cigars and mocked wardens at the high-security jail when news of Mr Ismay's death filtered through. ""This was just unacceptable behaviour by a very small number of prisoners,"" said Mrs McAllister. ""My colleagues in Maghaberry dealt with it professionally, with great fortitude and with the courage they display on a daily basis."" She admitted she and her colleagues in the Prison Service felt ""very angry"" on hearing the reports of the celebrations in the exercise yard of the prison. ""We encounter challenging behaviour by a small number of prisoners every day, and we deal with it with great professionalism and we do not stoop to behaving that way in response,"" she added. A man appeared in court on Saturday charged in connection with the bomb attack on Mr Ismay. Det Ch Insp Richard Campbell said it was ""yet another difficult day for the Ismay family, his friends and colleagues as they struggle to come to terms with the events of the past 12 days"". He added: ""We have spoken to the family this morning and advised them of this development. ""We are also liaising with the Public Prosecution Service in relation to the individual who is currently charged with attempted murder and causing an explosion with intent to endanger life.""

He was also ordered to carry out 150 hours' unpaid work at Highbury Corner Magistrates' Court. District judge Susan Williams also ordered him to pay Â£145 in costs and charges. She said that, although Carlisle had made a ""positive contribution"" to others through football, she had to sentence him for the risk his ""erratic"" driving had created. ""If you are not in control of your vehicle in a road in central London you represent a danger to people,"" she said. At a hearing in March, the court heard Carlisle's Mercedes had been spotted ""swerving"" and ""almost mounting the pavement"" in Pentonville Road. After his arrest, the court heard, he refused to give a breath sample and demanded to speak to his solicitor. Lisa Judge, defending, said he allowed the matter to ""escalate out of all control"" and ""unfortunately"" believed he had the right to see a lawyer, instead of being breathalysed. Carlisle has revealed he attempted to take his own life two days afterwards, when he was hit by a lorry on the A64 near York. Miss Judge described the arrest as having happened while he was ""in an extremely dark place in terms of his own life"". Carlisle is now so sorry about what happened that the court-ordered medical report on him ""utterly oozes remorse"", Miss Judge said. The court was told Carlisle had been involved in ""excess drinking offences"" in 1999 and 2011.

She will take on a new role on the clinic's Northern Ireland advisory board. Last November, anti-abortion protester Bernadette Smyth, who leads the Precious Life group, was convicted of harassing Ms Purvis at the Marie Stopes office in Belfast city centre. Ms Purvis told the BBC that had had no influence on her decision to step down. ""I think the clinic's well established here now, we're providing services more and more every year and I'm delighted to be remaining on the advisory board for the clinic. ""But I feel it's time to move on and I think it's time for Marie Stopes to get someone else in to manage the clinic and take it to new places,"" she said. ""At times it was difficult, particularly last year with the court case and the harassment, but I put that behind me and have concentrated on delivering services for women in Ireland both north and south. ""I think I've achieved a significant historical change in the perception of abortion in Northern Ireland from where the usual narrative was that abortion was illegal in Northern Ireland to now one where people understand that abortion is legal under certain circumstances. ""I think we've challenged the myths and stereotypes that are presented by those who are opposed to a woman's right to chose."" Genevieve Edwards, director of policy for Marie Stopes UK, said: ""We were so lucky to have Dawn and wish her every success in whatever she chooses to do.

Mr Wilson said it was ""not a colour issue"" but an ""economic judgement"". Speaking to BBC Asian Network, Mr Wilson, who has amassed nearly 1,000 buy-to-let properties in Kent, said a property he had bought from an Indian couple cost him about Â£12,000 because the curry smell became a ""massive problem"" and he was forced to rip up the carpet and take the house off the market for six months.

The Equality and Human Rights Commission is investigating and says it will seek legal action where necessary. Ms Hilsenrath said: ""There are still deep inequalities in our society as our race report demonstrated and these comments show why. ""As a country we all assume we have left the dark ages behind, but clearly there is more to be done. ""We will investigate and will be asking Mr Wilson to explain his actions. Unless we are satisfied that he will not break the law in the future we will take legal action"". Kent Police also said it was working to establish if any offences had taken place.

openai_curie,A planned road tunnel could damage a prehistoric site at Stonehenge.,"The shelter - in a hollow left behind by a fallen tree - at Blick Mead was used over a 90-year period from 4336 BC, it is believed. Archaeologist David Jacques, said: ""They... used the stump of the tree, about three metres high, as a wall."" The finds are being shown to United Nations heritage experts, who are currently visiting Stonehenge. Archaeologists are concerned a planned 2.9km tunnel being considered for the nearby A303 main road will damage the site. Discoveries have also shown stones were warmed up by the Mesolithic Period inhabitants and used in a hearth to emit heat in the earthy snug. Mr Jacques, a senior research fellow at the University of Buckingham, has worked at Blick Mead for over a decade, making a number of discoveries about the inhabitants. The tree stump created a wall height similar to a ""modern bungalow"". ""They've draped probably animal skins or thatch around the basin and connected it to a post so it's a very comfortable snug little place,"" he said. The wooden wall of the hollow was lined with flints and the large earthy pit created by the tree root lined with cobbles and decorated with ""exotic"" stones from outside the area. ""There are some clever and sophisticated things going on, the hot stones that they put into this little type of alcove wouldn't have been on fire,"" explained Mr Jacques. ""It looks more like these people have been using these hot stones as a type of storage heater so that you've got a lot of warmth coming off them."" Mr Jacques will meet the UN experts later to ask for the route to be moved closer to Salisbury and for hydrological assessments to be made. ""It's very likely the water flow would be reduced in and around the site,"" he said. ""It would take out all the organics and destroy all the animal bone we've been finding which is crucial for finding where they have been living and for getting radiocarbon dates from all the organics like pollen and wood. ""This is massively important for reconstructing what the landscape would have looked like."" Andy Rhind-Tutt, former mayor and chairman of Amesbury Museum and Heritage Trust said: ""I sincerely hope the team delivering the long-awaited A303 improvement look seriously at an alternative alignment south of Salisbury and away from this unequalled archaeological landscape. ""It would be criminal to destroy such a rich heritage and connection with our ancestors for the sake of blocking the view to the passing public of Stonehenge.""",1,5,4
openai_curie,A quarter of children in care are already living with their tenth family.,"Research carried out by the Fostering Network suggests almost half of fostered young people are already living with their third foster family since going into care. The group has warned that 750 more foster carers are ""urgently"" needed to meet the demands of the care system. It urged people to ""open their hearts and homes"" to vulnerable youngsters. Currently, more than 5,500 children are in foster care in Scotland, living with 4,400 families and carers. The Fostering Network surveyed 250 children, teenagers and foster carers across Scotland and discovered that many young people had failed to find stability. Almost half were already living with their third family, a quarter were with their fourth family and about 20 were living with their 10th family since going into care. There was a particular need for homes to be found for vulnerable teenagers, siblings and disabled children, the study found. Carla, 23, was taken into care at the age of 12 and had eight foster homes before moving in with the Randalls. ""Looking back now I realised that the Randalls saved my life,"" she said. ""I never understood the extent of the neglect and abuse I had endured until I came to live with a 'normal' loving family. ""They were just always themselves, the smallest details meant so much to me. ""They nurtured a young, angry, untrusting teenager to become a positive, empathetic and successful young woman."" The Fostering Network said instability had a detrimental effect on the child's education and wellbeing, while finding a stable foster carer from the outset could lead to improved relationships and a happier childhood. Sara Lurie, director of the Fostering Network Scotland, said: ""As each year passes, we see more and more children coming into care. ""We need people who can open their heart, and their homes, to vulnerable children and young people and use their skills to help support them to reach their full potential. ""In particular we need people who have the skills, patience and passion to look after teenagers who may have had a really tough time and be facing some real challenges, and to offer them love, stability and security. ""A good foster carer will believe in the ambition of the children in their care in the same way they'd believe in the ambition of their biological family members."" Apologies for the delay, see below as requested. A Scottish government spokeswoman said: ""Giving young people security is paramount and we have done a great deal of work with our partners across local government and the third sector to improve how we intervene early when there is a problem within families to find appropriate solutions quickly. ""We have also expanded the age at which young people can remain in foster care as part of the continuing care provisions and the support available when they transition into independent living.""",0,4,2

openai_curie,A tunnel under Stonehenge could destroy the site's ancient history.,"David Jacques, from the University of Buckingham, made the discovery at Blick Mead in October, and said the carbon dating results had just been confirmed. But he also raised concerns about possible damage to the site over plans to build a road tunnel past Stonehenge. The Department of Transport said it would ""consult before any building"". The Blick Mead site is about 1.5 miles (2.4km) from Stonehenge and archaeologists said ""scientifically tested charcoal"" dug up from the site had ""revealed that it dated from around 4000 BC"". David Jacques said the dig had also found ""evidence of feasting"" including burnt flints, tools and remains of giant cattle, known as aurochs, which were eaten by early hunter gatherers. Mr Jacques said: ""British pre-history may have to be rewritten. This is the latest dated Mesolithic encampment ever found in the UK. ""Blick Mead site connects the early hunter gatherer groups returning to Britain after the Ice Age to the Stonehenge area, all the way through to the Neolithic in the late 5th Millennium BC. ""But our only chance to find out about the earliest chapter of Britain's history could be wrecked if the tunnel goes ahead."" Andy Rhind-Tutt, a former mayor and current chairman of Amesbury Museum, which part-funded the dig, said the discovery could ""provide what archaeologists have been searching for centuries - the answer to the story of the pre-history of Stonehenge."" Earlier this month, the government announced funding for a 1.8-mile (2.9km) tunnel to remove congestion from the main road past Stonehenge. A Department for Transport spokesman said: ""As with any road scheme, we will consult with interested parties before any building begins on the A303.

openai_curie,A writer-activist in Kerala has been arrested for allegedly insulting the national anthem.,"Kamal C Chavara was detained by the police in Kerala state on Sunday after the youth wing of the Hindu nationalist BJP lodged a complaint against him. Last month, the Supreme Court ruled that the anthem must be played in every cinema before a film is screened. Some 20 people have been held in Kerala and Tamil Nadu since then for remaining seated during the anthem. Also, India's colonial-era sedition law has been often used against students, journalists, writers and social activists and those critical of the government. Reports said that the BJP's youth wing lodged a complaint against a Facebook post by Mr Chavara which allegedly insulted the anthem. The post was apparently an excerpt from one of his books. Senior police official Sateesh Bino told the NDTV news channel that the writer-activist ""is being questioned for his controversial post on the national anthem on Facebook"" and had been charged with sedition. Earlier this month, 12 people were arrested at a cinema in Kerala, after they remained seated while the national anthem played. The cinemagoers, who were attending an international film festival, were later freed but they face charges of ""failure to obey an order issued by a public servant, thereby causing obstruction or annoyance to others"". And at a cinema in Chennai, eight people who did not stand for the anthem were assaulted and abused, police said. The eight were later charged with showing disrespect to the anthem.",1,5,4

Brazil's Joao Gomes Junior took silver and South African Cameron van der Burgh was third. ""I'm feeling very good. I'm so, so happy with my displays,"" Peaty said. He was speaking to the BBC after taking part in the 4x100m mixed medley relay final, in which defending champions Britain finished fifth. USA won in a world record time of three minutes 38.56 seconds. Australia took silver, with China and Canada in joint third. It was a different story in his individual race, earlier. Peaty was level with his rivals in the first few strokes before he pulled away after 30 metres. The City of Derby swimmer appeared set to break the world record for a third time in two days, but narrowly fell short. The Briton suggested ""equilibrium"" was key to his successes.

Karen Pickering, British 2001 world 4x200m freestyle gold medallist We all know how strong Peaty is. In his semi-final he was a little bit lower in the water as he set his world record. Because he's not quite as high as he is in the 100m, he has a quicker turnover. He can keep that up for 50m, but not for a 100m - that's why he went to 25.95 seconds. You couldn't do that in the 100m because of the build-up of lactic acid. But because it's Adam Peaty, he might be able to manage that in a year.

openai_curie,An Egyptian blogger says he stopped blogging and tweeting because he was too busy being a protester.,"This revolution is the result of someone sending a Facebook invitation to many people. I got it like other people on our network. The buzz around it was then created on different social media websites and with videos. I was here on 25 January when riot police forced us out and by the 28th, we were back following the violence. I've been sleeping here most of the time since. Our social network was established in 2005, when there was a democratic opening around the time of the presidential elections. People from different backgrounds all met through blogging and hoped to use technology for social change. It meant we have all gained good contacts, experience and strong networks. I like to think the social network is the people itself. Things like Facebook, Twitter, SMS and phones are just social tools. When they blocked Facebook and shut down technology, our network still operated because it's about people. Internet activists are also people and a lot of our organising, social work and relationships are developed offline. This is something that people dreamt of but didn't anticipate happening in reality. If anything, it shows that all the effort we put in over the past few years has not been wasted. It has climaxed into this critical mass of people you see in the square. At the moment I'm not getting a lot of internet connection. I'm trying not to drain my phone battery. We're still using it to distribute footage people are bringing to us that we've sorted through. I hope the internet will continue to play a complementary role in activism. At the moment we physically exist in downtown Cairo and I hope that when we have finished this sit-in, we will have won the right to organise ourselves outside the internet. Twitter: Amr Gharbeia I was involved in this revolution from the first day, 25 January, and I've now been spending my nights here for a while. For the past five years, I was very active online, blogging and tweeting. As we live under emergency laws in Egypt it has been very difficult to meet or communicate except on the internet. I'd never been part of a demonstration on the ground. At first we were mocking the event on 25 January. We questioned whether it was really possible to have a ""Facebook revolution"". I came on the 25th because I felt it was my duty as a citizen and I couldn't believe how it turned into something so different from what we've seen before. I was walking among the people and weeping. Now I sometimes just tweet to update people about what's going on or to call for a million-man demonstration or a day to remember our martyrs. I'm well-known among bloggers for my long articles and constant tweets, but once I was here I stopped communicating this way so much. I felt it was totally different to have real freedom rather than just hypothetical freedom or internet freedom. Blogging and tweeting has been important as we were building our minds.

""In a lifetime of pretty much impossible things that have happened to our band, this is the highlight,"" said frontman Win Butler. Earlier, every stage at the event was closed after lightning struck ground. Dance act Rudimental were escorted off the main stage mid-set, and had to abandon their planned encore - Feel The Love, with guest vocalist John Newman. ""We're quite upset,"" musician Amir Amor told the BBC, ""but we had a great time anyway"". Metallica's Lars Ulrich was flying into the site by helicopter as the storm descended. ""It was kind of frightening,"" he said. ""When we landed, all the people picking us up were going, 'we didn't expect you were going to fly in this weather'. ""But the pilot didn't say anything about that. We saw the lightning up there. I thought it was pyrotechnics for Arcade Fire."" The thunderstorm heralded a brief but torrential downpour, and the power cut took BBC coverage off the air. Music resumed on the main stage at 19:00 BST with Lily Allen, who dedicated an expletive-laden song to FIFA president Sepp Blatter. Other performers on Friday included Blondie, who proved so popular it became impossible to enter or leave The Other Stage at lunchtime, and Paolo Nutini, whose soulful ballads were a fitting soundtrack as dusk fell over Somerset. Sophie Ellis-Bextor sneaked some disco into her set at the largely-acoustic Avalon Stage, while the pulsing synthpop of Glaswegian band Chvrches made for a steamy atmosphere in the John Peel tent as fans danced off the downpour. Arcade Fire took to the stage shortly after 22:00 BST, their arrival heralded by a man dressed from head-to-toe in a mirrored suit. Bravely, considering the weather conditions, the 12-piece band were largely dressed in white, but if they were worried about laundry bills, it didn't show. They threw themselves around the stage, thrashing and spinning as though plagued by a swarm of invisible bees, each member switching instruments between - and often during - songs. As well as guitars, they played steel drums, xylophones and even a hurdy gurdy. Frontman Win Butler made frequent excursions into the audience and, during the song Flashbulb Eyes, plucked a camera from a press photographer and carried it on stage to capture the band's performance. The set list was evenly spread across their four albums, with highlights including No Cars Go, Neighborhood #1 (Tunnels) and Rebellion (Lies). The group's recurring subject matter of suburban despair and alienation might have seemed like an odd fit for Glastonbury's peace and love ethos, but there is an optimism and belief in humanity at the core of their music. Plus, they have really catchy choruses.

He admitted culpable homicide on the basis of diminished responsibility after saying he had no recollection of the killing at Dixon Avenue, Glasgow, on 24 September last year. Buksh will be sentenced on 27 June. The High Court in Glasgow heard that 43-year-old Mrs Buksh died after being struck on the head at least five times. Pathologists told the court that the lack of defensive injuries and the position of her body suggested she was assaulted as she slept. Following the attack, Buksh went to Cathcart Police Station and told an officer: ""I've come to hand myself in. I think my wife's dead. I hit her on the head. I did it."" The court was told that three psychiatrists described Buksh as suffering from an acute stress disorder at the time. Prosecutor Gordon Lamont said: ""The accused and his wife had been married for 25 years, but over the last 10 or 11 years their relationship appears to have broken down and they became increasingly estranged, albeit, still residing under the one roof. ""They slept separately and Mrs Buksh routinely slept on the sofa in the living room. Their children report that they barely spoke to each other."" Mr Lamont said the problems in the marriage intensified after Mrs Buksh went to Pakistan on holiday in May last year. He said she had become involved with another man and was making plans to move to Pakistan. The court also heard that two days before he killed his wife, Buksh went to Paisley Police Office and spoke with a support officer saying he feared his wife was going to take their youngest child, aged 10, to Pakistan and not return. He also made an emergency doctor's appointment and said he was suffering from stress and not sleeping. He was prescribed medication for stress. Defence counsel Sarah Livingstone said: ""My client has no memory of this incident. His amnesia is absolutely genuine. ""This is not a case where this man was a bad husband, there was no domestic abuse. This was an unhappy marriage, but however, unhappy it was it didn't justify killing his wife. ""He suffered an acute stress reaction. Three psychiatrists all agree that he was suffering from an abnormality of the mind."" Judge Lord Burns deferred sentence on Buksh until 27 June at the High Court in Edinburgh for background reports.",1,5,3
openai_curie,BHS is being sold to a consortium led by a retail veteran.,"BHS entered administration in April. Since then, efforts have been continuing to rescue it from closure and save the jobs of its 11,000 staff. Last week, a surprise late bid led by retail veteran Greg Tufnell transformed the race to acquire the retailer. His team, said to be backed by Portuguese money, is the front-runner. But if a deal cannot be struck, the business may still have to be liquidated. The remaining bidders have faded into the background. Another consortium led by Matalan tycoon John Hargreaves and Turkish retail entrepreneur Cafer Mahiroglu has reportedly run into difficulties, while other suitors have apparently failed to impress with their proposals. Some of those involved in the different bids have impressive retailing histories. But then Sir Philip Green, who controlled BHS from 2000 to 2015, also had a brilliant track record. And he ended up selling the business for Â£1. So what are the chances of saving BHS from the liquidators? And just who are the people aiming to do it? In the public eye, Greg Tufnell is easily overshadowed by his more famous brother Phil, the former England cricketer. But that could change if his bid for BHS is successful, because he hopes to become the firm's next chairman. And as far as his credentials for the job are concerned, the 54-year-old executive certainly talks the talk. He describes himself as ""a highly experienced managing director with Mothercare and Arcadia, a blend of entrepreneur, strategist and hands-on operator with significant commercial business turnaround, acquisition and fund-raising experience"". His record shows that he was buying and merchandising director at Next from 1991 to 1994. He then spent three years as managing director of menswear retailer Burton, part of the Arcadia group, followed by another three years as managing director of Mothercare. He currently appears to occupy a portfolio of different jobs, including the chairmanships of leather accessories brand Zatchels and recruitment consultancy hga Group. Earlier this month, he registered a new firm, Richess Group, at Companies House. Its other directors are Nick de Scossa, a Swiss banker, and Lisbon-based entrepreneur Jose Maria Soares Bento. Until Mr Tufnell's bid turned up, many observers had assumed that BHS would be snapped up by Matalan founder Mr Hargreaves. But it appears that the cost of a deal may have proved too high. Sources say Mr Hargreaves was asked to improve his offer and balked. Like Sir Philip Green, 71-year-old John Hargreaves also enjoys the life of the super-rich. He has an estimated fortune of Â£1bn, according to the Sunday Times Rich List. But in stark contrast to the ebullient Sir Philip, Mr Hargreaves is described by industry insiders as quiet-spoken, someone who shuns the limelight. Mr Hargreaves is no longer directly involved in the business he founded. He sold his 69% stake in Matalan in 2000, then in 2006 took it private through Missouri Bidco, a company 53.5% owned by him and his family. As a partner in Mr Hargreaves' bid, there is also Cafer Mahiroglu, the owner of Select Fashions. At 50, he is the youngest of",1,3,2

The city was rocked by riots in April when a black man died after suffering injuries in police custody. Six officers were charged over the death of the 25-year-old, Freddie Gray. Speaking at a news conference on Wednesday, Mayor Rawlings-Blake said Mr Batts had ""served this city with distinction"" since becoming police chief in October 2012. But referring to the city's high homicide rate, she said ""too many continue to die"". ""The focus has been too much on the leadership of the department and not enough on the crime fighting,"" she told reporters, adding: ""We need to get the crime surge under control."" The city has seen a sharp increase in violence since Freddie Gray's death on 19 April, with 155 homicides this year, a 48% increase over the same period last year. On Tuesday, the police department announced that an outside organisation will review its response to the civil unrest that followed Mr Gray's death. The US justice department is also conducting a civil rights review of the Baltimore force and Mr Batts has been criticised by the city's police union. Earlier on Wednesday, the union released its report into the police handling of the rioting. It said officers had complained ""that they lacked basic riot equipment, training, and, as events unfolded, direction from leadership"". The report also said ""officers repeatedly expressed concern that the passive response to the civil unrest had allowed the disorder to grow into full scale rioting"".

""And then we will send that equipment to Houston where we will finish rehearsals. Fans can expect a performance that spans my career so far."" She has a high standard to live up to - notably Prince's show in 2007, which took place in the middle of a Miami thunderstorm and is widely accepted as the greatest performance in the event's history, if not Prince's career. Here are some of the other most memorable - and surprising - moments from the last 30 years. Super Bowl performers get a very strict 12-minute time limit, so most performers cram their set with as much music as possible. Not Michael Jackson. After shooting onto the stage at the Pasadena Rose Bowl, he stood completely still, staring at the world for a full 90 seconds. Ninety. It was a master class in ratcheting expectation to a fever pitch. And the screams when he launched into Jam (not one of his best songs) proved he knew what he was doing. Brilliantly, Jackson staged this entire performance while wearing a jacket it looked like he'd borrowed from Muammar Gaddafi. Beat that, Gaga. Baby, he was born to run... and slide on his knees... and crotch slam a TV camera. In his autobiography, The Boss explains the incident like this: ""Too much adrenalin, a late drop, too much speed, here I come, Mikeâ€¦ BOOM! ""And I'm onto his camera, the lens implanted into my chest with one leg off the stage. I use his camera to push myself back up andâ€¦ BLAM! BORN TO RUN!"" It led to the memorable headline: ""America Attacked by Bruce Springsteen's crotch"" - but it didn't stop the star delivering one of the most powerful and energetic Super Bowl shows in recent history. Even if they were fined for over-running by 40 seconds. Coldplay were the headline act at last year's Super Bowl in Santa Clara - but someone forgot to tell Beyonce. She only performed one song, Formation, underscoring its message of black pride and power with back-up dancers dressed in leather body suits and black berets reminiscent of the Black Panthers movement. Some of her dancers were even pictured holding up a sign declaring ""Justice 4 Mario Woods"" - a 26-year-old black man who was shot dead by armed police in San Francisco two months earlier.

Read on. Profile: Boris Johnson How could 'zip wire prat' become prime minister? Read more about the UK's referendum on the EU Alexander Boris de Pfeffel Johnson, to give him his full name, was born in New York and is descended from Turkish, French and German stock. He describes himself as a ""one-man melting pot"". He first made a name for himself in journalism, including a stint as Brussels correspondent for the right-wing Daily Telegraph newspaper and editor of The Spectator magazine. His humorous persona led him to become a fixture on various television programmes, including the satirical BBC panel show Have I Got News For You. He still has a lucrative and entertaining column in the Daily Telegraph, in which august forum he explained the reasons for his decision on the EU. As a politician, he has been a Conservative member of parliament for two constituencies, Henley from 2001 to 2008 and then Uxbridge and South Ruislip from 2015. Lest you think he was putting his feet up between parliamentary mandates, he is also currently serving the second of two terms as mayor of London, no mean feat in a city where the centre-left Labour Party has dominated in recent decades. That's indicative of the position Mr Johnson has carved out for himself as one of the most charismatic politicians in the UK who has wide appeal beyond Conservative heartlands - polling has suggested that his stance on the EU referendum may sway some undecided voters. Just look what happens when you type his name into Google.co.uk. Not quite. He has previously courted controversy for his remarks about (among others) the populations of Liverpool, Portsmouth and Papua New Guinea, not to mention run-ins with his own party leadership and TV chef Jamie Oliver. Last October he accidentally flattened a 10-year-old schoolboy at what was meant to be a friendly game of photo-op rugby in Japan. But none of this seems to have affected his standing among the party faithful or the public at large. Even getting stuck on a zip-wire during the London Olympics in 2012, a sure-fire route to derision for any other politician, only enhanced his eccentric image.

The apes began to disappear from the documents about 150 years ago, corresponding with population growth. The study is published in the Proceedings of the Royal Society B. Hainan gibbons are now limited to a few isolated patches of forest in the south west of China. They live in just four social groups, one of which was only discovered a few weeks ago. Understanding this population crash has been difficult, but the old government documents have helped to reveal when and how the numbers fell. Dr Sam Turvey, from the Zoological Society of London, said: ""China is one of the few places in the world that has a very very rich, long historical record. ""Because it has had such a complex bureaucracy for so long, there has been a lot of need for reporting - not just numbers of households for tax purposes and things like that, but also in terms of the kinds of natural resources that were available in the immediate environment."" These included records of animals, including gibbons, he said. ""We looked at the pattern of disappearance of gibbons through time and how that varied from place to place and the different environmental conditions and human pressures that were also present in these places."" The archives show that gibbons were a common sight in about 20 provinces in China well into the 17th and 18th Century. However, Dr Turvey said it was ""a stark contrast to their very imperilled position today"". ""We see a really steep increase in population decline and real population collapse across China about 100-150 years ago,"" he added. ""And this correlates with demographic expansion in China towards the end of the Imperial era and through the 20th Century, and the massive increase in deforestation and human population growth through the time of the Chinese Republic and the establishment of the communist party."" The researchers said a better understanding of the animals' decline would help them to establish a conservation plan for the country's last few Hainan gibbons. Dr Turvey said: ""It is an incredible privilege to be able to see gibbons in China in the wild.

Freezing care provider fees to save money was no long sustainable, it said. Ministers say extra money will help NHS and social care services work together. The survey, which was completed by 147 directors of adult social services for councils in England, suggests that funding reductions to social care budgets have totalled £4.6bn since 2010 - a 31% overall reduction. Budgets for adult social care - which provides practical support to people due to illness, disability, old age or a low income - will reduce by a further £500m in cash terms this year, it said. ""Taking the growth in numbers of older and disabled people into account, this means that an additional £1.1bn would be needed to provide the same level of service as last year,"" the report warned. It said some councils had made savings in the past by freezing fees paid to providers, but care providers were now also facing financial problems. Some companies - particularly those in southern England - are struggling to attract staff, amid increasing concern about the quality of care, it said. ""What is at stake is the continuing capacity of adult social care to sustain services to those in greatest need,"" ADASS president Ray James said. ""In virtually all our authorities, the number in need is growing, while the complexity of their needs is increasing."" ADASS called for the government to ""protect essential care and support services to the most vulnerable members of our community"".

The BBC has launched an online guide to the care system for the over-65s. The ""care calculator"" covers residential care and the support provided in people's own homes, for tasks such as washing and dressing. Users can submit their postcode and find out how much each service costs where they live in the UK. There is also a dedicated BBC Cost of Care website, with news stories, analysis and video. The spokesman said: ""Increasing budgets isn't the only solution. By working innovatively and joining up health and social care we can improve care and also save money."" However, Councillor Izzi Seccombe, from the Local Government Association (LGA), said adult social care services were facing ""enormous pressures"" due to ""insufficient funding, growing demand and escalating costs"". ""We have long warned that investing in the NHS whilst social care budgets are under continual pressure is simply a false economy. ""It is social care services that support elderly and vulnerable people to maintain their independence, live in their own community and stay out of hospital longer,"" she added. Caroline Abrahams, charity director at Age UK, said the idea of a further £1bn coming out of social care budgets was ""chilling"".

openai_curie,Eight Scottish councils will discuss plans for a range of infrastructure projects in their areas.,"They include a new water sports park, railway station and a sliproad from the M77. The City Deal scheme will see eight council areas around Glasgow receive about £1bn from the UK and Scottish governments. The councils also have the power to borrow extra cash. The Glasgow and Clyde Valley City Deal involved massive investment by both the Scottish and UK governments last year. Eight councils - Glasgow, East Renfrewshire, Renfrewshire, Inverclyde, North and South Lanarkshire and East and West Dunbartonshire - are involved. The City Deal scheme will see Westminster and Holyrood give £500m each in additional grant funding to the eight council areas. The councils will supplement this by borrowing £130m. Councillors from across all eight areas will meet to discuss some of the schemes. Several of the projects being discussed later are in East Renfrewshire, where £44m is expected to be invested over the next few years, with much of the money coming from the City Deal funding. One is a water sports park at the Dams to Darnley Country Park. It would open in 2017 and include a centre offering wakeboarding, the fastest-growing extreme sport in the world. A new railway station in Barrhead and sliproad from the M77 would serve an area which could become one of East Renfrewshire's fastest growth areas. The council expects 1,000 new homes to be built there. Another project would transform the Levern Works site in Barrhead. A site formerly occupied by Nestle, where pet food was once made, would be cleared. The site will then be marketed for development for a range of uses that will bring new jobs to Barrhead. A wide range of other infrastructure projects across the eight council areas will also be discussed.",1,4,4
openai_curie,"England were frustrated to come so close to victory in the second Test against Pakistan, but they will take heart from their performance in the first Test.","Pakistan seemed to be cruising to a draw before debutant Adil Rashid - who returned 0-163 in the first innings - turned the match with five wickets. Needing 99 to win, England sent out Jos Buttler and Ben Stokes in the top four. But they were eventually beaten by the fading light, finishing 25 runs short of a famous victory on 74-4. The tourists could not find the boundary frequently enough before the umpires brought the teams off, with Joe Root 33 not out. However, this was a hugely impressive performance from England and one that will fill them with confidence ahead of the second Test in Dubai, which begins on Thursday. After England concluded their innings on 598-9 in the morning, Pakistan looked assured at 113-3 shortly after tea, leading by 38 with seven second-innings wickets remaining. But the match turned when veteran batsman Younus Khan, playing in his 102nd Test match, mistimed a wild heave to give Rashid his first Test wicket - caught at point by Stokes. Rashid - whose figures in the first innings were the worst ever by a debutant - then quickly added a second victim, having Asad Shafiq caught behind for six. The door was opened for England, and Rashid and Moeen Ali barged through it as they polished off the last five wickets for 14 runs. Pakistan skipper Misbah ul-Haq - who had played with restraint for his 51 - inexplicably aimed an uncharacteristic slog at Moeen and was bowled. Moeen then removed Wahab Riaz caught behind, before Rashid claimed the final three wickets - all superbly caught at first slip by James Anderson. England sensed an unlikely victory, but their reorganised batting order could not score quickly enough as Pakistan's tactic of spin from both ends and fielders on the boundary brought them regular wickets. Makeshift opener Buttler was trapped lbw for four, Moeen and Stokes were caught on the boundary in quick succession, and Jonny Bairstow was stumped attempting a big shot. However, in truth it was mistakes earlier in the match that ultimately proved more costly as England fell just short of their first win on the subcontinent since beating India in Kolkata in 2012. In Pakistan's first innings, Ian Bell dropped Mohammad Hafeez (98) and Shafiq (107) at slip early in their innings. And Shoaib Malik, who made 245, was dismissed off a no-ball by Stuart Broad. England captain Alastair Cook, whose record-breaking 263 in the first innings was ultimately in vain, admitted England were frustrated to come so close to victory. ""We'd have liked another three or four overs at the end but that's the way it goes,"" he said. ""I can't fault the guys for hanging in there on that wicket. ""The pitch did deteriorate and spun more today which gave us hope, so it's a bit of a bittersweet finish. We knew we had to put the pressure on Pakistan and then on the last day you never know.

At least nine clinical commissioning groups","GP practices are being paid to help local NHS groups limit the number of patient referrals and cut costs, the doctors' magazine Pulse found. Appointments affected include scans and consultations with specialists - including those for cancer patients. The British Medical Association said such incentives were ""misguided"". At least nine clinical commissioning groups (CCGs) were offering GP practices payments for hitting targets, according to Pulse's investigation. In one case, Birmingham South Central CCG was offering practices more than Â£11,000 to reduce new outpatient attendances, follow-ups, A&E attendances and emergency admissions by 1%, compared with 2014/15. It said the schemes, which exclude cancer referrals, were designed to ""incentivise best quality practice"" and ""drive improvements in the quality of primary medical care"". ""Our priority is to ensure that patients have access to services that they need, when they need them,"" said a spokesperson for Birmingham South Central CCG. Another CCG told Pulse it had considered the ""full impact"" of the incentive scheme and was ""confident that there is no conflict of interest"". Pulse said that one scheme had already been looked at by the General Medical Council, the body which regulates medical standards in the UK, after local GP leaders expressed their concern. The magazine pointed out that initial hospital referrals for cancer patients should happen within two weeks of a GP first suspecting the condition. Dr Chand Nagpaul, chairman of the GPs committee of the doctors' trade union the British Medical Association, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that such schemes were a ""financial contaminant"" to patient-doctor trust. He said: ""It's short-sighted and misguided of CCGs to introduce such mechanisms, because they do lead to the potential for patients questioning the motives of GP referrals. ""We believe it is far more appropriate for CCGs to introduce clinical pathways that ensure patients are referred appropriately rather than these crude, salesman-like bonuses which pay GPs simply to make reduction to referrals in numerical terms."" Dr Peter Melton is local GP and clinical chief officer for North East Lincolnshire CCG, which offers the equivalent of more than Â£6,000 to practices that reduce outpatient referrals to the same level as the 25% with the lowest referral rates (which include two-week urgent cancer referrals) in 2014/15. He said the CCG was already among the best in England for referring suspected cancer patients to a consultant within two weeks and the scheme was not about avoiding sending people to hospital. ""It is not focussing on referral reduction per se but on better clinical and quality standards for the patient,"" he explained. ""The expectation is practices will be encouraged to investigate more locally and monitor the patient in the first instance rather than automatically refer in to a secondary care service."" Analysis by the BBC's Helen Briggs The NHS is under pressure to make savings, with a target of carving out Â£22bn of efficiency savings by 2020. NHS leaders want to cut patient referrals that are deemed inappropriate, particularly when patients could be cared for locally.

openai_curie,Guardiola has been criticised for his attitude towards his players after they lost to Chelsea.,"City are fourth in the league following defeat at Chelsea on Wednesday, all but ending hopes of a league title in the Catalan's debut campaign in England. ""In future I will be better - definitely,"" said the former Barcelona and Bayern Munich coach. ""This season has been a massive lesson for me."" He added: ""We have a lot of beautiful things to fight for and to qualify for the Champions League will be a huge success. But we have to be honest with ourselves. We were not good enough to compete for the Premier League [title]."" Defeat at Stamford Bridge left City just four points ahead of Arsenal and Manchester United, both of whom have a game in hand. With the FA Cup being City's only realistic chance of winning a trophy this term, it is likely to be the worst season of Guardiola's managerial career. The 46-year-old has never gone a single season without winning a trophy - he has won the title in six out of seven attempts and his sides have always reached the last four of the Champions League. Guardiola has also responded to questions about a row between City and Chelsea coaching staff at Stamford Bridge following the defeat on Wednesday night. There have been conflicting claims about the precise nature of the row, but stewards were needed to calm the situation down after Chelsea's 2-1 win. The incident centred around a disagreement between Chelsea fitness coach Paolo Bertelli and Manchester City masseur Mark Sertori, both of whom speak Italian, as the Premier League leaders celebrated their victory. Guardiola said: ""We are so polite in our defeats and we are so polite when we win. When we win, normally we celebrate a little bit, then we go to the locker room. Chelsea manager Antonio Conte was not involved and has played the incident down. He said: ""Respect is the most important thing in football.""",1,4,4
openai_curie,"Harper Lee, the author of To Kill a Mockingbird, has never explained why she stopped writing.","Harper Lee's classic was published 50 years ago this summer and it remains the only novel she ever wrote. Lee, 84, has never explained why she stopped writing. She doesn't give interviews - ""Hell, no"" was her response to a request several decades ago - and that silence has only added to the intrigue. But her close friend Thomas Lane Butts, a retired minister in her hometown, Monroeville, Alabama, says she once told him the reason. Sitting on a pew in the Methodist church which the Lee family still attends, he described to me how she suddenly brought the subject up one night over dinner in New York. ""She asked me, 'You ever wonder why I didn't write anything else?' And I said, 'Along with several million other people, yes, I had wondered about that.' And she said, 'Well, what do you think?'"" Speaking in his slow southern drawl, the Rev Butts, who just turned 80, suggested to her that she had already written a great book and therefore didn't need to compete with herself. ""And when I got through she said, 'You're all wrong.' I said, 'Alright, smart Alec. You tell me.' She said, 'I would not go through all the deprivation of privacy through which I went for this book again for any amount of money.' ""And she said, 'I did not need to write another book. I said what I wanted to say in that book.'"" Harper Lee called it a simple tale about the ""conflict of the human soul"" and Monroeville, Alabama, is where she drew her inspiration. The story depicts the segregated South of her childhood, during the Depression. It was published at the height of the civil rights struggle. The Rev Butts grew up 10 miles outside Monroeville. By the late 1950s, he says, he was a ""fuzzy-cheeked young preacher"" campaigning for an end to segregation. He had met Martin Luther King Jr and signed a petition to boycott buses. The Ku Klux Klan had left a burning cross on his front lawn. He says To Kill a Mockingbird was not well received in Monroeville when it was published. ""The people who were hard racist did not like it because of the implication of the book,"" the Rev Butts told me. ""The book revealed racism and that always frightens a racist - when you pull the cover off them. ""Those of us who stood up for civil rights were much encouraged by the book because in a very skilful and subtle way it addressed itself for justice."" But these days, the Rev Butts says, there is enormous civic pride in Monroeville. The old courthouse, which Hollywood re-created for the film, now houses a museum to Harper Lee and the town's other literary icon, Truman Capote. Capote was a childhood friend of hers and is thought to be the inspiration for the Dill character in To Kill a Mockingbird. The town's residents often try to protect Lee, allowing her to live a normal life instead of being hounded by fans or bothered with prying questions. ""Being famous",1,4,3
openai_curie,Hibs have appointed Neil Lennon as their new manager.,"His previous jobs were at Celtic and Bolton, but moving to the second tier of Scottish football was no hindrance to him returning to work at Easter Road. Lennon saw the vacancy as an opportunity, and that was enough to encourage Hibs that a figure of his profile and experience would accept a role in the Championship. Even though his last job in Scotland involved leading a team on Champions League duty, Lennon's mind has not been swayed by haughtiness. The appointment of the former Celtic manager as successor to Alan Stubbs suits both parties, because it is mutually beneficial. Success is alluring, and Hibs offer Lennon the chance to accumulate more achievements. He was immediately engaged in crisis management at his previous club Bolton, but will find stability, potential and accomplishment at Easter Road. The demand will be to deliver promotion, but that will not seem daunting when the majority of the squad that pushed Rangers for a while last season then won the Scottish Cup is still in place. Lennon's task is to refine and bolster the team, when new managers are often faced with a period of overhaul. Stubbs left the club on an emotional high after delivering their first Scottish Cup in 114 years, but before the final against Rangers there was a tangible sense of exasperation that promotion had been missed. Hibs were entitled to feel that it was an unnecessary failure given their circumstances. The club is about to embark on a third season in the Championship, but by most other measures they can be considered a top-flight outfit. The budget will be significantly more than the rest of the teams in the division, the training ground at East Mains and facilities are first-class, the football side of the business is stable and well-run by George Craig, the club's head of football operations, the squad is full of talent. Lennon can rely on consistently assured performances from the likes of David Gray, Darren McGregor, Paul Hanlon, Lewis Stevenson, John McGinn, Fraser Fyvie, Dylan McGeouch, James Keatings and Jason Cummings. Some minor issues remain, such as who will fill the goal next season, but the challenge is more on adding depth and strength of will to the squad and man-management. McGinn, one of the most reliably effective players in the Championship last season, has already insisted that he remains committed to Hibs despite the failure to achieve promotion. The 21-year-old midfielder provides the kind of industry and spirit that a team can be built around. There may be critical decisions to make, though, since Cummings is entering the final year of his contract and so represents a sellable asset. He is a regular goalscorer, though, and Stubbs had to sign Anthony Stokes on loan last January to provide some support up front. These are tweaks compared to the amount of work Stubbs had to carry out when he was appointed two years ago. Hibs are ready to be guided forward, not waiting to be rescued. When Lennon left Celtic two years ago, it was to pursue a",1,5,4

openai_curie,India's economy is slowing down and its credit rating is under threat.,"India's gross domestic product (GDP) grew by 5.3% in the quarter compared with a year earlier, data showed. That is down from 6.1% in the previous quarter. Analysts were expecting the same figure for January to March. India is the third-largest economy in Asia but has been struggling with inflation and currency weakness. Since July last year, the Indian rupee has seen one of the biggest declines among Asian currencies, dropping more than 27% against the US dollar. ""Shocking numbers as growth was even lower than lows witnessed during the financial crisis,"" said Anubhuti Sahay from Standard Chartered Bank in Mumbai. The BBC's Yogita Limaye in Mumbai said that just a year ago India was aspiring for double-digit growth. But a global slowdown has reduced external demand, and high inflation coupled with a weak rupee has made things more expensive within the country. Domestic demand, which India's economy is largely reliant on, has also slowed in part due to the political upheaval in the country. India's economy is suffering from ""policy incoherence, shifting global risk appetite and a comatose government"", said Rajeev Malik, senior economist at brokerage CLSA India's Prime Minister Manmohan Singh admitted early this month that his government must do more to get the once fast-growing economy moving again. The Congress-led coalition government is caught up in a slew of corruption scandals. Key policy reforms, including allowing foreign investment in India's retail sector, have been delayed in parliament for more than a year. This has worried foreign investors and threatened the country's investment grade credit rating. ""This is definitely a very important signal for the government - this is a make or break situation for India and the government has to step on the panic button,"" said Rupa Rege Nitsure, chief economist at Bank of Baroda in Mumbai. ""If the government doesn't step in now, India's sovereign ratings may be jeopardised.""",1,5,4
openai_curie,Inverness CT manager Richie Foran has said that his team need to show more passion and desire to stay in the Scottish Premiership.,"Steven Maclean bundled home the opener five minutes before half-time. The hosts, slacker after the break, had beleaguered striker Larnell Cole sent-off after he confronted the referee. Liam Craig sealed the win from the penalty spot with two minutes to play, before Graham Cummins finished a sumptuous stoppage-time move. And things got worse still for Caley Thistle after the match, with captain Gary Warren shown a red card in the tunnel. Saints remain five points clear of Hearts in fourth place, and closed the gap on third-placed Rangers, who play Aberdeen on Sunday, to three points. With game after game ticking past, Inverness' position looks increasingly perilous. Next weekend's trip to Motherwell, second-bottom on goal difference, is now seismic. This contest turned nightmarish for the hosts after a bright opening, but the truth is, given their predicament, Caley Thistle did not threaten St Johnstone's goal enough. Billy Mckay sent a shot over from close range. Alex Fisher nodded a diving header wide. Carl Tremarco miscued a volley. Greg Tansey did draw a save from Alan Mannus when he rasped in an effort from outside the box, but Richie Foran's side never looked likely to find the net. Their best opportunity came immediately after the Saints went ahead, when Tansey fed Cole, who seemed to panic in a terrific position and shot straight at Mannus. Cole's dismissal ended the contest when he appeared to be cautioned twice for challenging referee Stephen Finnie's decision not to award a foul. St Johnstone were merciless and could have had more. With just one win from their last 21 league games, Inverness look deep in trouble. Tommy Wright's side deserve so much credit. Saints were tactically brilliant, so strong defensively and ruthlessly capitalised on their man advantage. They took one of their few first-half chances when Michael Coulson broke down the left and sent a dangerous ball across the six-yard box. Owain Fon Williams could only parry into the danger area, Cummins' shot was blocked but Maclean followed up to force it home. They should have had another when Craig's superb curling corner flew all the way to the back post where Cummins slid in and somehow knocked it over from two yards. Craig, in his 300th appearance for the club, coolly converted a spot-kick after Cummins was tripped to seal the points. Cummins then slammed home after Miller danced around the area to tee him up, before Craig cracked the bar amid the late flurry. With a tendency to finish the season strongly, and just a three-point gap to Rangers, the Perth side look capable of something special this term. Inverness CT manager Richie Foran: ""It is a tough time of the season to be sitting bottom, and I need real men to stand up to that, but not enough of them did that today. ""It is pure luck we are still in it and it is only four points. I sound like a broken record but one win changes it - that is the truth. But I need braver players with more passion and desire.",1,4,3

openai_curie,Leicestershire County Council has been helped by a small share of what's been called transitional funding - about £300m to help councils following pressure from Conservative MPs.,"Byron Rhodes is taking me around the modern council headquarters. It's full of light. It's busy. The building has regenerated the area around Melton Mowbray's railway station, once a muddy pot-holed piece of wasteland where those in the know parked for free. Now the council offices link the station to a park and the town centre. It was partly paid for with insurance money after a fire destroyed the old offices on the other side of town. A supermarket moved in to replace it and helped with the money too, putting the council on a firm financial footing. But that was four years ago and the crisis is a different one today. It's being experienced by all local authorities - cuts in central government funding which threaten the services they provide. Mr Rhodes is also deputy leader of Leicestershire County Council, with responsibility for finance. Leicestershire is historically the poorest funded council in the country because of a quirk of Whitehall recalculations, going back a quarter of a century since the poll tax, or community charge, was scrapped. At the moment councils get income from council tax, a share of the business rates, any income they generate themselves from services plus a grant from central government. It's the grant cut which is causing them grief. What's called the ""core funding"" is worked out by the number of homes multiplied by a set amount. And each authority has a different value set per dwelling. If we look at Surrey, which is top of the table, the amount will be £1,686 by 2019/20. Nottinghamshire is mid-table at £1,482, Derbyshire is in the lower reaches with £1,422 per dwelling and then comes Leicestershire at £1,354. ""The funding system is chaotic,"" says Byron Rhodes. ""It doesn't reflect real need. Look at Oxfordshire which is an interesting example,"" he says with a glint in his eye. Could he possibly be referring to the prime ministerial plea to the county council about cutbacks to services there? ""If we had the same funding as Oxfordshire, we'd have £50m a year extra. If we had the same as Surrey, we'd have £100m more. We'd be partying everyday if we had that kind of money."" Leicestershire have been helped with a small share of what's been called transitional funding - about £300m to help councils following pressure from Conservative MPs. Think back to the vote on Sunday trading. With a majority of only 17 in the Commons, the Conservatives lost the vote when 20 odd rebelled. Last month there would've been another rebellion, including some of our own Tory MPs in the East Midlands, if something wasn't done to improve the local government finance settlement over the next four years. The money has gone largely to shire counties. Leicestershire got £6.6m spread over two years, enough to save some services from closure. But it's a drop in the ocean for an authority with a £19m black hole in the budget every year after the latest cutbacks. Labour have protested that 83% of the councils getting transition funding are Conservative-run. Many Labour-run",1,4,3

openai_curie,"Manufacturing output has fallen for the fourth month in a row, putting more pressure on the UK economy.","The Markit/CIPS manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index fell to 49.2 from 50.7 in March. A reading below 50 indicates falling output. It is the first time that activity in the sector has fallen since March 2013. Firms blamed soft domestic demand, a fall in new business from overseas and uncertainty ahead of the EU referendum. A slowdown in the oil and gas industry, a major customer for UK companies, is also hitting production. The index for new orders fell to 50.4 in April, from 51.9 the month before, matching February's three-year low. Rob Dobson, senior economist at Markit, said: ""On this evidence manufacturing production is now falling at a quarterly pace of around 1%, and will likely act as a drag on the economy again during the second quarter and putting greater pressure on the service sector to sustain GDP growth. ""The manufacturing labour market is also being impacted, with the data signalling close to 20,000 job losses over the past three months."" Last week, official figures showed UK economic growth slowed to 0.4% in the first quarter of the year from 0.6% in late 2015, propped up by the services sector. David Noble, group chief executive at the Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply (CIPS), said: ""Recent fears over a stall in the UK's manufacturing sector have now become a reality. ""An atmosphere of deep unease is building throughout the manufacturing supply chain, eating away at new orders, reducing British exports and putting more jobs at risk. ""A sense of apprehension across the sector is being caused by enduring volatility in the oil and gas industry, falling retailer confidence and the uncertainty created by the EU referendum."" The Markit/CIPS survey found new export orders contracted for the fourth straight month in April as the global economy continued to slow. A measure of employment in the manufacturing sector was also below the 50 mark for its fourth straight month. Lee Hopley, chief economist at the manufacturers' organisation, EEF, said: ""The sharp drop to a three-year low and another month of reported job cuts could be the clearest sign yet that referendum uncertainty is starting to weigh on the real economy. ""However, this is just another straw on the back of a sector already grappling with the struggling oil and gas sector, softening domestic demand and weak order outlook from other parts of the world, all of which are failing to provide any counterbalance to the political uncertainty at home.""",1,5,4

It was the first time the 32-year-old Spaniard had driven the car for the Oxfordshire-based Marussia team. Inspectors from the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) visited the test track on Wednesday. Marussia said surgeons at Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge ""embarked on a lengthy procedure to address the serious head and facial injuries sustained by Maria in the accident"". It said: ""The operation began yesterday afternoon and she was in theatre until this morning. ""Maria remains in a critical but stable condition."" John Booth, team principal of the Marussia F1 Team, said: ""Maria emerged from theatre at Addenbrooke's Hospital this morning after a lengthy operation to address the serious head and facial injuries she received in the accident at Duxford Airfield yesterday. ""We are grateful for the medical attention that Maria has been receiving and her family would like to thank the Neurological and Plastics surgical teams. ""However, it is with great sadness that I must report that, due to the injuries she sustained, Maria has lost her right eye. ""Maria's care and the wellbeing of her family remain our priority at this time. Her family are at the hospital and we are doing everything possible to support them."" De Villota sustained her injuries after her car ""suddenly accelerated"" into the back of the support lorry, according to witnesses. BBC Radio Cambridgeshire presenter Chris Mann, who saw the accident, said: ""The top of her car and her helmet seemed to take the brunt of it. ""She didn't move for about 15 minutes."" He said De Villota had been driving at up to 200mph during the testing, but the car was travelling considerably slower at the time of the crash. Mr Booth said: ""With regard to the accident, we have embarked on a very comprehensive analysis of what happened and this work continues for the moment."" Messages of support have come in from the motor racing world, including ones from Ferrari driver and fellow Spaniard Fernando Alonso and Jenson Button. Formula 1 driver and BBC analyst Jaime Alguersari said in his weekly column : ""I was shocked to hear of the accident suffered by Maria de Villota. I know her and her family very well. I still don't know the cause of the accident. There are so many rumours but I want to wait to see what really happened. ""It's terribly sad. Maria is a fantastic person, as are her brothers and her father Emilio, who was one of Spain's first F1 drivers. ""She is a role model, especially for all the females who want to get into F1.

openai_curie,"Mead is becoming more popular in the US, but it still has a bad reputation.","But what's brewing in this new crop of commercial meaderies - as they are known - is lot more refined from the drink that once decorated tables across medieval Europe. ""Do we have any mead makers or home brewers in the group?"" asks Ben Alexander, eying a crowd of a dozen or so people who have come to his Maine Meade Works, in Portland, on a rainy Friday for a tour. When no-one raises their hand, Mr Alexander launches into the full spiel. ""If you guys want to come around, I'll show you how this thing works,"" he says, gesturing to two ceiling-high columns of stainless steel filled with something resembling a mushy golden porridge. ""We mix up honey and water over there and we pump it through a hot water bath at 160 degrees [71C] in a stainless steel coil here. Each one produces about 50 to 75 gallons [227-340 litres] of mead a day,"" explains Mr Alexander. It's fair to say he is obsessed with mead. ""It's the quintessential local beverage - you can go anywhere in the world and find honey to make mead, and I think that's unique among alcoholic beverages,"" he gushes. After being introduced to the drink by a home brewer, Mr Alexander thought there were profits to be had in a commercial meadery. He founded Maine Mead Works in 2008, pouring his savings and money from friends and family into the business. His business has since grown, along with the popularity of mead in the US. It's now a seven-person operation that manufactures more than 7,500 cases a year, shipping them as far away as China. Mr Alexander is not the only one to have caught on to the commercial potential of mead. Vicky Rowe, the owner of mead information website GotMead, says interest in the product in the US has exploded in the past decade. ""We went from 30-40 meaderies making mead to somewhere in the vicinity of 250 in the last 10 years,"" she says. ""I like to say that everything old is new again - people come back to what was good once."" Even visitors to Mr Alexander's meadery agree. Tour participant Dirk Heseman admitted that while Maine Mead Works was the first meadery he'd actually visited, he has noticed that mead ""is becoming more and more available - similar to cider"". Just this year, commercial meaderies in the US have banded together to form an industry group, the American Mead Makers Association, to better share information and encourage growth in the industry. But there's a lot of work that needs to be done to improve the image of a drink long associated with Renaissance fairs and medieval re-enactments. ""I think our number one challenge as an industry is awareness of what mead is,"" says Mr Alexander. ""You ask 10 people in a room if they've ever heard of mead, and two of them might say, 'yes', and only one of them has had a very positive experience."" The mead of the past was often sweet, and didn't appeal to many drinkers",1,3,3

openai_curie,Morocco has been readmitted to the African Union after a long absence.,"It was a ""good opportunity"" and ""a chance to work together,"" a top Western Sahara official told the BBC. Morocco controls two-thirds of Western Sahara and sees it as part of its historic territory. However some, including the UN, see Western Sahara as Africa's last colony. Africa Live: More on this and other stories Find out more about Western Sahara A referendum was promised in 1991 but never carried out due to wrangling over who was eligible to vote. Thousands of Sahrawi refugees still live in refugee camps in Algeria - some have been there for 40 years. It is not clear what happens next but Western Sahara is hopeful that a committee set up by the AU will address the issues that both sides have raised. Some AU delegates said that it would be easier to resolve the issue with Morocco inside the AU. Sidi Mohammed, a Western Sahara official, told the BBC that Morocco's return to the AU means that it would now be expected to put ""in practice decisions taken by the AU with regard to a referendum in Western Sahara"". Mr Mohammed dismissed the suggestion that Morocco would now seek to get the AU to change its position, saying that the no country could unilaterally change the AU fundamental agreement, saying it opposed colonisation. In his speech at the AU summit, King Mohammed VI of Morocco said the readmission was not meant to divide the continental body. No. Algeria has always been a big supporter of Western Sahara's Polisario Front and it had wanted Morocco to accept independence of the territory as a condition for readmission. Zimbabwe and South Africa were also supportive of this stance but they were outnumbered by those who wanted Morocco back in the fold. There is no specific provision in the AU charter that bars any country from joining it. Morocco simply applied and the request was accepted by more than two-thirds of the 53 members. Morocco has been involved in intense lobbying and applied in July last year to rejoin the continental body. King Mohammed toured various African countries seeking support for the bid. No. While culturally the country's identity aligns with Arab states, its economic interests increasingly lie in Africa. This is a strategic move to continue exploring its interests in mining, construction, medical, insurance and banking sectors on the continent.

The article also said he had warned the PM the UK would have to pay its ""fair share"" and spend 2% of GDP on defence. In response, Number 10 said there were ""many difficult challenges"" in Libya, while the White House said it deeply valued the UK's contributions. Downing Street did not comment on President Obama's remark to the PM about defence spending, reportedly made before Chancellor George Osborne said the government would fulfil a Nato pledge to spend 2% of national income on defence last year. In response to the interview, a spokesman for the US National Security Council said Mr Cameron had been ""as close a partner as the president has had"" adding that ""we deeply value the UK's contributions on our shared national security and foreign policy objectives"". BBC North America editor Jon Sopel said the unsolicited statement put out by the White House suggested Downing Street had reacted angrily to the article. ""It's like we've seen a curtain drawn back on the unspun thoughts of President Obama, complete with frustration as well, and what we've seen tonight is the White House trying to close the curtain as quickly as it can,"" he added. The toppling of the Gaddafi regime in Libya - following UN-backed air strikes designed to protect civilians - led to a power vacuum and instability, with no authority in full control. The intervention was led by the UK and France - and in his interview, Mr Obama reflects on ""what went wrong"", saying: ""There's room for criticism, because I had more faith in the Europeans, given Libya's proximity, being invested in the follow-up."" Mr Cameron, he said, became ""distracted by a range of other things"". He also criticised former French President Nicolas Sarkozy, saying he had tried to claim the spotlight. The former French president, he said, ""wanted to trumpet the flights he was taking in the air campaign, despite the fact that we had wiped out all the air defences and essentially set up the entire infrastructure"" for the intervention. President Obama said the intervention ""averted large-scale civilian casualties (and) prevented what almost surely would have been a prolonged and bloody civil conflict"". But he added: ""And despite all that, Libya is a mess."" He also criticised what he called ""free riders"" in the interview, saying European and Gulf countries were calling for action against Gaddafi, adding: ""But what has been a habit over the last several decades in these circumstances is people pushing us to act but then showing an unwillingness to put any skin in the game.""

openai_curie,Ricky Burns is the first Scot to win world titles at three different weights.,"With three defeats in his previous six bouts, the Scottish boxer's career seemed to be on the wane. But his power, timing and focus returned in a supremely confident display at Glasgow's Hydro on Saturday night as he clinched the vacant WBA World Super-Lightweight title - and entered the record books as the first Scot to win world titles at three weights. Italy's Michele Di Rocco, at 34 a year older than Burns, hadn't lost a fight since September 2007. He arrived with a record of 40 wins and a draw from 42 bouts. He left a lesser figure. The referee deemed the man from Assisi to be in no state to continue in the eighth round, the result of a welter of blows to his head and body and made all the more unbearable by the hostile acoustic energy generated by 8,000 Scottish fans. Surely, for Burns, this was time to shout about his record, the ideal moment to counter all those who had written him off and questioned the wisdom of him leaving trainer Billy Nelson two years ago to work with Tony Sim in Essex? No. Instead, the champion spoke of his disbelief at the ease of his victory, his gratitude that he was safe, of his thanks to promoter Eddie Hearn, manager Alex Morrison and coach Sim for believing in him, and of his desire to celebrate with a fast-food burger and 20 chicken nuggets. ""When I got in the ring after the fight, I said, 'You've done it! You've done it!',"" reported a beaming Hearn at the post-fight media conference. ""And you know what Ricky said? 'Can you get a picture with me and Michael Buffer [the legendary American boxing ring announcer]?'"" When he has time to reflect during a well-earned holiday, Burns will take immense satisfaction at being only the third British-born fighter, after Bob Fitzsimmons and Duke McKenzie, to be a three-weight world champion. In Scottish terms, his achievements must mean that he is in the very top tier of boxing greats, comfortably mentioned in the same breath as former world champions Benny Lynch, Walter McGowan, Jackie Paterson, Ken Buchanan and Jim Watt, for example. Burns' record stands at 40 wins from 46 bouts. Remarkably, 11 of those have been world title fights. Buchanan's exploits in the United States add lustre to his legacy, but while Burns may never have fought someone like Roberto Duran, should Hearn manage to set up a bout against Cincinnati's Adrien Broner, the four-time world champion stripped of the WBA title because he could not make the weight, then Burns could achieve little more in the sport. ""There are some big fights out there for me,"" said Burns. ""I want to fight the top names. I will fight anybody. I do super-lightweight comfortably and lightweight is still an option. I would fight Terence Crawford again if it came down to it. ""That's nearly two years I have been with Tony and things have just started clicking.

The draw sees third-placed Hampshire claim 12 points, while Surrey take 10 points and stay sixth in Division One. Burns' epic effort saw him stay in the field for all but 10 overs of the entire match, as he defied Hampshire's bowling efforts on a flat Oval pitch. The left-hander was dropped twice in the slip cordon in his career-best 219, but was the only one to resist as Ian Holland (3-37) dismissed Tom Curran (53), Amar Virdi and Mark Footitt to force the follow-on after Surrey began the day on 410-7. Mark Stoneman (47) and Burns then put on an opening stand of 109 before Holland's medium pace had Stoneman lbw and Scott Borthwick bowled in a single over. Sean Ervine became the only man to dismiss Burns in 756 minutes of play when he missed a ball down the leg side, but Jason Roy and Dominic Sibley continued on until the conclusion. Surrey captain Rory Burns told BBC Radio London: ""I'm really pleased that we've fought that hard to get the draw and the extra five points, and obviously pretty happy with how I've played. ""We had to bat seven sessions to get us to safety and that's all I was thinking. ""There were some jitters in the nineties and I got a lifeline, which was quite nice.

Some already share advice on how to use proxy servers in order to access social media sites that, in their view, are under threat of being closed. It is hard to see how the law will be enforced. The servers for most of the popular social media platforms that many Russians use are based outside Russia. Many popular bloggers are already looking for, and apparently finding, ways to ""cheat"" the feature that counts page visits and keep their daily unique visitor numbers just under 3000, or to make sure that the statistics are hidden altogether. Anton Nossik, who is considered Russia's ""internet guru"", wrote in his LiveJournal blog that the new law didn't threaten individual bloggers directly, but provided legal grounds to block popular social networks like Facebook, Twitter, LiveJournal and Google. ""The issue of banning all these platforms in Russia is a political one and it will be decided by only one person"", Mr Nossik wrote, with a thinly veiled reference to President Vladimir Putin. Earlier in the year, Russia enacted a law that gave the government powers to block websites without explanation. In March, Moscow blocked the blog of Mr Navalny, along with two news sites and a organisation run by Garry Kasparov - a vocal critic of the Russian government. In a statement, Russia's prosecutor general's office said the blocks were imposed because of the sites' role in helping stage illegal protests. Earlier this week, Twitter blocked access to an anti-Kremlin account that often publishes leaked government documents, following a request by Russia's federal communications agency Roskomnadzor. For many years, Russia had relatively lax internet laws. However Moscow has recently changed its tune, with Mr Putin branding the internet an ongoing ""CIA project"". He also claimed that",1,4,4
openai_curie,Scotland's sporting budget is being cut by 20% in three years.,"sportscotland says it has yet to decide where the cuts will fall amid concerns that elite athletes could suffer. The cuts are being blamed on reduced government spending and a drop in National Lottery ticket sales - a major contributor to sports backing. Governing bodies are bracing themselves for potential job losses. About 60% of funding is made up from Scottish Government money, with lottery sales making up the rest. In the year ending 2015, total revenue was £65.1m, which is divided up and awarded to 52 sports. By the end of next year, that figure will have fallen to £51.8m - a cut to the Scottish sporting budget of 20% in just three years. sportscotland chairman Mel Young said: ""It's heartbreaking to me because I know the effort the sport governing bodies and the community that's around it; the volunteers and the mums and dads. ""And, to have to say that we're having to cut some money back is, I believe, not the right way to go."" Former badminton player Susan Egelstaff, a double bronze medallist at the Commonwealth Games [in 2002 and 2006] and an Olympian, fears the cuts will have ""a huge impact"". ""What that means in the future is that Scotland will be constantly playing catch-up,"" she said. ""It's almost impossible to catch up if you fall too far behind the leading nations."" The Scottish Government said sport and physical activity play a ""key role"" in a healthy Scotland and that ""significant"" investment would continue in those areas. ""Having successfully delivered the Commonwealth Games [in 2014] we are now focusing on protecting or raising investment in areas intended to decrease health inequality and improve life chances, and the small reduction in the sport budget allows us to support those priorities,"" Minister for Sport Aileen Campbell said. ""There is on-going support for active lifestyles through capital investment in cycling and walking, and over the last 10 years we have invested £168m in sport infrastructure - from grassroots to the elite performance which has increased the facilities and opportunities to get people active and achieve on the world stage at both the Olympics and Commonwealth Games.""",1,4,3

Ms Teal was previously arrested for protesting against the tree removals. Charges against her and 13 others were dropped earlier this year. More stories from across Yorkshire Sheffield City Council maintain that the removal of street trees in the city is lawful and necessary. A ""pre-action protocol letter"" from the council's legal department to Ms Teal warned the authority will seek a High Court injunction to stop her, and others involved in ""direct action"", from taking part in future protests. The council said the process would give protesters ""a chance to further and finally consider their position"" before it begins legal proceedings on 12 July. Councillor Bryan Lodge, cabinet member for Environment and Street Scene, said there had been months of ""unlawful and costly disruption"" to tree replacement works in Sheffield by a small number of protesters. ""We continue to support the right to peacefully protest, and the majority of protesters who are doing so peacefully will not be affected,"" he added. ""But there is a big difference between this and direct action which deliberately and unlawfully stops works from being carried out."" Mr Lodge said protesters had been sent a letter several weeks ago confirming their actions were unlawful. ""Streets Ahead is not just about street trees, it's about ensuring we have roads, pavements and a street scene to be proud of for many years to come,"" he added. ""In addition, it presents us with a unique opportunity to sustainably manage, increase and maintain our diverse street tree stock over a 25 year period."" The council said, despite the letter, works were still being disrupted ""causing city-wide delays"".",1,3,3

openai_curie,"The Conservatives have been given a huge confidence boost and will feel in a position to challenge in more constituencies next year, rather than just on the list.","The Conservatives have been given a huge confidence boost and will feel in a position to challenge in more constituencies next year, rather than just on the list. At the party's weekly press briefing, I asked the Welsh Conservative leader Andrew RT Davies, who was elected on the list, whether he'd stand as a constituency candidate in his home turf of the Vale of Glamorgan but he said he hadn't thought about it. Presumably those are the kind of decisions they will now feel more confident contemplating. The party will also have a huge amount of new data on voters which it'll be able to call upon and the belief that campaigning hard on the NHS helped the Tories cross the line in places like the Vale of Clwyd and Gower. The Conservatives feel it's them, rather than any of the other opposition parties, who have become the repository of votes from those who are disaffected by the state of the NHS. Welsh Labour are going to hold a ""short sharp"" analysis into what went wrong. Carwyn Jones was in line with most of the criticism of Ed Miliband when he told AMs that the party needed to appeal to small business owners who are not millionaires but who work hard. What will be more difficult is countering the argument on the NHS, which the former minister Alun Davies believes is already lost. Another potential difficulty for Welsh Labour will be dealing with unhappiness within the party over council re-organisation. Bernie Attridge, the deputy leader of Flintshire Council, has tweeted saying the party needs to be careful on local government reform if it wants to retain the support of grassroots councillors. It also seems to have been the case that Labour lost more votes to UKIP than the Conservatives, which is another challenge to overcome. But Labour will at least have the advantage that it will be David Cameron, and not Ed Miliband, carrying out the latest round of public sector cuts that are likely to take effect sooner rather than later. The question is whether Carwyn Jones is going to be able to turn that to his advantage when his own record in government will be under scrutiny. Plaid Cymru's education spokesman, Simon Thomas, also in the party's weekly press briefing, said he believed Leanne Wood could portray herself as an alternative first minister because of the way she emotionally connected with people in the campaign. The party now has a year to make that a credible proposition after it failed to gain any new seats and came fourth, behind UKIP, in the overall share of the vote, despite her unprecedented profile. He also said that on the campaign trail people wanted to know what Plaid was going to do about the NHS and that people ""did not see the strengths"" of its arguments. The Welsh Liberal Democrats are still licking their wounds but in a ""je ne regrette rien"" moment, the leader Kirsty Williams said she had no regrets over the coalition. She has admitted the party failed to communicate",1,4,3

However, the council is now paying Â£450 to fill it up again, so that the town looks its best for key 2012 events. It will be working on the 4 and 5 June and when the Olympic torch relay passes through the borough on 8 July. The fountain on Parkway in the town was built to celebrate the Queen's accession to the throne in 1952. It is supplied by an underground tank, but had to be switched off after the water level dropped and could not be refilled. The council is buying water from a landscaping firm which already supplies water from a natural lake source, to maintain the borough's open spaces. It cannot be drunk so is permitted under the hosepipe ban regulations. Council chief executive, Michel Saminaden, said: ""They have told us that there is an abundance of water in this lake so we are probably doing them a favour by taking it."" Mr Saminaden added that the council decided against asking the Veolia water company for a special dispensation. ""I thought that wasn't the right thing to do because we would be using precious water,"" he said. ""What we are doing now is using water that is surplus and we have been told categorically that there is no problem in using it. This is a better all round sustainable solution. ""I am extremely pleased that we have been able to find a solution which will enable everybody to see the fountain in all its glory on the occasion of these two great celebrations.""",1,4,4

The Vatican usually responds within six weeks to approve such a new ambassador. The nomination of Mr Stefanini was seen as a litmus test for Pope Francis, who has taken a more liberal stance on homosexuality. A French government spokesman said there had been negotiations with the Vatican over the appointment. ""France has chosen its ambassador to the Vatican. This choice was Stefanini and that remains the French proposal,"" said spokesman Stephane Le Foll. Observers say most Vatican appointments are confirmed within six weeks and that this long silence should be read as a rejection. The Vatican traditionally makes no statement if it intends to decline a nomination. Mr Stefanini served in the Holy See as a deputy ambassador in the French embassy from 2001 to 2005. He was described by the country's foreign ministry as ""one of our best diplomats"". France legalised same-sex marriage in 2013, despite opposition from the Catholic Church.

The couple spoke out in response to consultation on proposed reform of sentencing for driving offences. They believe increased sentences should be backed up by manslaughter charges. Mr Moores, 28, was killed by a Vauxhall Astra driven by Donna Hackett on the M4 near Swindon. Hackett, then aged 26, fled and was found by police asleep in a ditch. She served half of a six-year jail term after she was found guilty of causing death by careless driving while drunk. The Ministry of Justice consultation suggests offenders who cause death by careless driving while under the influence of drink or drugs could soon be handed a life sentence - an increase on the current 14-year upper limit. Source: Crown Prosecution Service But Mr and Mrs Moores, from Chandlers Ford, Hampshire, also want the offence to be upgraded to a charge of manslaughter. Mr Moores said: ""Somebody can drive drunk and kill my son. Why is that not manslaughter? ""Nothing can prepare a parent for seeing their child in the mortuary. That will stay with me every day, every day that vision comes into my mind. ""Our life is ruined."" Mrs Moores added: ""There's nothing careless about drink driving. I don't want anybody else to feel like us."" Ms Hackett, who lived in Radnor Street, Swindon, at the time of the offence, appealed against her sentence in September 2011, but was refused. A Ministry of Justice spokesperson said: ""We are determined to make sure those who kill whilst driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs face the full force of the law. ""That is why we are consulting on plans that will see the maximum sentence for a number of offences in this area increase from 14 years to life.""

openai_curie,The Scottish government has been told it must change the Named Person legislation to ensure it does not breach the rights of children and their families.,"John Swinney will address MSPs over a legal challenge to information sharing proposals within the Act. The system would appoint a named person - usually a teacher or health visitor - to ensure the wellbeing of every child. But judges at the UK's highest court ruled against the scheme in July 2016, citing concerns over information sharing. The Supreme Court judges said some proposals breached rights to privacy and a family life under the European Convention on Human Rights. However, the court said the aim of the Act, which is intended to promote and safeguard the rights and wellbeing of children and young people, was legitimate. Speaking ahead of his statement to the Scottish Parliament, Mr Swinney said the Scottish government remained ""absolutely committed"" to the Named Person service as a way to support children and their families. ""Last year the Supreme Court ruled definitively that the intention of providing a Named Person for every child to promote and safeguard their wellbeing was 'unquestionably legitimate and benign',"" he said. ""Their judgement did, however, require us to change the provisions relating to information sharing. ""Since the judgement, we have undertaken an intensive period of engagement with children, young people, parents, carers, practitioners and professionals. ""I will now update parliament on the next steps in this vital means of supporting, safeguarding and promoting the wellbeing of our children and young people."" The judges said in July that specific proposals about information-sharing were ""not within the legislative competence of the Scottish Parliament"". And they said the legislation made it ""perfectly possible"" that confidential information about a young person could be disclosed to a ""wide range of public authorities without either the child or young person or her parents being aware"". The appeal was brought by the No to Named Persons (NO2NP) coalition, which includes the Christian Institute, Care (Christian Action Research and Education), Tyme Trust and the Family Education Trust.

openai_curie,The Supreme Court has ruled that the government cannot deny subsidies to people who buy health insurance under the Affordable Care Act.,"In a 6-3 decision, the justices said that tax subsidies that make health insurance affordable for low-income individuals can continue. The ruling preserves the law known as Obamacare, which Mr Obama considers a major part of his presidential legacy. Republicans have vowed to continue fighting the law. ""We've got more work to do, but what we're not going to do is unravel what has now been woven into the fabric of America,"" Mr Obama said. The case, known as King v Burwell, was the second major challenge the law has faced in the US's highest court. Unlike in many other western countries, the US does not have a single-payer healthcare system. Private companies, rather than the US government, provide health insurance for US citizens. The enactment of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) - one of Mr Obama's most significant and controversial domestic achievements - in 2010 mandated that every American had to purchase private insurance. It provided the subsidies to allow many to do so. In 2012, the mandate portion of the law was challenged in the court. The justices ruled to preserve it. In that decision, as in the decision on Thursday, Chief Justice John Roberts surprised observers by siding with his liberal colleagues in support of the law. ""Congress passed the Affordable Care act to improve health insurance markets, not to destroy them,"" Chief Justice John Roberts wrote in the opinion. Justice Anthony Kennedy dissented in 2012, but sided with the majority on Thursday. Had the court made the opposite decision, an estimated 8.7 million people in the US would have been at risk of losing the aid that makes healthcare affordable. The stakes could not have been higher. People's health (crucially important) and Obama's legacy (less important, but for him and those around him fairly vital) were at stake. Well a politically finely balanced Supreme Court has given an emphatic, overwhelming vote in favour of the president by 6-3. I bet ""No-drama Obama"" is high-fiving anyone and everyone in the White House - that is how big it is. Obama defies lame-duck expectations Demonstrators gathered outside the court as early on Thursday morning. Reading updates on their mobile phones, the crowd became jubilant when they learned mid-morning that the court had ruled in their favour. Some began dancing, while others chanted ""If you're covered and you know it clap your hands."" ""This is a big sigh of relief for millions across the country,"" said Ron Pollack of Families USA, a health-care advocacy organisation. ""The ACA is not just the law of the land, it will remain the law of the land"". ""Today is a good day for healthcare in America,"" said activist Benton Strong. ""I hope this is the end of the line."" Demonstrators opposing the subsidies did not have a large visible presence. Justice Antonin Scalia wrote in his dissent that the Supreme Court is setting a precedent of favouring some laws over others. ""We should start calling this law Scotuscare"" Justice Scalia wrote, referring to the court's acronym. ""Today's interpretation is not merely unnatural; it is unheard",1,5,4
openai_curie,The Welsh government has decided to scrap plans to create marine protected areas in Welsh seas.,"Alun Davies told AMs they had received 7,000 responses to a consultation containing ""strongly held"" views. He said he would now look at the 125 existing marine protected areas to see if further improvements could be made. The Marine Conservation Society (MCS) described it as an ""embarrassing U-turn"" for the Welsh government, and has called for better protection of seas. Creating the zones would mean a ban on fishing and anchoring in some areas and had brought opposition. The Welsh Fishermen's Association said previously that existing conservation networks for Welsh waters are adequate. The Welsh government proposed the zones last year with the backing of the Countryside Council of Wales and the Marine Conservation Society. The minister for natural resources said the decision had been made after the thousands of responses to the consultation brought ""divergent and strongly held views"". Mr Davies said to ""avoid any continuing uncertainty over the options presented in the 2012 consultation, I am also withdrawing all the proposed sites"". His comments come after the findings were published of a task and finish team which reviewed the feedback. Now, he will concentrate on the existing 125 Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) that cover 36% of Welsh seas to see if any changes can be made rather than creating additional zones. ""We are now in a stronger position to assess our current contribution to the network's ecological coherence,"" he said. ""I have, therefore, commissioned an assessment of our current MPAs to identify if there are any gaps and what the options might be to fill those gaps. ""If any measures are required, I believe they should be simple, proportionate and fit for purpose."" Dr Peter Richardson, biodiversity programme manager for MCS, said the Welsh government ""spent an awful lot of time and money and encouraged other people to put effort into this consultation response"". He said: ""70% of the consultation responses were in favour of designating these sites and yet today the minister has announced he's scrapping the whole thing... bit of an embarrassing U-turn for the government I think.""

With provisional results in from more than 40% of polling stations earlier on Wednesday, Mr Odinga had 42% of the vote compared with Mr Kenyatta's 53%. However, Mr Odinga's allies remain confident that he will gain ground as results from his strongholds, including the Coast Province, are declared. More than 1,000 people were killed in the violence which broke out in 2007-08 after Mr Odinga claimed he had been cheated of victory by supporters of President Mwai Kibaki, who is stepping down after two terms in office. The BBC's Solomon Mugera in the capital, Nairobi, says Kenyans are becoming increasingly anxious about the delay in finalising the results. Some businesses and schools across the country have remained shut since Monday's election, he says.

The Foreign Office has said it is in contact with the Turkish authorities. The BBC's Mark Lowen said the information about the ages of the children had not been independently verified and it was too early to know where the group were intending to head to. ""Were they heading for one of the more moderate groups in Syria. Were they heading for the area controlled by al-Nusra, the al-Qaeda affiliate? Or were they heading to so-called Islamic State territory?"" he said.

They have undergone medical examinations and had their finger-prints taken. The United Nations estimates the number of foreign fighters joining militant groups is more than 25,000, from 100 different nations. About 600 Britons are believed to have gone to Syria or Iraq since IS seized control of large swathes of territory there.

In the latest report, inspectors said the curriculum at Phoenix Academy was ""inadequate"", while ""weak teaching"" meant pupils were not sufficiently challenged and were often ""disengaged and disruptive"". There was particular criticism of standards in English and maths which the watchdog said were limiting pupils' achievements in other areas. Ofsted's report said governors, managers and teachers had developed a ""culture of low expectations"", while leaders had failed to act decisively to halt the decline in pupils' achievement. There was, however, some praise for the acting head teacher. Inspectors said he had introduced a number of improvement measures and some were ""beginning to have an impact"". A report on Lakeside School highlighted similar concerns, criticising teachers for not sufficiently challenging pupils and for having ""over generous"" predictions of their achievement. Inspectors said many pupils, whether high achievers or those with special educational needs, were ""not making the progress they should"" and achievements at GCSE were well below the national average. Governors were also criticised for not holding leaders to account, while the report said management had failed to effectively monitor either pupils or teachers. Inspectors, did however highlight new initiatives to improve literacy which they said were ""beginning to have a positive impact"".",1,4,3

The above article is a summary of the full article. If you are the author of this article, please consider updating it to add a more detailed summary.","Steven Maclean bundled home the opener five minutes before half-time. The hosts, slacker after the break, had beleaguered striker Larnell Cole sent-off after he confronted the referee. Liam Craig sealed the win from the penalty spot with two minutes to play, before Graham Cummins finished a sumptuous stoppage-time move. And things got worse still for Caley Thistle after the match, with captain Gary Warren shown a red card in the tunnel. Saints remain five points clear of Hearts in fourth place, and closed the gap on third-placed Rangers, who play Aberdeen on Sunday, to three points. With game after game ticking past, Inverness' position looks increasingly perilous. Next weekend's trip to Motherwell, second-bottom on goal difference, is now seismic. This contest turned nightmarish for the hosts after a bright opening, but the truth is, given their predicament, Caley Thistle did not threaten St Johnstone's goal enough. Billy Mckay sent a shot over from close range. Alex Fisher nodded a diving header wide. Carl Tremarco miscued a volley. Greg Tansey did draw a save from Alan Mannus when he rasped in an effort from outside the box, but Richie Foran's side never looked likely to find the net. Their best opportunity came immediately after the Saints went ahead, when Tansey fed Cole, who seemed to panic in a terrific position and shot straight at Mannus. Cole's dismissal ended the contest when he appeared to be cautioned twice for challenging referee Stephen Finnie's decision not to award a foul. St Johnstone were merciless and could have had more. With just one win from their last 21 league games, Inverness look deep in trouble. Tommy Wright's side deserve so much credit. Saints were tactically brilliant, so strong defensively and ruthlessly capitalised on their man advantage. They took one of their few first-half chances when Michael Coulson broke down the left and sent a dangerous ball across the six-yard box. Owain Fon Williams could only parry into the danger area, Cummins' shot was blocked but Maclean followed up to force it home. They should have had another when Craig's superb curling corner flew all the way to the back post where Cummins slid in and somehow knocked it over from two yards. Craig, in his 300th appearance for the club, coolly converted a spot-kick after Cummins was tripped to seal the points. Cummins then slammed home after Miller danced around the area to tee him up, before Craig cracked the bar amid the late flurry. With a tendency to finish the season strongly, and just a three-point gap to Rangers, the Perth side look capable of something special this term. Inverness CT manager Richie Foran: ""It is a tough time of the season to be sitting bottom, and I need real men to stand up to that, but not enough of them did that today. ""It is pure luck we are still in it and it is only four points. I sound like a broken record but one win changes it - that is the truth. But I need braver players with more passion and desire.",0,2,1

He is the former editor of The Spect","Mr Johnson, the Mayor of London, announced on Sunday that he would be backing the campaign for Britain to leave the EU. His intervention in the debate - made, as he termed it, with ""deafening eclat"" - was even said to have helped cause the pound to slide on the international money markets as traders thought it made the possibility of a so-called Brexit more likely. He has arguably the highest profile of any of the governing Conservative Party except the Prime Minister David Cameron, but those outside the UK may be wondering: who is he, and is that actually his hair? Read on. Profile: Boris Johnson How could 'zip wire prat' become prime minister? Read more about the UK's referendum on the EU Alexander Boris de Pfeffel Johnson, to give him his full name, was born in New York and is descended from Turkish, French and German stock. He describes himself as a ""one-man melting pot"". He first made a name for himself in journalism, including a stint as Brussels correspondent for the right-wing Daily Telegraph newspaper and editor of The Spectator magazine. His humorous persona led him to become a fixture on various television programmes, including the satirical BBC panel show Have I Got News For You. He still has a lucrative and entertaining column in the Daily Telegraph, in which august forum he explained the reasons for his decision on the EU. As a politician, he has been a Conservative member of parliament for two constituencies, Henley from 2001 to 2008 and then Uxbridge and South Ruislip from 2015. Lest you think he was putting his feet up between parliamentary mandates, he is also currently serving the second of two terms as mayor of London, no mean feat in a city where the centre-left Labour Party has dominated in recent decades. That's indicative of the position Mr Johnson has carved out for himself as one of the most charismatic politicians in the UK who has wide appeal beyond Conservative heartlands - polling has suggested that his stance on the EU referendum may sway some undecided voters. Just look what happens when you type his name into Google.co.uk. Not quite. He has previously courted controversy for his remarks about (among others) the populations of Liverpool, Portsmouth and Papua New Guinea, not to mention run-ins with his own party leadership and TV chef Jamie Oliver. Last October he accidentally flattened a 10-year-old schoolboy at what was meant to be a friendly game of photo-op rugby in Japan. But none of this seems to have affected his standing among the party faithful or the public at large. Even getting stuck on a zip-wire during the London Olympics in 2012, a sure-fire route to derision for any other politician, only enhanced his eccentric image. Mr Johnson finally ended months of speculation about which side of the EU debate he would back in an immaculately impromptu media scrum outside his home in North London, having reportedly informed the prime minister of his decision earlier the same day.

That is down from 6.1% in the previous quarter. Analysts were expecting the same figure for January to March. India is the third-largest economy in Asia but has been struggling with inflation and currency weakness. Since July last year, the Indian rupee has seen one of the biggest declines among Asian currencies, dropping more than 27% against the US dollar. ""Shocking numbers as growth was even lower than lows witnessed during the financial crisis,"" said Anubhuti Sahay from Standard Chartered Bank in Mumbai. The BBC's Yogita Limaye in Mumbai said that just a year ago India was aspiring for double-digit growth. But a global slowdown has reduced external demand, and high inflation coupled with a weak rupee has made things more expensive within the country. Domestic demand, which India's economy is largely reliant on, has also slowed in part due to the political upheaval in the country.

openai_curie (0 shot),Lennon's appointment as manager of Hibernian is a good move for both parties. He has a good track record in the Scottish Premier League and will be able to build on the foundations of the team that won the Scottish Cup last season.,"His previous jobs were at Celtic and Bolton, but moving to the second tier of Scottish football was no hindrance to him returning to work at Easter Road. Lennon saw the vacancy as an opportunity, and that was enough to encourage Hibs that a figure of his profile and experience would accept a role in the Championship. Even though his last job in Scotland involved leading a team on Champions League duty, Lennon's mind has not been swayed by haughtiness. The appointment of the former Celtic manager as successor to Alan Stubbs suits both parties, because it is mutually beneficial. Success is alluring, and Hibs offer Lennon the chance to accumulate more achievements. He was immediately engaged in crisis management at his previous club Bolton, but will find stability, potential and accomplishment at Easter Road. The demand will be to deliver promotion, but that will not seem daunting when the majority of the squad that pushed Rangers for a while last season then won the Scottish Cup is still in place. Lennon's task is to refine and bolster the team, when new managers are often faced with a period of overhaul. Stubbs left the club on an emotional high after delivering their first Scottish Cup in 114 years, but before the final against Rangers there was a tangible sense of exasperation that promotion had been missed. Hibs were entitled to feel that it was an unnecessary failure given their circumstances. The club is about to embark on a third season in the Championship, but by most other measures they can be considered a top-flight outfit. The budget will be significantly more than the rest of the teams in the division, the training ground at East Mains and facilities are first-class, the football side of the business is stable and well-run by George Craig, the club's head of football operations, the squad is full of talent. Lennon can rely on consistently assured performances from the likes of David Gray, Darren McGregor, Paul Hanlon, Lewis Stevenson, John McGinn, Fraser Fyvie, Dylan McGeouch, James Keatings and Jason Cummings. Some minor issues remain, such as who will fill the goal next season, but the challenge is more on adding depth and strength of will to the squad and man-management. McGinn, one of the most reliably effective players in the Championship last season, has already insisted that he remains committed to Hibs despite the failure to achieve promotion. The 21-year-old midfielder provides the kind of industry and spirit that a team can be built around. There may be critical decisions to make, though, since Cummings is entering the final year of his contract and so represents a sellable asset. He is a regular goalscorer, though, and Stubbs had to sign Anthony Stokes on loan last January to provide some support up front. These are tweaks compared to the amount of work Stubbs had to carry out when he was appointed two years ago. Hibs are ready to be guided forward, not waiting to be rescued.

It is usually served","But what's brewing in this new crop of commercial meaderies - as they are known - is lot more refined from the drink that once decorated tables across medieval Europe. ""Do we have any mead makers or home brewers in the group?"" asks Ben Alexander, eying a crowd of a dozen or so people who have come to his Maine Meade Works, in Portland, on a rainy Friday for a tour. When no-one raises their hand, Mr Alexander launches into the full spiel. ""If you guys want to come around, I'll show you how this thing works,"" he says, gesturing to two ceiling-high columns of stainless steel filled with something resembling a mushy golden porridge. ""We mix up honey and water over there and we pump it through a hot water bath at 160 degrees [71C] in a stainless steel coil here. Each one produces about 50 to 75 gallons [227-340 litres] of mead a day,"" explains Mr Alexander. It's fair to say he is obsessed with mead. ""It's the quintessential local beverage - you can go anywhere in the world and find honey to make mead, and I think that's unique among alcoholic beverages,"" he gushes. After being introduced to the drink by a home brewer, Mr Alexander thought there were profits to be had in a commercial meadery. He founded Maine Mead Works in 2008, pouring his savings and money from friends and family into the business. His business has since grown, along with the popularity of mead in the US. It's now a seven-person operation that manufactures more than 7,500 cases a year, shipping them as far away as China. Mr Alexander is not the only one to have caught on to the commercial potential of mead. Vicky Rowe, the owner of mead information website GotMead, says interest in the product in the US has exploded in the past decade. ""We went from 30-40 meaderies making mead to somewhere in the vicinity of 250 in the last 10 years,"" she says. ""I like to say that everything old is new again - people come back to what was good once."" Even visitors to Mr Alexander's meadery agree. Tour participant Dirk Heseman admitted that while Maine Mead Works was the first meadery he'd actually visited, he has noticed that mead ""is becoming more and more available - similar to cider"". Just this year, commercial meaderies in the US have banded together to form an industry group, the American Mead Makers Association, to better share information and encourage growth in the industry. But there's a lot of work that needs to be done to improve the image of a drink long associated with Renaissance fairs and medieval re-enactments. ""I think our number one challenge as an industry is awareness of what mead is,"" says Mr Alexander. ""You ask 10 people in a room if they've ever heard of mead, and two of them might say, 'yes', and only one of them has had a very positive experience."" The mead of the past was often sweet, and didn't appeal to many drinkers",1,3,3

The African Union is an","It was a ""good opportunity"" and ""a chance to work together,"" a top Western Sahara official told the BBC. Morocco controls two-thirds of Western Sahara and sees it as part of its historic territory. However some, including the UN, see Western Sahara as Africa's last colony. Africa Live: More on this and other stories Find out more about Western Sahara A referendum was promised in 1991 but never carried out due to wrangling over who was eligible to vote. Thousands of Sahrawi refugees still live in refugee camps in Algeria - some have been there for 40 years. It is not clear what happens next but Western Sahara is hopeful that a committee set up by the AU will address the issues that both sides have raised. Some AU delegates said that it would be easier to resolve the issue with Morocco inside the AU. Sidi Mohammed, a Western Sahara official, told the BBC that Morocco's return to the AU means that it would now be expected to put ""in practice decisions taken by the AU with regard to a referendum in Western Sahara"". Mr Mohammed dismissed the suggestion that Morocco would now seek to get the AU to change its position, saying that the no country could unilaterally change the AU fundamental agreement, saying it opposed colonisation. In his speech at the AU summit, King Mohammed VI of Morocco said the readmission was not meant to divide the continental body. No. Algeria has always been a big supporter of Western Sahara's Polisario Front and it had wanted Morocco to accept independence of the territory as a condition for readmission. Zimbabwe and South Africa were also supportive of this stance but they were outnumbered by those who wanted Morocco back in the fold. There is no specific provision in the AU charter that bars any country from joining it. Morocco simply applied and the request was accepted by more than two-thirds of the 53 members. Morocco has been involved in intense lobbying and applied in July last year to rejoin the continental body. King Mohammed toured various African countries seeking support for the bid. No. While culturally the country's identity aligns with Arab states, its economic interests increasingly lie in Africa. This is a strategic move to continue exploring its interests in mining, construction, medical, insurance and banking sectors on the continent.

At the party's weekly press briefing, I asked the Welsh Conservative leader Andrew RT Davies, who was elected on the list, whether he'd stand as a constituency candidate in his home turf of the Vale of Glamorgan but he said he hadn't thought about it. Presumably those are the kind of decisions they will now feel more confident contemplating. The party will also have a huge amount of new data on voters which it'll be able to call upon and the belief that campaigning hard on the NHS helped the Tories cross the line in places like the Vale of Clwyd and Gower. The Conservatives feel it's them, rather than any of the other opposition parties, who have become the repository of votes from those who are disaffected by the state of the NHS. Welsh Labour are going to hold a ""short sharp"" analysis into what went wrong. Carwyn Jones was in line with most of the criticism of Ed Miliband when he told AMs that the party needed to appeal to small business owners who are not millionaires but who work hard. What will be more difficult is countering the argument on the NHS, which the former minister Alun Davies believes is already lost. Another potential difficulty for Welsh Labour will be dealing with unhappiness within the party over council re-organisation. Bernie Attridge, the deputy leader of Flintshire Council, has tweeted saying the party needs to be careful on local government reform if it wants to retain the support of grassroots councillors. It also seems to have been the case that Labour lost more votes to UKIP than the Conservatives, which is another challenge to overcome. But Labour will at least have the advantage that it will be David Cameron, and not Ed Miliband, carrying out the latest round of public sector cuts that are likely to take effect sooner rather than later. The question is whether Carwyn Jones is going to be able to turn that to his advantage when his own record in government will be under scrutiny. Plaid Cymru's education spokesman, Simon Thomas, also in the party's weekly press briefing, said he believed Leanne Wood could portray herself as an alternative first minister because of the way she emotionally connected with people in the campaign.

The apes began to disappear from the documents about 150 years ago, corresponding with population growth. The study is published in the Proceedings of the Royal Society B. Hainan gibbons are now limited to a few isolated patches of forest in the south west of China. They live in just four social groups, one of which was only discovered a few weeks ago. Understanding this population crash has been difficult, but the old government documents have helped to reveal when and how the numbers fell. Dr Sam Turvey, from the Zoological Society of London, said: ""China is one of the few places in the world that has a very very rich, long historical record. ""Because it has had such a complex bureaucracy for so long, there has been a lot of need for reporting - not just numbers of households for tax purposes and things like that, but also in terms of the kinds of natural resources that were available in the immediate environment."" These included records of animals, including gibbons, he said. ""We looked at the pattern of disappearance of gibbons through time and how that varied from place to place and the different environmental conditions and human pressures that were also present in these places."" The archives show that gibbons were a common sight in about 20 provinces in China well into the 17th and 18th Century. However, Dr Turvey said it was ""a stark contrast to their very imperilled position today"". ""We see a really steep increase in population decline and real population collapse across China about 100-150 years ago,"" he added. ""And this correlates with demographic expansion in China towards the end of the Imperial era and through the 20th Century, and the massive increase in deforestation and human population growth through the time of the Chinese Republic and the establishment of the communist party."" The researchers said a better understanding of the animals' decline would help them to establish a conservation plan for the country's last few Hainan gibbons. Dr Turvey said: ""It is an incredible privilege to be able to see gibbons in China in the wild.

It is the first time that activity in the sector has fallen since March 2013. Firms blamed soft domestic demand, a fall in new business from overseas and uncertainty ahead of the EU referendum. A slowdown in the oil and gas industry, a major customer for UK companies, is also hitting production. The index for new orders fell to 50.4 in April, from 51.9 the month before, matching February's three-year low. Rob Dobson, senior economist at Markit, said: ""On this evidence manufacturing production is now falling at a quarterly pace of around 1%, and will likely act as a drag on the economy again during the second quarter and putting greater pressure on the service sector to sustain GDP growth. ""The manufacturing labour market is also being impacted, with the data signalling close to 20,000 job losses over the past three months."" Last week, official figures showed UK economic growth slowed to 0.4% in the first quarter of the year from 0.6% in late 2015, propped up by the services sector. David Noble, group chief executive at the Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply (CIPS), said: ""Recent fears over a stall in the UK's manufacturing sector have now become a reality. ""An atmosphere of deep unease is building throughout the manufacturing supply chain, eating away at new orders, reducing British exports and putting more jobs at risk. ""A sense of apprehension across the sector is being caused by enduring volatility in the oil and gas industry, falling retailer confidence and the uncertainty created by the EU referendum."" The Markit/CIPS survey found new export orders contracted for the fourth straight month in April as the global economy continued to slow. A measure of employment in the manufacturing sector was also below the 50 mark for its fourth straight month. Lee Hopley, chief economist at the manufacturers' organisation, EEF, said: ""The sharp drop to a three-year low and another month of reported job cuts could be the clearest sign yet that referendum uncertainty is starting to weigh on the real economy.

Mr Moores, 28, was killed by a Vauxhall Astra driven by Donna Hackett on the M4 near Swindon. Hackett, then aged 26, fled and was found by police asleep in a ditch. She served half of a six-year jail term after she was found guilty of causing death by careless driving while drunk. The Ministry of Justice consultation suggests offenders who cause death by careless driving while under the influence of drink or drugs could soon be handed a life sentence - an increase on the current 14-year upper limit.

Appointments affected include scans and consultations with specialists - including those for cancer patients. The British Medical Association said such incentives were ""misguided"". At least nine clinical commissioning groups (CCGs) were offering GP practices payments for hitting targets, according to Pulse's investigation. In one case, Birmingham South Central CCG was offering practices more than Â£11,000 to reduce new outpatient attendances, follow-ups, A&E attendances and emergency admissions by 1%, compared with 2014/15. It said the schemes, which exclude cancer referrals, were designed to ""incentivise best quality practice"" and ""drive improvements in the quality of primary medical care"". ""Our priority is to ensure that patients have access to services that they need, when they need them,"" said a spokesperson for Birmingham South Central CCG. Another CCG told Pulse it had considered the ""full impact"" of the incentive scheme and was ""confident that there is no conflict of interest"". Pulse said that one scheme had already been looked at by the General Medical Council, the body which regulates medical standards in the UK, after local GP leaders expressed their concern. The magazine pointed out that initial hospital referrals for cancer patients should happen within two weeks of a GP first suspecting the condition. Dr Chand Nagpaul, chairman of the GPs committee of the doctors' trade union the British Medical Association, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that such schemes were a ""financial contaminant"" to patient-doctor trust. He said: ""It's short-sighted and misguided of CCGs to introduce such mechanisms, because they do lead to the potential for patients questioning the motives of GP referrals. ""We believe it is far more appropriate for CCGs to introduce clinical pathways that ensure patients are referred appropriately rather than these crude, salesman-like bonuses which pay GPs simply to make reduction to referrals in numerical terms."" Dr Peter Melton is local GP and clinical chief officer for North East Lincolnshire CCG, which offers the equivalent of more than Â£6,000 to practices that reduce outpatient referrals to the same level as the 25% with the lowest referral rates (which include two-week urgent cancer referrals) in 2014/15. He said the CCG was already among the best in England for referring suspected cancer patients to a consultant within two weeks and the scheme was not about avoiding sending people to hospital.

Analysis by Vitaliy Shevchenko, BBC Monitoring The decision was made following two separate court rulings, which said the websites ""spread pornography"". Sexually explicit content is not outlawed in Russia, but the law bans ""the illegal production, dissemination and advertisement of pornographic materials and objects"". It is not uncommon for Russia to ban websites. The government agency Roskomnadzor maintains a blacklist that now includes thousands of them. Access is usually blocked for violating the notoriously vague extremism legislation or child protection laws. Websites critical of the Kremlin have been blocked too, and at one point Wikipedia was blacklisted. Following the 2015 ban, one woman asked Roskomnadzor on Twitter whether it could recommend an alternative. The agency replied: ""You can meet someone in real life."" On Tuesday, it said its earlier tweet was ""still relevant"". However, open rights campaigners have warned that local bans can be defeated. ""Blocking porn is the fastest way to ensure widespread adoption of censorship circumvention in your country,"" said Eva Galperin, global policy analyst at the Electronic Frontier Foundation. One of the affected porn sites offered Roskomnadzor a premium subscription to its service, in exchange for lifting the ban. The government agency said it was ""not in the market"" for such an offer. Nadya Tolokonnikova, lead singer from punk band Pussy Riot, joked that the ban was ""a blow below the belt"".",1,5,5
openai_curie (0 shot),The Scottish government is appealing against the Supreme Court's decision.,"John Swinney will address MSPs over a legal challenge to information sharing proposals within the Act. The system would appoint a named person - usually a teacher or health visitor - to ensure the wellbeing of every child. But judges at the UK's highest court ruled against the scheme in July 2016, citing concerns over information sharing. The Supreme Court judges said some proposals breached rights to privacy and a family life under the European Convention on Human Rights. However, the court said the aim of the Act, which is intended to promote and safeguard the rights and wellbeing of children and young people, was legitimate. Speaking ahead of his statement to the Scottish Parliament, Mr Swinney said the Scottish government remained ""absolutely committed"" to the Named Person service as a way to support children and their families. ""Last year the Supreme Court ruled definitively that the intention of providing a Named Person for every child to promote and safeguard their wellbeing was 'unquestionably legitimate and benign',"" he said. ""Their judgement did, however, require us to change the provisions relating to information sharing. ""Since the judgement, we have undertaken an intensive period of engagement with children, young people, parents, carers, practitioners and professionals. ""I will now update parliament on the next steps in this vital means of supporting, safeguarding and promoting the wellbeing of our children and young people."" The judges said in July that specific proposals about information-sharing were ""not within the legislative competence of the Scottish Parliament"". And they said the legislation made it ""perfectly possible"" that confidential information about a young person could be disclosed to a ""wide range of public authorities without either the child or young person or her parents being aware"". The appeal was brought by the No to Named Persons (NO2NP) coalition, which includes the Christian Institute, Care (Christian Action Research and Education), Tyme Trust and the Family Education Trust. The Scottish government has said previously it would not commence the legislation until the problems were fixed.",1,3,3
openai_curie (0 shot),The Scottish government is cutting funding to sports.,"sportscotland says it has yet to decide where the cuts will fall amid concerns that elite athletes could suffer. The cuts are being blamed on reduced government spending and a drop in National Lottery ticket sales - a major contributor to sports backing. Governing bodies are bracing themselves for potential job losses. About 60% of funding is made up from Scottish Government money, with lottery sales making up the rest. In the year ending 2015, total revenue was £65.1m, which is divided up and awarded to 52 sports. By the end of next year, that figure will have fallen to £51.8m - a cut to the Scottish sporting budget of 20% in just three years. sportscotland chairman Mel Young said: ""It's heartbreaking to me because I know the effort the sport governing bodies and the community that's around it; the volunteers and the mums and dads. ""And, to have to say that we're having to cut some money back is, I believe, not the right way to go."" Former badminton player Susan Egelstaff, a double bronze medallist at the Commonwealth Games [in 2002 and 2006] and an Olympian, fears the cuts will have ""a huge impact"". ""What that means in the future is that Scotland will be constantly playing catch-up,"" she said. ""It's almost impossible to catch up if you fall too far behind the leading nations."" The Scottish Government said sport and physical activity play a ""key role"" in a healthy Scotland and that ""significant"" investment would continue in those areas. ""Having successfully delivered the Commonwealth Games [in 2014] we are now focusing on protecting or raising investment in areas intended to decrease health inequality and improve life chances, and the small reduction in the sport budget allows us to support those priorities,"" Minister for Sport Aileen Campbell said. ""There is on-going support for active lifestyles through capital investment in cycling and walking, and over the last 10 years we have invested £168m in sport infrastructure - from grassroots to the elite performance which has increased the facilities and opportunities to get people active and achieve on the world stage at both the Olympics and Commonwealth Games.""",1,4,4

The decision is a major victory for President Obama, who has made the law a key part of his legacy. The court's decision was 6-3, with the court's conservative","In a 6-3 decision, the justices said that tax subsidies that make health insurance affordable for low-income individuals can continue. The ruling preserves the law known as Obamacare, which Mr Obama considers a major part of his presidential legacy. Republicans have vowed to continue fighting the law. ""We've got more work to do, but what we're not going to do is unravel what has now been woven into the fabric of America,"" Mr Obama said. The case, known as King v Burwell, was the second major challenge the law has faced in the US's highest court. Unlike in many other western countries, the US does not have a single-payer healthcare system. Private companies, rather than the US government, provide health insurance for US citizens. The enactment of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) - one of Mr Obama's most significant and controversial domestic achievements - in 2010 mandated that every American had to purchase private insurance. It provided the subsidies to allow many to do so. In 2012, the mandate portion of the law was challenged in the court. The justices ruled to preserve it. In that decision, as in the decision on Thursday, Chief Justice John Roberts surprised observers by siding with his liberal colleagues in support of the law. ""Congress passed the Affordable Care act to improve health insurance markets, not to destroy them,"" Chief Justice John Roberts wrote in the opinion. Justice Anthony Kennedy dissented in 2012, but sided with the majority on Thursday. Had the court made the opposite decision, an estimated 8.7 million people in the US would have been at risk of losing the aid that makes healthcare affordable. The stakes could not have been higher. People's health (crucially important) and Obama's legacy (less important, but for him and those around him fairly vital) were at stake. Well a politically finely balanced Supreme Court has given an emphatic, overwhelming vote in favour of the president by 6-3. I bet ""No-drama Obama"" is high-fiving anyone and everyone in the White House - that is how big it is. Obama defies lame-duck expectations Demonstrators gathered outside the court as early on Thursday morning. Reading updates on their mobile phones, the crowd became jubilant when they learned mid-morning that the court had ruled in their favour. Some began dancing, while others chanted ""If you're covered and you know it clap your hands."" ""This is a big sigh of relief for millions across the country,"" said Ron Pollack of Families USA, a health-care advocacy organisation. ""The ACA is not just the law of the land, it will remain the law of the land"". ""Today is a good day for healthcare in America,"" said activist Benton Strong. ""I hope this is the end of the line."" Demonstrators opposing the subsidies did not have a large visible presence. Justice Antonin Scalia wrote in his dissent that the Supreme Court is setting a precedent of favouring some laws over others. ""We should start calling this law Scotuscare"" Justice Scalia wrote, referring to the court's acronym. ""Today's interpretation is not merely unnatural; it is unheard",1,3,5

The permit does not allow the company to carry out fracking - hydraulic fracturing of the land - to extract any oil or gas. Fracking is subject to a temporary ban in Wales until decision-making powers on the practice are devolved. Natural Resources Wales said it had carried out a ""thorough assessment"" of the company's plans before approving them, with all work including reinstatement of the land to be completed within 12 months. ""It's important that any activity of this kind doesn't harm the environment, and this permit makes it clear what Coastal Oil and Gas Limited will need to do to comply with this,"" a spokesman said. ""Once the work begins, our officers will regulate and monitor the site to ensure it complies with the conditions of the permit, to protect people and the environment."" The permit for exploratory drilling comes despite a moratorium on fracking in Wales pending devolution of responsibility for such decisions. In August, the UK government urged councils in England to speed up the process of approval for fracking projects.

He said he would now look at the 125 existing marine protected areas to see if further improvements could be made. The Marine Conservation Society (MCS) described it as an ""embarrassing U-turn"" for the Welsh government, and has called for better protection of seas. Creating the zones would mean a ban on fishing and anchoring in some areas and had brought opposition. The Welsh Fishermen's Association said previously that existing conservation networks for Welsh waters are adequate. The Welsh government proposed the zones last year with the backing of the Countryside Council of Wales and the Marine Conservation Society. The minister for natural resources said the decision had been made after the thousands of responses to the consultation brought ""divergent and strongly held views"". Mr Davies said to ""avoid any continuing uncertainty over the options presented in the 2012 consultation, I am also withdrawing all the proposed sites"". His comments come after the findings were published of a task and finish team which reviewed the feedback. Now, he will concentrate on the existing 125 Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) that cover 36% of Welsh seas to see if any changes can be made rather than creating additional zones. ""We are now in a stronger position to assess our current contribution to the network's ecological coherence,"" he said. ""I have, therefore, commissioned an assessment of our current MPAs to identify if there are any gaps and what the options might be to fill those gaps. ""If any measures are required, I believe they should be simple, proportionate and fit for purpose."" Dr Peter Richardson, biodiversity programme manager for MCS, said the Welsh government ""spent an awful lot of time and money and encouraged other people to put effort into this consultation response"". He said: ""70% of the consultation responses were in favour of designating these sites and yet today the minister has announced he's scrapping the whole thing... bit of an embarrassing U-turn for the government I think."" He added: ""I think there are plenty of people in the fishing industry... that understand that in order to get the best yields from the marine habitats on which they depend, they have to be managed properly.""",1,5,4

The group has warned that 750 more foster carers are ""urgently"" needed to meet the demands of the care system. It urged people to ""open their hearts and homes"" to vulnerable youngsters. Currently, more than 5,500 children are in foster care in Scotland, living with 4,400 families and carers. The Fostering Network surveyed 250 children, teenagers and foster carers across Scotland and discovered that many young people had failed to find stability. Almost half were already living with their third family, a quarter were with their fourth family and about 20 were living with their 10th family since going into care. There was a particular need for homes to be found for vulnerable teenagers, siblings and disabled children, the study found. Carla, 23, was taken into care at the age of 12 and had eight foster homes before moving in with the Randalls. ""Looking back now I realised that the Randalls saved my life,"" she said. ""I never understood the extent of the neglect and abuse I had endured until I came to live with a 'normal' loving family. ""They were just always themselves, the smallest details meant so much to me. ""They nurtured a young, angry, untrusting teenager to become a positive, empathetic and successful young woman."" The Fostering Network said instability had a detrimental effect on the child's education and wellbeing, while finding a stable foster carer from the outset could lead to improved relationships and a happier childhood. Sara Lurie, director of the Fostering Network Scotland, said: ""As each year passes, we see more and more children coming into care. ""We need people who can open their heart, and their homes, to vulnerable children and young people and use their skills to help support them to reach their full potential. ""In particular we need people who have the skills, patience and passion to look after teenagers who may have had a really tough time and be facing some real challenges, and to offer them love, stability and security. ""A good foster carer will believe in the ambition of the children in their care in the same way they'd believe in the ambition of their biological family members.""

The finds are being shown to United Nations heritage experts, who are currently visiting Stonehenge. Archaeologists are concerned a planned 2.9km tunnel being considered for the nearby A303 main road will damage the site. Discoveries have also shown stones were warmed up by the Mesolithic Period inhabitants and used in a hearth to emit heat in the earthy snug. Mr Jacques, a senior research fellow at the University of Buckingham, has worked at Blick Mead for over a decade, making a number of discoveries about the inhabitants. The tree stump created a wall height similar to a ""modern bungalow"". ""They've draped probably animal skins or thatch around the basin and connected it to a post so it's a very comfortable snug little place,"" he said. The wooden wall of the hollow was lined with flints and the large earthy pit created by the tree root lined with cobbles and decorated with ""exotic"" stones from outside the area. ""There are some clever and sophisticated things going on, the hot stones that they put into this little type of alcove wouldn't have been on fire,"" explained Mr Jacques.

Lee, 84, has never explained why she stopped writing. She doesn't give interviews - ""Hell, no"" was her response to a request several decades ago - and that silence has only added to the intrigue. But her close friend Thomas Lane Butts, a retired minister in her hometown, Monroeville, Alabama, says she once told him the reason. Sitting on a pew in the Methodist church which the Lee family still attends, he described to me how she suddenly brought the subject up one night over dinner in New York. ""She asked me, 'You ever wonder why I didn't write anything else?' And I said, 'Along with several million other people, yes, I had wondered about that.' And she said, 'Well, what do you think?'"" Speaking in his slow southern drawl, the Rev Butts, who just turned 80, suggested to her that she had already written a great book and therefore didn't need to compete with herself. ""And when I got through she said, 'You're all wrong.' I said, 'Alright, smart Alec. You tell me.' She said, 'I would not go through all the deprivation of privacy through which I went for this book again for any amount of money.' ""And she said, 'I did not need to write another book. I said what I wanted to say in that book.'"" Harper Lee called it a simple tale about the ""conflict of the human soul"" and Monroeville, Alabama, is where she drew her inspiration. The story depicts the segregated South of her childhood, during the Depression. It was published at the height of the civil rights struggle. The Rev Butts grew up 10 miles outside Monroeville. By the late 1950s, he says, he was a ""fuzzy-cheeked young preacher"" campaigning for an end to segregation. He had met Martin Luther King Jr and signed a petition to boycott buses. The Ku Klux Klan had left a burning cross on his front lawn. He says To Kill a Mockingbird was not well received in Monroeville when it was published. ""The people who were hard racist did not like it because of the implication of the book,"" the Rev Butts told me. ""The book revealed racism and that always frightens a racist - when you pull the cover off them. ""Those of us who stood up for civil rights were much encouraged by the book because in a very skilful and subtle way it addressed itself for justice."" But these days, the Rev Butts says, there is enormous civic pride in Monroeville. The old courthouse, which Hollywood re-created for the film, now houses a museum to Harper Lee and the town's other literary icon, Truman Capote. Capote was a childhood friend of hers and is thought to be the inspiration for the Dill character in To Kill a Mockingbird. The town's residents often try to protect Lee, allowing her to live a normal life instead of being hounded by fans or bothered with prying questions. ""Being famous",0,1,1

The article is about how","Byron Rhodes is taking me around the modern council headquarters. It's full of light. It's busy. The building has regenerated the area around Melton Mowbray's railway station, once a muddy pot-holed piece of wasteland where those in the know parked for free. Now the council offices link the station to a park and the town centre. It was partly paid for with insurance money after a fire destroyed the old offices on the other side of town. A supermarket moved in to replace it and helped with the money too, putting the council on a firm financial footing. But that was four years ago and the crisis is a different one today. It's being experienced by all local authorities - cuts in central government funding which threaten the services they provide. Mr Rhodes is also deputy leader of Leicestershire County Council, with responsibility for finance. Leicestershire is historically the poorest funded council in the country because of a quirk of Whitehall recalculations, going back a quarter of a century since the poll tax, or community charge, was scrapped. At the moment councils get income from council tax, a share of the business rates, any income they generate themselves from services plus a grant from central government. It's the grant cut which is causing them grief. What's called the ""core funding"" is worked out by the number of homes multiplied by a set amount. And each authority has a different value set per dwelling. If we look at Surrey, which is top of the table, the amount will be £1,686 by 2019/20. Nottinghamshire is mid-table at £1,482, Derbyshire is in the lower reaches with £1,422 per dwelling and then comes Leicestershire at £1,354. ""The funding system is chaotic,"" says Byron Rhodes. ""It doesn't reflect real need. Look at Oxfordshire which is an interesting example,"" he says with a glint in his eye. Could he possibly be referring to the prime ministerial plea to the county council about cutbacks to services there? ""If we had the same funding as Oxfordshire, we'd have £50m a year extra. If we had the same as Surrey, we'd have £100m more. We'd be partying everyday if we had that kind of money."" Leicestershire have been helped with a small share of what's been called transitional funding - about £300m to help councils following pressure from Conservative MPs. Think back to the vote on Sunday trading. With a majority of only 17 in the Commons, the Conservatives lost the vote when 20 odd rebelled. Last month there would've been another rebellion, including some of our own Tory MPs in the East Midlands, if something wasn't done to improve the local government finance settlement over the next four years. The money has gone largely to shire counties. Leicestershire got £6.6m spread over two years, enough to save some services from closure. But it's a drop in the ocean for an authority with a £19m black hole in the budget every year after the latest cutbacks. Labour have protested that 83% of the councils getting transition funding are Conservative-run. Many Labour-run",1,2,3

The,"The group, reported to be three men, two women and four children aged from two to 11, was held at Reyhanli, in Hatay province, near the Syrian border. Their intention in travelling to the region, where areas are controlled by Islamic State (IS) militants or an al-Qaeda affiliate, is not clear. The Foreign Office has said it is in contact with the Turkish authorities. The BBC's Mark Lowen said the information about the ages of the children had not been independently verified and it was too early to know where the group were intending to head to. ""Were they heading for one of the more moderate groups in Syria. Were they heading for the area controlled by al-Nusra, the al-Qaeda affiliate? Or were they heading to so-called Islamic State territory?"" he said. The group was taken to a police station in southern Turkey overnight, and then sent to the foreigners department awaiting deportation to the UK. They have undergone medical examinations and had their finger-prints taken. The United Nations estimates the number of foreign fighters joining militant groups is more than 25,000, from 100 different nations. About 600 Britons are believed to have gone to Syria or Iraq since IS seized control of large swathes of territory there. Most are thought to have volunteered as fighters for the militant Islamist group. Around half are believed to have later returned to the UK, the Metropolitan Police has said. The latest detentions come two weeks after three British teenagers were stopped from travelling into Syria from Turkey. The three - two aged 17 and one 19, from north-west London - were arrested following a tip-off from British police and flown back to the UK. They have since been released on police bail. They had flown to Turkey from Barcelona and were arrested at Sabiha Gokcen airport in Istanbul. Fadi Hakura, Turkey analyst for Chatham House, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the recent arrests showed the Turkish government was ""taking more effective measures to control the flow of fighters and supporters into Syria"". He said there was now ""more enhanced security and intelligence cooperation between Turkey and its Western counterparts, especially with the exchange of names that Turkey needs to prohibit [IS supporters] from crossing into Syria"". The Turkish government has said it cannot make a 560-mile border watertight and will act when it has prior warning. In February this year there were recriminations between British police and Turkish officials after three London schoolgirls disappeared from Turkey, apparently having crossed the border into Syria. Shamima Begum, Amira Abase, both 15, and Kadiza Sultana, 16 had flown to Istanbul and travelled to the border region.

""We were [rehearsing] in the tent for about a week and a half, then we had to move to bigger studios in Hollywood where we are working on the rest of the show,"" she told Houston radio station Mix 96.5. ""And then we will send that equipment to Houston where we will finish rehearsals. Fans can expect a performance that spans my career so far."" She has a high standard to live up to - notably Prince's show in 2007, which took place in the middle of a Miami thunderstorm and is widely accepted as the greatest performance in the event's history, if not Prince's career. Here are some of the other most memorable - and surprising - moments from the last 30 years. Super Bowl performers get a very strict 12-minute time limit, so most performers cram their set with as much music as possible. Not Michael Jackson. After shooting onto the stage at the Pasadena Rose Bowl, he stood completely still, staring at the world for a full 90 seconds. Ninety. It was a master class in ratcheting expectation to a fever pitch. And the screams when he launched into Jam (not one of his best songs) proved he knew what he was doing. Brilliantly, Jackson staged this entire performance while wearing a jacket it looked like he'd borrowed from Muammar Gaddafi. Beat that, Gaga. Baby, he was born to run... and slide on his knees... and crotch slam a TV camera. In his autobiography, The Boss explains the incident like this: ""Too much adrenalin, a late drop, too much speed, here I come, Mikeâ€¦ BOOM! ""And I'm onto his camera, the lens implanted into my chest with one leg off the stage. I use his camera to push myself back up andâ€¦ BLAM! BORN TO RUN!"" It led to the memorable headline: ""America Attacked by Bruce Springsteen's crotch"" - but it didn't stop the star delivering one of the most powerful and energetic Super Bowl shows in recent history. Even if they were fined for over-running by 40 seconds. Coldplay were the headline act at last year's Super Bowl in Santa Clara - but someone forgot to tell Beyonce. She only performed one song, Formation, underscoring its message of black pride and power with back-up dancers dressed in leather body suits and black berets reminiscent of the Black Panthers movement. Some of her dancers were even pictured holding up a sign declaring ""Justice 4 Mario Woods"" - a 26-year-old black man who was shot dead by armed police in San Francisco two months earlier. The performance heralded the arrival of her unapologetically political album, Lemonade, later in the year.

The article is about the bid for BHS.

The article","BHS entered administration in April. Since then, efforts have been continuing to rescue it from closure and save the jobs of its 11,000 staff. Last week, a surprise late bid led by retail veteran Greg Tufnell transformed the race to acquire the retailer. His team, said to be backed by Portuguese money, is the front-runner. But if a deal cannot be struck, the business may still have to be liquidated. The remaining bidders have faded into the background. Another consortium led by Matalan tycoon John Hargreaves and Turkish retail entrepreneur Cafer Mahiroglu has reportedly run into difficulties, while other suitors have apparently failed to impress with their proposals. Some of those involved in the different bids have impressive retailing histories. But then Sir Philip Green, who controlled BHS from 2000 to 2015, also had a brilliant track record. And he ended up selling the business for Â£1. So what are the chances of saving BHS from the liquidators? And just who are the people aiming to do it? In the public eye, Greg Tufnell is easily overshadowed by his more famous brother Phil, the former England cricketer. But that could change if his bid for BHS is successful, because he hopes to become the firm's next chairman. And as far as his credentials for the job are concerned, the 54-year-old executive certainly talks the talk. He describes himself as ""a highly experienced managing director with Mothercare and Arcadia, a blend of entrepreneur, strategist and hands-on operator with significant commercial business turnaround, acquisition and fund-raising experience"". His record shows that he was buying and merchandising director at Next from 1991 to 1994. He then spent three years as managing director of menswear retailer Burton, part of the Arcadia group, followed by another three years as managing director of Mothercare. He currently appears to occupy a portfolio of different jobs, including the chairmanships of leather accessories brand Zatchels and recruitment consultancy hga Group. Earlier this month, he registered a new firm, Richess Group, at Companies House. Its other directors are Nick de Scossa, a Swiss banker, and Lisbon-based entrepreneur Jose Maria Soares Bento. Until Mr Tufnell's bid turned up, many observers had assumed that BHS would be snapped up by Matalan founder Mr Hargreaves. But it appears that the cost of a deal may have proved too high. Sources say Mr Hargreaves was asked to improve his offer and balked. Like Sir Philip Green, 71-year-old John Hargreaves also enjoys the life of the super-rich. He has an estimated fortune of Â£1bn, according to the Sunday Times Rich List. But in stark contrast to the ebullient Sir Philip, Mr Hargreaves is described by industry insiders as quiet-spoken, someone who shuns the limelight. Mr Hargreaves is no longer directly involved in the business he founded. He sold his 69% stake in Matalan in 2000, then in 2006 took it private through Missouri Bidco, a company 53.5% owned by him and his family. As a partner in Mr Hargreaves' bid, there is also Cafer Mahiroglu, the owner of Select Fashions. At 50, he is the youngest of",1,2,2

The article also said he had warned the PM the UK would have to pay its ""fair share"" and spend 2% of GDP on defence. In response, Number 10 said there were ""many difficult challenges"" in Libya, while the White House said it deeply valued the UK's contributions. Downing Street did not comment on President Obama's remark to the PM about defence spending, reportedly made before Chancellor George Osborne said the government would fulfil a Nato pledge to spend 2% of national income on defence last year. In response to the interview, a spokesman for the US National Security Council said Mr Cameron had been ""as close a partner as the president has had"" adding that ""we deeply value the UK's contributions on our shared national security and foreign policy objectives"". BBC North America editor Jon Sopel said the unsolicited statement put out by the White House suggested Downing Street had reacted angrily to the article. ""It's like we've seen a curtain drawn back on the unspun thoughts of President Obama, complete with frustration as well, and what we've seen tonight is the White House trying to close the curtain as quickly as it can,"" he added. The toppling of the Gaddafi regime in Libya - following UN-backed air strikes designed to protect civilians - led to a power vacuum and instability, with no authority in full control. The intervention was led by the UK and France - and in his interview, Mr Obama reflects on ""what went wrong"", saying: ""There's room for criticism, because I had more faith in the Europeans, given Libya's proximity, being invested in the follow-up."" Mr Cameron, he said, became ""distracted by a range of other things"". He also criticised former French President Nicolas Sarkozy, saying he had tried to claim the spotlight. The former French president, he said, ""wanted to trumpet the flights he was taking in the air campaign, despite the fact that we had wiped out all the air defences and essentially set up the entire infrastructure"" for the intervention. President Obama said the intervention ""averted large-scale civilian casualties (and) prevented what almost surely would have been a prolonged and bloody civil conflict"". But he added: ""And despite all that, Libya is a mess."" He also criticised what he called ""free riders"" in the interview, saying European and Gulf countries were calling for action against Gaddafi, adding: ""But what has been a habit over the last several decades in these circumstances is people pushing us to act but then showing an unwillingness to put any skin in the game."" Despite efforts to support Libya's National Transitional Council, and the first elections in the country for decades, it rapidly descended into violence, with two rival governments and the formation of hundreds of militias, some allied to so-called Islamic State.

Uhuru Kenyatta, who faces trial at the International Criminal Court, has been leading in early presidential results declared from Monday's tightly contested election. He is due to stand trial at The Hague next month for allegedly fuelling violence after the disputed 2007 election. He denies the charge. His closest rival is outgoing Prime Minister Raila Odinga. With provisional results in from more than 40% of polling stations earlier on Wednesday, Mr Odinga had 42% of the vote compared with Mr Kenyatta's 53%. However, Mr Odinga's allies remain confident that he will gain ground as results from his strongholds, including the Coast Province, are declared. More than 1,000 people were killed in the violence which broke out in 2007-08 after Mr Odinga claimed he had been cheated of victory by supporters of President Mwai Kibaki, who is stepping down after two terms in office. The BBC's Solomon Mugera in the capital, Nairobi, says Kenyans are becoming increasingly anxious about the delay in finalising the results. Some businesses and schools across the country have remained shut since Monday's election, he says. This has led to a shortage of goods, pushing up the prices of basic foodstuff in areas such as Kibera, the biggest slum in Nairobi and a stronghold of Mr Odinga, our correspondent adds. Uhuru Kenyatta Raila Odinga Profile: Uhuru Kenyatta Profile: Raila Odinga Some electoral officials have had to drive hundreds of kilometres to the counting centre in Nairobi to deliver paper copies of the tally of their returns. At about 13:00 local time, returning officers from only 53 of the 290 constituencies had arrived and the election commission said it would announce results from constituencies as they were ready. Its website had stopped giving updated results from the presidential race on Wednesday, and was still showing figures from Tuesday night. Our correspondent says the large number of spoiled ballots - about 6% of the total vote, well over double the number of votes cast for the third-placed candidate, Musailia Mudavadi - has become a major bone of contention. Mr Odinga's Coalition of Reforms and Democracy (Cord) wants them to be counted, but Mr Kenyatta's Jubilee Coalition is resisting this. Late on Tuesday, the election commission announced that the spoiled ballots would count in the overall vote total, increasing the likelihood of a run-off between the top two candidates, news agencies report. Mr Kenyatta's running mate William Ruto, who is also facing a trial at the ICC, said foreign embassies may have influenced such a decision. ""We want to believe that this is not an attempt to deny the Jubilee Coalition a first-round victory as is clearly now on the wall,"" he is quoted by Reuters news agency as saying.

Dance act Rudimental were escorted off the main stage mid-set, and had to abandon their planned encore - Feel The Love, with guest vocalist John Newman. ""We're quite upset,"" musician Amir Amor told the BBC, ""but we had a great time anyway"". Metallica's Lars Ulrich was flying into the site by helicopter as the storm descended. ""It was kind of frightening,"" he said. ""When we landed, all the people picking us up were going, 'we didn't expect you were going to fly in this weather'. ""But the pilot didn't say anything about that. We saw the lightning up there. I thought it was pyrotechnics for Arcade Fire."" The thunderstorm heralded a brief but torrential downpour, and the power cut took BBC coverage off the air. Music resumed on the main stage at 19:00 BST with Lily Allen, who dedicated an expletive-laden song to FIFA president Sepp Blatter. Other performers on Friday included Blondie, who proved so popular it became impossible to enter or leave The Other Stage at lunchtime, and Paolo Nutini, whose soulful ballads were a fitting soundtrack as dusk fell over Somerset. Sophie Ellis-Bextor sneaked some disco into her set at the largely-acoustic Avalon Stage, while the pulsing synthpop of Glaswegian band Chvrches made for a steamy atmosphere in the John Peel tent as fans danced off the downpour. Arcade Fire took to the stage shortly after 22:00 BST, their arrival heralded by a man dressed from head-to-toe in a mirrored suit. Bravely, considering the weather conditions, the 12-piece band were largely dressed in white, but if they were worried about laundry bills, it didn't show. They threw themselves around the stage, thrashing and spinning as though plagued by a swarm of invisible bees, each member switching instruments between - and often during - songs. As well as guitars, they played steel drums, xylophones and even a hurdy gurdy. Frontman Win Butler made frequent excursions into the audience and, during the song Flashbulb Eyes, plucked a camera from a press photographer and carried it on stage to capture the band's performance. The set list was evenly spread across their four albums, with highlights including No Cars Go, Neighborhood #1 (Tunnels) and Rebellion (Lies). The group's recurring subject matter of suburban despair and alienation might have seemed like an odd fit for Glastonbury's peace and love ethos, but there is an optimism and belief in humanity at the core of their music.

Ms Teal was previously arrested for protesting against the tree removals. Charges against her and 13 others were dropped earlier this year. More stories from across Yorkshire Sheffield City Council maintain that the removal of street trees in the city is lawful and necessary. A ""pre-action protocol letter"" from the council's legal department to Ms Teal warned the authority will seek a High Court injunction to stop her, and others involved in ""direct action"", from taking part in future protests. The council said the process would give protesters ""a chance to further and finally consider their position"" before it begins legal proceedings on 12 July. Councillor Bryan Lodge, cabinet member for Environment and Street Scene, said there had been months of ""unlawful and costly disruption"" to tree replacement works in Sheffield by a small number of protesters. ""We continue to support the right to peacefully protest, and the majority of protesters who are doing so peacefully will not be affected,"" he added. ""But there is a big difference between this and direct action which deliberately and unlawfully stops works from being carried out."" Mr Lodge said protesters had been sent a letter several weeks ago confirming their actions were unlawful. ""Streets Ahead is not just about street trees, it's about ensuring we have roads, pavements and a street scene to be proud of for many years to come,"" he added.

Mr Jacques said: ""British pre-history may have to be rewritten. This is the latest dated Mesolithic encampment ever found in the UK.

Det Supt Geddes said the seizure was significant ""both in terms of its size and its capability"". ""A number of these devices were ready to be deployed,"" he added. ""This seizure has undoubtedly saved lives."" He said the type of weapons that had been found meant police would focus their investigation on dissident republicans.

He admitted culpable homicide on the basis of diminished responsibility after saying he had no recollection of the killing at Dixon Avenue, Glasgow, on 24 September last year. Buksh will be sentenced on 27 June. The High Court in Glasgow heard that 43-year-old Mrs Buksh died after being struck on the head at least five times. Pathologists told the court that the lack of defensive injuries and the position of her body suggested she was assaulted as she slept. Following the attack, Buksh went to Cathcart Police Station and told an officer: ""I've come to hand myself in. I think my wife's dead. I hit her on the head. I did it."" The court was told that three psychiatrists described Buksh as suffering from an acute stress disorder at the time. Prosecutor Gordon Lamont said: ""The accused and his wife had been married for 25 years, but over the last 10 or 11 years their relationship appears to have broken down and they became increasingly estranged, albeit, still residing under the one roof. ""They slept separately and Mrs Buksh routinely slept on the sofa in the living room. Their children report that they barely spoke to each other."" Mr Lamont said the problems in the marriage intensified after Mrs Buksh went to Pakistan on holiday in May last year. He said she had become involved with another man and was making plans to move to Pakistan. The court also heard that two days before he killed his wife, Buksh went to Paisley Police Office and spoke with a support officer saying he feared his wife was going to take their youngest child, aged 10, to Pakistan and not return. He also made an emergency doctor's appointment and said he was suffering from stress and not sleeping. He was prescribed medication for stress. Defence counsel Sarah Livingstone said: ""My client has no memory of this incident. His amnesia is absolutely genuine. ""This is not a case where this man was a bad husband, there was no domestic abuse. This was an unhappy marriage, but however, unhappy it was it didn't justify killing his wife.

The law was approved by Russia's upper house of parliament in April. It includes measures to ensure that bloggers cannot remain anonymous, and states that social networks must maintain six months of data on its users. The information must be stored on servers based in Russian territory, so that government authorities can gain access.

Hugh Williamson, of New York-based Human Rights Watch, has called the law ""another milestone in Russia's relentless crackdown on free expression"". ""The internet is the last island of free expression in Russia and these draconian regulations are clearly aimed at putting it under government control,"" he added.

""The issue of banning all these platforms in Russia is a political one and it will be decided by only one person"", Mr Nossik wrote, with a thinly veiled reference to President Vladimir Putin. Earlier in the year, Russia enacted a law that gave the government powers to block websites without explanation.

It also says they should not ratify a similar deal that has already been done between the EU and Canada. It says some aspects pose a threat to democracy and the rule of law. One of the concerns mentioned in the petition is the idea of tribunals that foreign investors would be able to use in some circumstances to sue governments. There is a great deal of controversy over exactly what this system, known as Investor State Dispute Settlement, would enable companies to do, but campaigners see it as an opportunity for international business to get compensation for government policy changes that adversely affect them. This kind of provision exists in many bilateral trade and investment agreements. Friends of the Earth have published new research on the impact they have had on EU countries. Information about these cases is not always made public, but the group says that going back to 1994, foreign investors have sought compensation of almost €30bn (£24bn) from 20 states. Where the results are known (a small minority of the total), the tribunals have awarded total compensation of €3.5bn (about £2.8bn). In Britain, the possible implications of this provision for the National Health Service have been especially controversial. Campaigners believe that the investor tribunals would make it harder to reverse any decisions to contract services out to international healthcare firms. John Hilary of War on Want said: TTIP ""will make it impossible for any future government to repeal the Health & Social Care Act and bring the NHS back into public hands"". The petition lists a number of other areas where its signatories believes European standards would suffer if the TTIP negotiations are completed and the Canada deal is ratified: employment, social, environmental, privacy and consumer protection. The European Commission says the EU will not have to sacrifice its high standards. It also says investor protection provisions are important for investment flows and have in general worked well. But it accepts there is a need for improvement and is trying to achieve that in its bilateral negotiations. The petition has been organised as an exercise called a European Citizens' Initiative which can lead to a public hearing in the European Parliament and require the European Commission to give a formal response explaining why it is accepting or rejecting what the petitioners call for.

Following on, he then made 68 in Surrey's 166-3 to keep Hampshire at bay and prompt handshakes at 16:50 BST. The draw sees third-placed Hampshire claim 12 points, while Surrey take 10 points and stay sixth in Division One. Burns' epic effort saw him stay in the field for all but 10 overs of the entire match, as he defied Hampshire's bowling efforts on a flat Oval pitch. The left-hander was dropped twice in the slip cordon in his career-best 219, but was the only one to resist as Ian Holland (3-37) dismissed Tom Curran (53), Amar Virdi and Mark Footitt to force the follow-on after Surrey began the day on 410-7. Mark Stoneman (47) and Burns then put on an opening stand of 109 before Holland's medium pace had Stoneman lbw and Scott Borthwick bowled in a single over. Sean Ervine became the only man to dismiss Burns in 756 minutes of play when he missed a ball down the leg side, but Jason Roy and Dominic Sibley continued on until the conclusion. Surrey captain Rory Burns told BBC Radio London: ""I'm really pleased that we've fought that hard to get the draw and the extra five points, and obviously pretty happy with how I've played. ""We had to bat seven sessions to get us to safety and that's all I was thinking. ""There were some jitters in the nineties and I got a lifeline, which was quite nice. When I was getting close to 200, I was more thinking about the situation of getting to the follow-on mark. ""They're a good side and they played really well.

openai_curie (0 shot),The summit will be a great opportunity to expose and punish corruption.,"The international anti-corruption summit - the first of its kind - is aimed at exposing, punishing and drive out global corruption. Political leaders, businesses, sporting organisations, and charities will meet at Lancaster House on Thursday. Mr Cameron says corruption is ""the root of so many of the world's problems"". He also described it as ""an enemy of progress"". ""It destroys jobs and holds back economic growth, traps the poorest in desperate poverty, and undermines our security by pushing people towards extremist groups,"" he added. ""The battle against corruption will not be won overnight. It will take time, courage and determination to deliver the reforms that are necessary. But we cannot hope to solve the major global challenges we face without tackling the exploitation, fraud and dishonesty at their heart. ""For too long there has been a taboo about tackling this issue head-on. The summit will change that. Together we will push the fight against corruption to the top of the international agenda where it belongs."" Among the world leaders attending the summit are presidents Ashraf Ghani of Afghanistan, Juan Manuel Santos of Colombia and Muhammadu Buhari of Nigeria, and Norwegian prime minister Erna Solberg. Russia is to be represented by deputy foreign minister Oleg Syromolotov. Panellists are expected to include World Bank president Jim Yong Kim and International Monetary Fund's managing director Christine Lagarde. Under the prime minister's plans, leaders at the summit would pledge to expose corruption and pursue and punish those who perpetrate, facilitate or are complicit in it. Campaigners have also called for a crackdown on tax havens linked to the United Kingdom. The recent Panama Papers leak showed how some wealthy people use offshore firms to evade tax and avoid sanctions. A Downing Street spokesman said: ""We are in discussions with the Overseas Territories and Crown dependencies with major financial centres about their attendance, and expect a number to join the summit."" Robert Barrington, of anti-corruption campaigners Transparency International, said: ""The prime minister is creating a platform for governments that are serious about fighting corruption to make really significant changes and set the agenda for a generation to come. ""What is key now is that other governments are persuaded to sign up to ambitious targets and that the UK government does not give in to the usual last minute attempts by less committed countries to water down the summit's ambitions"".",1,3,3

openai_curie (0 shot),The woman's husband divorced her because she had fat face.,"Though the unverified story was short on details, and did not have the husband's side of the story, ""divorced because of fat face"" quickly became a top trend on microblogging network Weibo. State media picked up the story on Thursday, which was first reported in a local evening paper earlier this week. Liaoshen Wanbao reported the 49-year-old woman in Shenyang city had claimed her husband had divorced her 10 years ago because he disliked the shape of her face, said to be ""large and square"" with ""fat cheeks"". She said it spurred her to undergo facial surgery three times at a local hospital to shave her jawbones and reshape her face into a slimmer shape. During the third surgery the doctors discovered that if they proceeded further her nerves may be damaged, and halted the procedure. The woman, identified only by her surname Wang, later sued the hospital for 1.7 million yuan ($260,900; Â£183,900) in damages. She alleged the surgery had left her with soreness in her chin, and she could only eat and drink through a straw as ""when she exerted force on her lower jaw, she had the sensation that it would break"". The hospital, however, argued that the surgeries were conducted according to regulations, and pointed out that they encouraged her to seek psychiatric help instead of a third operation, which she refused. After mediation the woman agreed to accept 20,000 yuan ($3,100, Â£2,200) as compensation, said the report. On Weibo, some condemned the woman's husband, but others also chastised the woman. One top-voted comment read: ""It's purely an excuse, if her face was large then why did he decide to marry her in the first place? If he stopped loving her then he should have just said so."" It continued: ""This woman is also very silly to have believed that her face shape was the real reason for the divorce, she is lying to herself."" Said another Weibo user: ""Even if you had gone for facial surgery and made your face smaller, he would still have found other reasons to divorce you."" One person noted the sharp difference in the compensation amount and voiced suspicions: ""1.7 million was dropped to 20,000, it makes me wonder if she really did have a problem with her jaw."" Still others took the opportunity to crack jokes. ""What an odd reason for divorce! I wonder how square was this woman's square-shaped face? Like a television set? Microwave oven?"" Plastic surgery has long been a hot topic on Weibo. In December, users similarly expressed outrage when a Chinese man took out a newspaper advertisement pleading for his wife to go for plastic surgery. More than seven million cosmetic surgeries were performed in China in 2014. The industry's value, pegged at around 400bn yuan, is expected to double by 2019, according to the China Association of Plastics and Aesthetics.",1,4,3

openai_curie (0 shot),The writer was arrested for insulting the national anthem.,"Kamal C Chavara was detained by the police in Kerala state on Sunday after the youth wing of the Hindu nationalist BJP lodged a complaint against him. Last month, the Supreme Court ruled that the anthem must be played in every cinema before a film is screened. Some 20 people have been held in Kerala and Tamil Nadu since then for remaining seated during the anthem. Also, India's colonial-era sedition law has been often used against students, journalists, writers and social activists and those critical of the government. Reports said that the BJP's youth wing lodged a complaint against a Facebook post by Mr Chavara which allegedly insulted the anthem. The post was apparently an excerpt from one of his books. Senior police official Sateesh Bino told the NDTV news channel that the writer-activist ""is being questioned for his controversial post on the national anthem on Facebook"" and had been charged with sedition. Earlier this month, 12 people were arrested at a cinema in Kerala, after they remained seated while the national anthem played. The cinemagoers, who were attending an international film festival, were later freed but they face charges of ""failure to obey an order issued by a public servant, thereby causing obstruction or annoyance to others"". And at a cinema in Chennai, eight people who did not stand for the anthem were assaulted and abused, police said. The eight were later charged with showing disrespect to the anthem.",1,5,3

openai_davinci,A 20% cut in the Scottish Government's funding for sport has been blamed on a drop in National Lottery ticket sales.,"sportscotland says it has yet to decide where the cuts will fall amid concerns that elite athletes could suffer. The cuts are being blamed on reduced government spending and a drop in National Lottery ticket sales - a major contributor to sports backing. Governing bodies are bracing themselves for potential job losses. About 60% of funding is made up from Scottish Government money, with lottery sales making up the rest. In the year ending 2015, total revenue was £65.1m, which is divided up and awarded to 52 sports. By the end of next year, that figure will have fallen to £51.8m - a cut to the Scottish sporting budget of 20% in just three years. sportscotland chairman Mel Young said: ""It's heartbreaking to me because I know the effort the sport governing bodies and the community that's around it; the volunteers and the mums and dads. ""And, to have to say that we're having to cut some money back is, I believe, not the right way to go."" Former badminton player Susan Egelstaff, a double bronze medallist at the Commonwealth Games [in 2002 and 2006] and an Olympian, fears the cuts will have ""a huge impact"". ""What that means in the future is that Scotland will be constantly playing catch-up,"" she said. ""It's almost impossible to catch up if you fall too far behind the leading nations."" The Scottish Government said sport and physical activity play a ""key role"" in a healthy Scotland and that ""significant"" investment would continue in those areas. ""Having successfully delivered the Commonwealth Games [in 2014] we are now focusing on protecting or raising investment in areas intended to decrease health inequality and improve life chances, and the small reduction in the sport budget allows us to support those priorities,"" Minister for Sport Aileen Campbell said. ""There is on-going support for active lifestyles through capital investment in cycling and walking, and over the last 10 years we have invested £168m in sport infrastructure - from grassroots to the elite performance which has increased the facilities and opportunities to get people active and achieve on the world stage at both the Olympics and Commonwealth Games.""",1,5,4

openai_davinci,A church has been forced to put up with a colony of bats which are fouling its altar and furniture.,"A colony has been roosting in St Hilda's Church at Ellerburn, close to the North York Moors. But despite the church's best efforts the bats are not moving and are soiling the altar and church furniture, leaving the church with an ""appalling smell"". The creatures are protected by law and cannot be wilfully disturbed. Volunteers at the church have been working for the past decade to keep the altar, stonework and woodwork clean. But the bats, roosting in the higher areas of the church continually soil the interior of the building with urine and faeces. Church warden Liz Cowley said keeping the 11th Century building in good shape was difficult. She said: ""You can see the urine marks (on the altar), they won't go away. ""If people were coming in here damaging an ancient building like this, you would say it was criminal damage. ""The smell is appalling, it's a combination of ammonia from the urine and a musty smell from the droppings that catches at the back of the throat."" Members of the church had spent Â£10,000 trying to get the bats to move and had paid for specially-built lofts nearby. The Rev Paul Mothersdale, the Rector of St Hilda's Church, said a lot of money had been invested in trying to persuade the bats to move out of the church. The Rev Mothersdale said: ""We've tried to do everything that English Nature, or Natural England, have wanted us to do. ""Money has been spent, not only by the congregation, not only out of church funds, but local people have mucked in and helped. ""And yet we're no further forward, we're still as we were 10 years ago."" Lucy Bellini, of Natural England, said the bats had to be carefully monitored. Ms Bellini said: ""It is a really regionally important roost. ""Because of that we need to be sure that there are replacement roosts that are suitable and that the bats have found and are aware of and can move to before we allow the church to seal up access points and move the bats out of the church.""",1,5,3
openai_davinci,A college in Oxfordshire is cutting two of its degree courses and one of its postgraduate courses because of low student numbers.,"It comes after Ruskin College's governing body agreed to cut two of its six BA programmes and one of its three MA courses to save money. College principal Chris Wilkes said the decision was related to ""low student numbers rather than any other reason"". He said it would continue to focus on adult education. Famous Ruskin College alumni include former deputy prime minister John Prescott and Dennis Skinner, MP for Bolsover in Derbyshire. BA English Studies, BA History with Social Sciences and MA Women's Studies are being discontinued. Anne Hughes, 63, from Thame in Oxfordshire, has been studying BA English Studies part-time at the college for two years. She said she was ""absolutely distraught"" it was being cut. She is physically disabled and has depression, and said she chose to study at the college because it worked with ""disadvantaged, disabled and mature students"". The college also offers bespoke timetables, unlike some other places of higher education, she added. Online petitions have been set up in a bid to save the English faculty and the Women's Studies course. One signatory, Jenny Lewis, wrote on the first petition: ""[Tutors] Helen Kidd and Tom Sherry are carrying on the great Ruskin tradition of bringing opportunities to those that otherwise would not have them."" Student and activist Saskia Ritchie, who set up the second petition, said Ruskin had been set up for ""people who would traditionally be excluded from academia"" and gives ""access to truly excellent learning opportunities"". Mr Wilkes said the college would lose about 25 students as a result of the cuts. He added degrees had been on offer at the college for about 10 years and were ""relatively new"" considering the college's 116-year history. ""Our focus will continue to be on educating adults and I think what we're doing is just renewing our offer but doing it in a different way, fulfilling our mission in a different way, to perhaps how we've done it in the past,"" Mr Wilkes added. The college previously lost funding from the Skills Development Agency.",1,5,4

The permit for exploratory drilling comes despite a moratorium on fracking in Wales pending devolution of responsibility for such decisions.

Senior coroner John Leckey is retiring this year and told a preliminary hearing of the inquest in Belfast that no replacement has been appointed. His retirement could leave only one coroner in Northern Ireland. Kingsmill is among dozens of inquests dating from the early days of the Troubles that face delay because not enough money is available to investigate or there is nobody to oversee fresh hearings. Mr Leckey said: ""I feel for the bereaved families, not exclusively Kingsmill but for other inquests I am involved in. ""It is a disappointment that is widespread."" A lawyer for some of the Kingsmill victims' families said they would be pressing Stormont's justice department for more resources to allow an inquest to go ahead. Karen Armstrong, a sister of one of the murdered men, said the lack of resources was ""a political problem"". ""We are not going to lie down and accept it,"" she said. ""We will fight until we get another date and they have to make sure there are enough coroners in Northern Ireland to deal with our and many other cases."" Ulster Unionist MLA Danny Kennedy said he would be asking Justice Minister David Ford to ensure the matter was referred to the relevant authorities so that ""action can be taken as soon as possible"". ""Justice has been denied for almost 40 years and it is totally unacceptable that this inquest should be delayed further due to the unavailability of a coroner,"" he said.

Ms Teal was previously arrested for protesting against the tree removals. Charges against her and 13 others were dropped earlier this year. More stories from across Yorkshire Sheffield City Council maintain that the removal of street trees in the city is lawful and necessary. A ""pre-action protocol letter"" from the council's legal department to Ms Teal warned the authority will seek a High Court injunction to stop her, and others involved in ""direct action"", from taking part in future protests. The council said the process would give protesters ""a chance to further and finally consider their position"" before it begins legal proceedings on 12 July. Councillor Bryan Lodge, cabinet member for Environment and Street Scene, said there had been months of ""unlawful and costly disruption"" to tree replacement works in Sheffield by a small number of protesters. ""We continue to support the right to peacefully protest, and the majority of protesters who are doing so peacefully will not be affected,"" he added. ""But there is a big difference between this and direct action which deliberately and unlawfully stops works from being carried out."" Mr Lodge said protesters had been sent a letter several weeks ago confirming their actions were unlawful. ""Streets Ahead is not just about street trees, it's about ensuring we have roads, pavements and a street scene to be proud of for many years to come,"" he added. ""In addition, it presents us with a unique opportunity to sustainably manage, increase and maintain our diverse street tree stock over a 25 year period."" The council said, despite the letter, works were still being disrupted ""causing city-wide delays"".",1,5,5

One of the three people taken to hospital sustained serious but non life-threatening injuries, police said. The southbound carriageway has been reopened but investigations are continuing. The remaining passengers, who did not require hospital treatment, were taken to Abingdon police station. Passenger Rebecca Crow posted a picture of her injuries on Twitter and wrote: ""I was on the bus, it was insane. Very thankful for no fatalities; just a bust up face!"" The bus was a replacement for the 00:05 First Great Western service from Oxford to Didcot.

It was the first time the 32-year-old Spaniard had driven the car for the Oxfordshire-based Marussia team. Inspectors from the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) visited the test track on Wednesday. Marussia said surgeons at Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge ""embarked on a lengthy procedure to address the serious head and facial injuries sustained by Maria in the accident"". It said: ""The operation began yesterday afternoon and she was in theatre until this morning. ""Maria remains in a critical but stable condition.""

Formula 1 driver and BBC analyst Jaime Alguersari said in his weekly column : ""I was shocked to hear of the accident suffered by Maria de Villota. I know her and her family very well. I still don't know the cause of the accident. There are so many rumours but I want to wait to see what really happened. ""It's terribly sad. Maria is a fantastic person, as are her brothers and her father Emilio, who was one of Spain's first F1 drivers. ""She is a role model, especially for all the females who want to get into F1.

openai_davinci,A hosepipe ban means that a fountain in Welwyn Garden City has had to be filled with water from a lake.,"The Coronation Fountain, a landmark in Welwyn Garden City, had to be turned off due to the hosepipe ban. However, the council is now paying Â£450 to fill it up again, so that the town looks its best for key 2012 events. It will be working on the 4 and 5 June and when the Olympic torch relay passes through the borough on 8 July. The fountain on Parkway in the town was built to celebrate the Queen's accession to the throne in 1952. It is supplied by an underground tank, but had to be switched off after the water level dropped and could not be refilled. The council is buying water from a landscaping firm which already supplies water from a natural lake source, to maintain the borough's open spaces. It cannot be drunk so is permitted under the hosepipe ban regulations. Council chief executive, Michel Saminaden, said: ""They have told us that there is an abundance of water in this lake so we are probably doing them a favour by taking it."" Mr Saminaden added that the council decided against asking the Veolia water company for a special dispensation. ""I thought that wasn't the right thing to do because we would be using precious water,"" he said. ""What we are doing now is using water that is surplus and we have been told categorically that there is no problem in using it. This is a better all round sustainable solution. ""I am extremely pleased that we have been able to find a solution which will enable everybody to see the fountain in all its glory on the occasion of these two great celebrations.""",1,4,4

Rebecca Hilsenrath, head of the Equality and Human Rights Commission, said the remarks were ""truly disgusting"" as well as unlawful. Mr Wilson said it was ""not a colour issue"" but an ""economic judgement"". Speaking to BBC Asian Network, Mr Wilson, who has amassed nearly 1,000 buy-to-let properties in Kent, said a property he had bought from an Indian couple cost him about Â£12,000 because the curry smell became a ""massive problem"" and he was forced to rip up the carpet and take the house off the market for six months. ""If that makes me racist, that makes 99% of people who buy houses racist,"" he said. ""How many white people are going to go into a house that smells of curry and are going to buy [it]?"" The Equality and Human Rights Commission is investigating and says it will seek legal action where necessary. Ms Hilsenrath said: ""There are still deep inequalities in our society as our race report demonstrated and these comments show why. ""As a country we all assume we have left the dark ages behind, but clearly there is more to be done. ""We will investigate and will be asking Mr Wilson to explain his actions. Unless we are satisfied that he will not break the law in the future we will take legal action"". Kent Police also said it was working to establish if any offences had taken place.

The fire is being fought on a number of fronts and a police helicopter has been deployed to help survey the scene. Chief Fire Officer Lee Howell said it was a ""very difficult incident"" and his teams were struggling with wind direction and a lack of water supplies.

The police said that a post-mortem examination showed he died as a ""direct result of the injuries"" of the bomb. A dissident republican group, widely referred to as the new IRA, said it carried out the attack. The organisation said Mr Ismay was targeted for training officers at Maghaberry Prison near Lisburn, County Antrim. Sue McAllister, director general of the Northern Ireland Prison Service, spent time with the Ismay family on Wednesday. She said they were ""devastated and beyond shock at what's happened"". ""Like all of us, they thought that he was on the mend and was doing really well,"" said Mrs McAllister. ""We thought he would make a full recovery, we expected him to come back to work in due course, so we're all shocked, but particularly Sharon and her daughters."" Mrs McAllister condemned the behaviour of some paramilitary inmates at Maghaberry Prison, who reportedly cheered, smoked cigars and mocked wardens at the high-security jail when news of Mr Ismay's death filtered through. ""This was just unacceptable behaviour by a very small number of prisoners,"" said Mrs McAllister. ""My colleagues in Maghaberry dealt with it professionally, with great fortitude and with the courage they display on a daily basis."" She admitted she and her colleagues in the Prison Service felt ""very angry"" on hearing the reports of the celebrations in the exercise yard of the prison. ""We encounter challenging behaviour by a small number of prisoners every day, and we deal with it with great professionalism and we do not stoop to behaving that way in response,"" she added.

The first 999 call was made at 05:17 GMT but none had arrived by the time a second call was made at 06:44, ahead of a fire engine arriving at 06:50. Ms Wigmore's house, in Sussex Road, is about a mile and a half from Camels Head Fire Station. An inquest is expected to examine whether the delay played any part in her death, on 19 October. The fire service said in a statement it was unable to comment on the case until the inquest was over. ""We continue to offer the family of the deceased our deepest condolences,"" the service added.

openai_davinci,A man who killed his wife by repeatedly striking her over the head with a heavy blunt object has been found guilty of culpable homicide on the basis of diminished responsibility.,"Asghar Buksh, 55, repeatedly struck mother-of-six Nasreen Buksh over the head with a heavy blunt object which has never been found. He admitted culpable homicide on the basis of diminished responsibility after saying he had no recollection of the killing at Dixon Avenue, Glasgow, on 24 September last year. Buksh will be sentenced on 27 June. The High Court in Glasgow heard that 43-year-old Mrs Buksh died after being struck on the head at least five times. Pathologists told the court that the lack of defensive injuries and the position of her body suggested she was assaulted as she slept. Following the attack, Buksh went to Cathcart Police Station and told an officer: ""I've come to hand myself in. I think my wife's dead. I hit her on the head. I did it."" The court was told that three psychiatrists described Buksh as suffering from an acute stress disorder at the time. Prosecutor Gordon Lamont said: ""The accused and his wife had been married for 25 years, but over the last 10 or 11 years their relationship appears to have broken down and they became increasingly estranged, albeit, still residing under the one roof. ""They slept separately and Mrs Buksh routinely slept on the sofa in the living room. Their children report that they barely spoke to each other."" Mr Lamont said the problems in the marriage intensified after Mrs Buksh went to Pakistan on holiday in May last year. He said she had become involved with another man and was making plans to move to Pakistan. The court also heard that two days before he killed his wife, Buksh went to Paisley Police Office and spoke with a support officer saying he feared his wife was going to take their youngest child, aged 10, to Pakistan and not return. He also made an emergency doctor's appointment and said he was suffering from stress and not sleeping. He was prescribed medication for stress. Defence counsel Sarah Livingstone said: ""My client has no memory of this incident. His amnesia is absolutely genuine. ""This is not a case where this man was a bad husband, there was no domestic abuse. This was an unhappy marriage, but however, unhappy it was it didn't justify killing his wife. ""He suffered an acute stress reaction. Three psychiatrists all agree that he was suffering from an abnormality of the mind."" Judge Lord Burns deferred sentence on Buksh until 27 June at the High Court in Edinburgh for background reports.",1,5,5

The lookalike had recently moved to the town on the German border, police spokesman David Furtner told the BBC. Mr Furtner said this was not a joke or a piece of performance art. ""The young man knows exactly what he is doing,"" the police spokesman said. He said the man had also been spotted in Vienna and Graz. Pictures of the man were published by Austria's Heute.at news website on Monday. Glorifying the Nazi era is a crime in Austria. Last October, the Austrian authorities decided to demolish Hitler's birthplace house to stop it becoming a focal point for neo-Nazis. Hitler was born in a rented room on the top floor of the building on 20 April 1889. During Nazi rule, the house was transformed into a shrine to Hitler as the town drew in a wave of tourists.

Stage and TV actor Lord Rix, who specialised in post-war ""Whitehall farce"" comedies, is receiving 24-hour care in a retirement home. ""My position has changed. As a dying man, who has been dying now for several weeks, I am only too conscious that the laws of this country make it impossible for people like me to be helped on their way, even though the family is supportive of this position and everything that needs to be done has been dealt with. ""Unhappily, my body seems to be constructed in such a way that it keeps me alive in great discomfort when all I want is to be allowed to slip into a sleep, peacefully, legally and without any threat to the medical or nursing profession. ""I am sure there are many others like me who having finished with life wish their life to finish. ""Only with a legal euthanasia Bill on the statute books will the many people who find themselves in the same situation as me be able to slip away peacefully in their sleep instead of dreading the night."" The crossbench peer voted against an Assisted Dying Bill in 2006 because of concerns that people with learning disabilities might become the unwilling victims of euthanasia. He has been a prominent campaigner for people with learning disabilities after his daughter was born with Down's syndrome. He said his children were ""absolutely supportive"" of his decision and that he has ""wrapped up"" his affairs and was ""ready to go"" to ""put an end to this misery, pain and discomfort"". ""I can't do anything but lie here thinking 'Oh Christ, why am I still here?' They won't let me die and that's all I want to do,"" he said. He added the doctors and nurses ""do their best for me"" but that it was ""not good enough because what I want is to die, and the law stops them from helping me with that"". He had discussed with his children the possibility of travelling to the Dignitas clinic in Switzerland, but felt it would be ""unfair to them to push them into a situation where they are helping me to die"". Lord Rix said he had not been given an estimate from doctors as to how long he will live, adding: ""I think it's wrong that people like me are stranded like this.

openai_davinci,A petition calling on the EU to stop the TTIP trade talks has been signed by more than 1.5 million people.,"The petition calls on the EU and its member states to stop the talks on the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership or TTIP. It also says they should not ratify a similar deal that has already been done between the EU and Canada. It says some aspects pose a threat to democracy and the rule of law. One of the concerns mentioned in the petition is the idea of tribunals that foreign investors would be able to use in some circumstances to sue governments. There is a great deal of controversy over exactly what this system, known as Investor State Dispute Settlement, would enable companies to do, but campaigners see it as an opportunity for international business to get compensation for government policy changes that adversely affect them. This kind of provision exists in many bilateral trade and investment agreements. Friends of the Earth have published new research on the impact they have had on EU countries. Information about these cases is not always made public, but the group says that going back to 1994, foreign investors have sought compensation of almost €30bn (£24bn) from 20 states. Where the results are known (a small minority of the total), the tribunals have awarded total compensation of €3.5bn (about £2.8bn). In Britain, the possible implications of this provision for the National Health Service have been especially controversial. Campaigners believe that the investor tribunals would make it harder to reverse any decisions to contract services out to international healthcare firms. John Hilary of War on Want said: TTIP ""will make it impossible for any future government to repeal the Health & Social Care Act and bring the NHS back into public hands"". The petition lists a number of other areas where its signatories believes European standards would suffer if the TTIP negotiations are completed and the Canada deal is ratified: employment, social, environmental, privacy and consumer protection. The European Commission says the EU will not have to sacrifice its high standards. It also says investor protection provisions are important for investment flows and have in general worked well. But it accepts there is a need for improvement and is trying to achieve that in its bilateral negotiations. The petition has been organised as an exercise called a European Citizens' Initiative which can lead to a public hearing in the European Parliament and require the European Commission to give a formal response explaining why it is accepting or rejecting what the petitioners call for. The European Commission has already said that the petition doesn't qualify as such an Initiative. Campaigners have launched a legal challenge to this decision.",0,5,4

But he also raised concerns about possible damage to the site over plans to build a road tunnel past Stonehenge. The Department of Transport said it would ""consult before any building"". The Blick Mead site is about 1.5 miles (2.4km) from Stonehenge and archaeologists said ""scientifically tested charcoal"" dug up from the site had ""revealed that it dated from around 4000 BC"". David Jacques said the dig had also found ""evidence of feasting"" including burnt flints, tools and remains of giant cattle, known as aurochs, which were eaten by early hunter gatherers. Mr Jacques said: ""British pre-history may have to be rewritten. This is the latest dated Mesolithic encampment ever found in the UK. ""Blick Mead site connects the early hunter gatherer groups returning to Britain after the Ice Age to the Stonehenge area, all the way through to the Neolithic in the late 5th Millennium BC. ""But our only chance to find out about the earliest chapter of Britain's history could be wrecked if the tunnel goes ahead."" Andy Rhind-Tutt, a former mayor and current chairman of Amesbury Museum, which part-funded the dig, said the discovery could ""provide what archaeologists have been searching for centuries - the answer to the story of the pre-history of Stonehenge."" Earlier this month, the government announced funding for a 1.8-mile (2.9km) tunnel to remove congestion from the main road past Stonehenge. A Department for Transport spokesman said: ""As with any road scheme, we will consult with interested parties before any building begins on the A303.

openai_davinci,A social network in Egypt has played a key role in organising the revolution.,"This revolution is the result of someone sending a Facebook invitation to many people. I got it like other people on our network. The buzz around it was then created on different social media websites and with videos. I was here on 25 January when riot police forced us out and by the 28th, we were back following the violence. I've been sleeping here most of the time since. Our social network was established in 2005, when there was a democratic opening around the time of the presidential elections. People from different backgrounds all met through blogging and hoped to use technology for social change. It meant we have all gained good contacts, experience and strong networks. I like to think the social network is the people itself. Things like Facebook, Twitter, SMS and phones are just social tools. When they blocked Facebook and shut down technology, our network still operated because it's about people. Internet activists are also people and a lot of our organising, social work and relationships are developed offline. This is something that people dreamt of but didn't anticipate happening in reality. If anything, it shows that all the effort we put in over the past few years has not been wasted. It has climaxed into this critical mass of people you see in the square. At the moment I'm not getting a lot of internet connection. I'm trying not to drain my phone battery. We're still using it to distribute footage people are bringing to us that we've sorted through. I hope the internet will continue to play a complementary role in activism. At the moment we physically exist in downtown Cairo and I hope that when we have finished this sit-in, we will have won the right to organise ourselves outside the internet. Twitter: Amr Gharbeia I was involved in this revolution from the first day, 25 January, and I've now been spending my nights here for a while. For the past five years, I was very active online, blogging and tweeting. As we live under emergency laws in Egypt it has been very difficult to meet or communicate except on the internet. I'd never been part of a demonstration on the ground. At first we were mocking the event on 25 January. We questioned whether it was really possible to have a ""Facebook revolution"". I came on the 25th because I felt it was my duty as a citizen and I couldn't believe how it turned into something so different from what we've seen before. I was walking among the people and weeping. Now I sometimes just tweet to update people about what's going on or to call for a million-man demonstration or a day to remember our martyrs. I'm well-known among bloggers for my long articles and constant tweets, but once I was here I stopped communicating this way so much. I felt it was totally different to have real freedom rather than just hypothetical freedom or internet freedom. Blogging and tweeting has been important as we were building our minds.

A National College of Teaching and Leadership panel heard the allegations against him in November, although Mr Khan did not appear at the hearing. The Professional Conduct Panel has said it did not find the case proven. Oldknow Academy was one of several schools investigated amid claims of a Muslim hardliners' plot to control them; known as the Trojan Horse affair. More on this and other stories from Birmingham and the Black Country Mr Khan had been accused of agreeing ""to the inclusion of an undue amount of religious influence in the education of pupils"" at Oldknow, on or before 31 July 2014. The accusations had included telling some male pupils to change for PE in a cupboard so they would not show their thighs, banning children singing during a production of The Wizard of Oz and turning his back on a woman as she offered to shake his hand. He was also accused of sharing his personal beliefs with the children, for example telling the children they were not allowed pet dogs as they were Muslim.

openai_davinci,"A woman in China has said her husband divorced her because he didn't like her ""fat face"", but some have questioned her story.","Though the unverified story was short on details, and did not have the husband's side of the story, ""divorced because of fat face"" quickly became a top trend on microblogging network Weibo. State media picked up the story on Thursday, which was first reported in a local evening paper earlier this week. Liaoshen Wanbao reported the 49-year-old woman in Shenyang city had claimed her husband had divorced her 10 years ago because he disliked the shape of her face, said to be ""large and square"" with ""fat cheeks"". She said it spurred her to undergo facial surgery three times at a local hospital to shave her jawbones and reshape her face into a slimmer shape. During the third surgery the doctors discovered that if they proceeded further her nerves may be damaged, and halted the procedure. The woman, identified only by her surname Wang, later sued the hospital for 1.7 million yuan ($260,900; Â£183,900) in damages. She alleged the surgery had left her with soreness in her chin, and she could only eat and drink through a straw as ""when she exerted force on her lower jaw, she had the sensation that it would break"". The hospital, however, argued that the surgeries were conducted according to regulations, and pointed out that they encouraged her to seek psychiatric help instead of a third operation, which she refused. After mediation the woman agreed to accept 20,000 yuan ($3,100, Â£2,200) as compensation, said the report. On Weibo, some condemned the woman's husband, but others also chastised the woman. One top-voted comment read: ""It's purely an excuse, if her face was large then why did he decide to marry her in the first place? If he stopped loving her then he should have just said so."" It continued: ""This woman is also very silly to have believed that her face shape was the real reason for the divorce, she is lying to herself."" Said another Weibo user: ""Even if you had gone for facial surgery and made your face smaller, he would still have found other reasons to divorce you."" One person noted the sharp difference in the compensation amount and voiced suspicions: ""1.7 million was dropped to 20,000, it makes me wonder if she really did have a problem with her jaw."" Still others took the opportunity to crack jokes. ""What an odd reason for divorce! I wonder how square was this woman's square-shaped face? Like a television set? Microwave oven?"" Plastic surgery has long been a hot topic on Weibo. In December, users similarly expressed outrage when a Chinese man took out a newspaper advertisement pleading for his wife to go for plastic surgery. More than seven million cosmetic surgeries were performed in China in 2014. The industry's value, pegged at around 400bn yuan, is expected to double by 2019, according to the China Association of Plastics and Aesthetics.",1,5,5
openai_davinci,A writer and activist in India has been arrested for allegedly insulting the national anthem.,"Kamal C Chavara was detained by the police in Kerala state on Sunday after the youth wing of the Hindu nationalist BJP lodged a complaint against him. Last month, the Supreme Court ruled that the anthem must be played in every cinema before a film is screened. Some 20 people have been held in Kerala and Tamil Nadu since then for remaining seated during the anthem. Also, India's colonial-era sedition law has been often used against students, journalists, writers and social activists and those critical of the government. Reports said that the BJP's youth wing lodged a complaint against a Facebook post by Mr Chavara which allegedly insulted the anthem. The post was apparently an excerpt from one of his books. Senior police official Sateesh Bino told the NDTV news channel that the writer-activist ""is being questioned for his controversial post on the national anthem on Facebook"" and had been charged with sedition. Earlier this month, 12 people were arrested at a cinema in Kerala, after they remained seated while the national anthem played. The cinemagoers, who were attending an international film festival, were later freed but they face charges of ""failure to obey an order issued by a public servant, thereby causing obstruction or annoyance to others"". And at a cinema in Chennai, eight people who did not stand for the anthem were assaulted and abused, police said. The eight were later charged with showing disrespect to the anthem.",1,5,5

Earlier, every stage at the event was closed after lightning struck ground. Dance act Rudimental were escorted off the main stage mid-set, and had to abandon their planned encore - Feel The Love, with guest vocalist John Newman. ""We're quite upset,"" musician Amir Amor told the BBC, ""but we had a great time anyway"". Metallica's Lars Ulrich was flying into the site by helicopter as the storm descended. ""It was kind of frightening,"" he said. ""When we landed, all the people picking us up were going, 'we didn't expect you were going to fly in this weather'. ""But the pilot didn't say anything about that. We saw the lightning up there. I thought it was pyrotechnics for Arcade Fire.""

Sophie Ellis-Bextor sneaked some disco into her set at the largely-acoustic Avalon Stage, while the pulsing synthpop of Glaswegian band Chvrches made for a steamy atmosphere in the John Peel tent as fans danced off the downpour. Arcade Fire took to the stage shortly after 22:00 BST, their arrival heralded by a man dressed from head-to-toe in a mirrored suit. Bravely, considering the weather conditions, the 12-piece band were largely dressed in white, but if they were worried about laundry bills, it didn't show. They threw themselves around the stage, thrashing and spinning as though plagued by a swarm of invisible bees, each member switching instruments between - and often during - songs. As well as guitars, they played steel drums, xylophones and even a hurdy gurdy. Frontman Win Butler made frequent excursions into the audience and, during the song Flashbulb Eyes, plucked a camera from a press photographer and carried it on stage to capture the band's performance. The set list was evenly spread across their four albums, with highlights including No Cars Go, Neighborhood #1 (Tunnels) and Rebellion (Lies). The group's recurring subject matter of suburban despair and alienation might have seemed like an odd fit for Glastonbury's peace and love ethos, but there is an optimism and belief in humanity at the core of their music.

The city was rocked by riots in April when a black man died after suffering injuries in police custody. Six officers were charged over the death of the 25-year-old, Freddie Gray. Speaking at a news conference on Wednesday, Mayor Rawlings-Blake said Mr Batts had ""served this city with distinction"" since becoming police chief in October 2012. But referring to the city's high homicide rate, she said ""too many continue to die"". ""The focus has been too much on the leadership of the department and not enough on the crime fighting,"" she told reporters, adding: ""We need to get the crime surge under control."" The city has seen a sharp increase in violence since Freddie Gray's death on 19 April, with 155 homicides this year, a 48% increase over the same period last year. On Tuesday, the police department announced that an outside organisation will review its response to the civil unrest that followed Mr Gray's death.

His intervention in the debate - made, as he termed it, with ""deafening eclat"" - was even said to have helped cause the pound to slide on the international money markets as traders thought it made the possibility of a so-called Brexit more likely. He has arguably the highest profile of any of the governing Conservative Party except the Prime Minister David Cameron, but those outside the UK may be wondering: who is he, and is that actually his hair? Read on. Profile: Boris Johnson How could 'zip wire prat' become prime minister? Read more about the UK's referendum on the EU Alexander Boris de Pfeffel Johnson, to give him his full name, was born in New York and is descended from Turkish, French and German stock. He describes himself as a ""one-man melting pot"". He first made a name for himself in journalism, including a stint as Brussels correspondent for the right-wing Daily Telegraph newspaper and editor of The Spectator magazine. His humorous persona led him to become a fixture on various television programmes, including the satirical BBC panel show Have I Got News For You. He still has a lucrative and entertaining column in the Daily Telegraph, in which august forum he explained the reasons for his decision on the EU. As a politician, he has been a Conservative member of parliament for two constituencies, Henley from 2001 to 2008 and then Uxbridge and South Ruislip from 2015. Lest you think he was putting his feet up between parliamentary mandates, he is also currently serving the second of two terms as mayor of London, no mean feat in a city where the centre-left Labour Party has dominated in recent decades. That's indicative of the position Mr Johnson has carved out for himself as one of the most charismatic politicians in the UK who has wide appeal beyond Conservative heartlands - polling has suggested that his stance on the EU referendum may sway some undecided voters. Just look what happens when you type his name into Google.co.uk. Not quite. He has previously courted controversy for his remarks about (among others) the populations of Liverpool, Portsmouth and Papua New Guinea, not to mention run-ins with his own party leadership and TV chef Jamie Oliver. Last October he accidentally flattened a 10-year-old schoolboy at what was meant to be a friendly game of photo-op rugby in Japan. But none of this seems to have affected his standing among the party faithful or the public at large. Even getting stuck on a zip-wire during the London Olympics in 2012, a sure-fire route to derision for any other politician, only enhanced his eccentric image. Mr Johnson finally ended months of speculation about which side of the EU debate he would back in an immaculately impromptu media scrum outside his home in North London, having reportedly informed the prime minister of his decision earlier the same day.

openai_davinci,England were beaten by Pakistan on the final day of the second Test despite a brave fightback.,"Pakistan seemed to be cruising to a draw before debutant Adil Rashid - who returned 0-163 in the first innings - turned the match with five wickets. Needing 99 to win, England sent out Jos Buttler and Ben Stokes in the top four. But they were eventually beaten by the fading light, finishing 25 runs short of a famous victory on 74-4. The tourists could not find the boundary frequently enough before the umpires brought the teams off, with Joe Root 33 not out. However, this was a hugely impressive performance from England and one that will fill them with confidence ahead of the second Test in Dubai, which begins on Thursday. After England concluded their innings on 598-9 in the morning, Pakistan looked assured at 113-3 shortly after tea, leading by 38 with seven second-innings wickets remaining. But the match turned when veteran batsman Younus Khan, playing in his 102nd Test match, mistimed a wild heave to give Rashid his first Test wicket - caught at point by Stokes. Rashid - whose figures in the first innings were the worst ever by a debutant - then quickly added a second victim, having Asad Shafiq caught behind for six. The door was opened for England, and Rashid and Moeen Ali barged through it as they polished off the last five wickets for 14 runs. Pakistan skipper Misbah ul-Haq - who had played with restraint for his 51 - inexplicably aimed an uncharacteristic slog at Moeen and was bowled. Moeen then removed Wahab Riaz caught behind, before Rashid claimed the final three wickets - all superbly caught at first slip by James Anderson. England sensed an unlikely victory, but their reorganised batting order could not score quickly enough as Pakistan's tactic of spin from both ends and fielders on the boundary brought them regular wickets. Makeshift opener Buttler was trapped lbw for four, Moeen and Stokes were caught on the boundary in quick succession, and Jonny Bairstow was stumped attempting a big shot. However, in truth it was mistakes earlier in the match that ultimately proved more costly as England fell just short of their first win on the subcontinent since beating India in Kolkata in 2012. In Pakistan's first innings, Ian Bell dropped Mohammad Hafeez (98) and Shafiq (107) at slip early in their innings. And Shoaib Malik, who made 245, was dismissed off a no-ball by Stuart Broad. England captain Alastair Cook, whose record-breaking 263 in the first innings was ultimately in vain, admitted England were frustrated to come so close to victory. ""We'd have liked another three or four overs at the end but that's the way it goes,"" he said. ""I can't fault the guys for hanging in there on that wicket.

openai_davinci,GPs are being paid to reduce the number of patient referrals to hospitals.,"GP practices are being paid to help local NHS groups limit the number of patient referrals and cut costs, the doctors' magazine Pulse found. Appointments affected include scans and consultations with specialists - including those for cancer patients. The British Medical Association said such incentives were ""misguided"". At least nine clinical commissioning groups (CCGs) were offering GP practices payments for hitting targets, according to Pulse's investigation. In one case, Birmingham South Central CCG was offering practices more than Â£11,000 to reduce new outpatient attendances, follow-ups, A&E attendances and emergency admissions by 1%, compared with 2014/15. It said the schemes, which exclude cancer referrals, were designed to ""incentivise best quality practice"" and ""drive improvements in the quality of primary medical care"". ""Our priority is to ensure that patients have access to services that they need, when they need them,"" said a spokesperson for Birmingham South Central CCG. Another CCG told Pulse it had considered the ""full impact"" of the incentive scheme and was ""confident that there is no conflict of interest"". Pulse said that one scheme had already been looked at by the General Medical Council, the body which regulates medical standards in the UK, after local GP leaders expressed their concern. The magazine pointed out that initial hospital referrals for cancer patients should happen within two weeks of a GP first suspecting the condition. Dr Chand Nagpaul, chairman of the GPs committee of the doctors' trade union the British Medical Association, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that such schemes were a ""financial contaminant"" to patient-doctor trust. He said: ""It's short-sighted and misguided of CCGs to introduce such mechanisms, because they do lead to the potential for patients questioning the motives of GP referrals. ""We believe it is far more appropriate for CCGs to introduce clinical pathways that ensure patients are referred appropriately rather than these crude, salesman-like bonuses which pay GPs simply to make reduction to referrals in numerical terms."" Dr Peter Melton is local GP and clinical chief officer for North East Lincolnshire CCG, which offers the equivalent of more than Â£6,000 to practices that reduce outpatient referrals to the same level as the 25% with the lowest referral rates (which include two-week urgent cancer referrals) in 2014/15.

openai_davinci,"Harper Lee, the author of To Kill a Mockingbird, has revealed that she stopped writing because she didn't want to go through the ""deprivation of privacy"" she had endured while writing her only novel.","Harper Lee's classic was published 50 years ago this summer and it remains the only novel she ever wrote. Lee, 84, has never explained why she stopped writing. She doesn't give interviews - ""Hell, no"" was her response to a request several decades ago - and that silence has only added to the intrigue. But her close friend Thomas Lane Butts, a retired minister in her hometown, Monroeville, Alabama, says she once told him the reason. Sitting on a pew in the Methodist church which the Lee family still attends, he described to me how she suddenly brought the subject up one night over dinner in New York. ""She asked me, 'You ever wonder why I didn't write anything else?' And I said, 'Along with several million other people, yes, I had wondered about that.' And she said, 'Well, what do you think?'"" Speaking in his slow southern drawl, the Rev Butts, who just turned 80, suggested to her that she had already written a great book and therefore didn't need to compete with herself. ""And when I got through she said, 'You're all wrong.' I said, 'Alright, smart Alec. You tell me.' She said, 'I would not go through all the deprivation of privacy through which I went for this book again for any amount of money.' ""And she said, 'I did not need to write another book. I said what I wanted to say in that book.'"" Harper Lee called it a simple tale about the ""conflict of the human soul"" and Monroeville, Alabama, is where she drew her inspiration. The story depicts the segregated South of her childhood, during the Depression. It was published at the height of the civil rights struggle. The Rev Butts grew up 10 miles outside Monroeville. By the late 1950s, he says, he was a ""fuzzy-cheeked young preacher"" campaigning for an end to segregation. He had met Martin Luther King Jr and signed a petition to boycott buses. The Ku Klux Klan had left a burning cross on his front lawn. He says To Kill a Mockingbird was not well received in Monroeville when it was published. ""The people who were hard racist did not like it because of the implication of the book,"" the Rev Butts told me. ""The book revealed racism and that always frightens a racist - when you pull the cover off them. ""Those of us who stood up for civil rights were much encouraged by the book because in a very skilful and subtle way it addressed itself for justice."" But these days, the Rev Butts says, there is enormous civic pride in Monroeville. The old courthouse, which Hollywood re-created for the film, now houses a museum to Harper Lee and the town's other literary icon, Truman Capote. Capote was a childhood friend of hers and is thought to be the inspiration for the Dill character in To Kill a Mockingbird. The town's residents often try to protect Lee, allowing her to live a normal life instead of being hounded by fans or bothered with prying questions. ""Being famous",1,5,5
openai_davinci,Hibs have appointed Neil Lennon as their new manager after a spell in charge of Celtic.,"His previous jobs were at Celtic and Bolton, but moving to the second tier of Scottish football was no hindrance to him returning to work at Easter Road. Lennon saw the vacancy as an opportunity, and that was enough to encourage Hibs that a figure of his profile and experience would accept a role in the Championship. Even though his last job in Scotland involved leading a team on Champions League duty, Lennon's mind has not been swayed by haughtiness. The appointment of the former Celtic manager as successor to Alan Stubbs suits both parties, because it is mutually beneficial. Success is alluring, and Hibs offer Lennon the chance to accumulate more achievements. He was immediately engaged in crisis management at his previous club Bolton, but will find stability, potential and accomplishment at Easter Road. The demand will be to deliver promotion, but that will not seem daunting when the majority of the squad that pushed Rangers for a while last season then won the Scottish Cup is still in place. Lennon's task is to refine and bolster the team, when new managers are often faced with a period of overhaul. Stubbs left the club on an emotional high after delivering their first Scottish Cup in 114 years, but before the final against Rangers there was a tangible sense of exasperation that promotion had been missed. Hibs were entitled to feel that it was an unnecessary failure given their circumstances. The club is about to embark on a third season in the Championship, but by most other measures they can be considered a top-flight outfit. The budget will be significantly more than the rest of the teams in the division, the training ground at East Mains and facilities are first-class, the football side of the business is stable and well-run by George Craig, the club's head of football operations, the squad is full of talent. Lennon can rely on consistently assured performances from the likes of David Gray, Darren McGregor, Paul Hanlon, Lewis Stevenson, John McGinn, Fraser Fyvie, Dylan McGeouch, James Keatings and Jason Cummings. Some minor issues remain, such as who will fill the goal next season, but the challenge is more on adding depth and strength of will to the squad and man-management. McGinn, one of the most reliably effective players in the Championship last season, has already insisted that he remains committed to Hibs despite the failure to achieve promotion. The 21-year-old midfielder provides the kind of industry and spirit that a team can be built around. There may be critical decisions to make, though, since Cummings is entering the final year of his contract and so represents a sellable asset. He is a regular goalscorer, though, and Stubbs had to sign Anthony Stokes on loan last January to provide some support up front. These are tweaks compared to the amount of work Stubbs had to carry out when he was appointed two years ago. Hibs are ready to be guided forward, not waiting to be rescued. When Lennon left Celtic two years ago, it was to pursue a",1,5,4

That is down from 6.1% in the previous quarter. Analysts were expecting the same figure for January to March. India is the third-largest economy in Asia but has been struggling with inflation and currency weakness. Since July last year, the Indian rupee has seen one of the biggest declines among Asian currencies, dropping more than 27% against the US dollar. ""Shocking numbers as growth was even lower than lows witnessed during the financial crisis,"" said Anubhuti Sahay from Standard Chartered Bank in Mumbai. The BBC's Yogita Limaye in Mumbai said that just a year ago India was aspiring for double-digit growth. But a global slowdown has reduced external demand, and high inflation coupled with a weak rupee has made things more expensive within the country. Domestic demand, which India's economy is largely reliant on, has also slowed in part due to the political upheaval in the country. India's economy is suffering from ""policy incoherence, shifting global risk appetite and a comatose government"", said Rajeev Malik, senior economist at brokerage CLSA India's Prime Minister Manmohan Singh admitted early this month that his government must do more to get the once fast-growing economy moving again. The Congress-led coalition government is caught up in a slew of corruption scandals. Key policy reforms, including allowing foreign investment in India's retail sector, have been delayed in parliament for more than a year. This has worried foreign investors and threatened the country's investment grade credit rating.

openai_davinci,Leicestershire County Council is struggling to cope with cuts in central government funding.,"Byron Rhodes is taking me around the modern council headquarters. It's full of light. It's busy. The building has regenerated the area around Melton Mowbray's railway station, once a muddy pot-holed piece of wasteland where those in the know parked for free. Now the council offices link the station to a park and the town centre. It was partly paid for with insurance money after a fire destroyed the old offices on the other side of town. A supermarket moved in to replace it and helped with the money too, putting the council on a firm financial footing. But that was four years ago and the crisis is a different one today. It's being experienced by all local authorities - cuts in central government funding which threaten the services they provide. Mr Rhodes is also deputy leader of Leicestershire County Council, with responsibility for finance. Leicestershire is historically the poorest funded council in the country because of a quirk of Whitehall recalculations, going back a quarter of a century since the poll tax, or community charge, was scrapped. At the moment councils get income from council tax, a share of the business rates, any income they generate themselves from services plus a grant from central government. It's the grant cut which is causing them grief. What's called the ""core funding"" is worked out by the number of homes multiplied by a set amount. And each authority has a different value set per dwelling. If we look at Surrey, which is top of the table, the amount will be £1,686 by 2019/20. Nottinghamshire is mid-table at £1,482, Derbyshire is in the lower reaches with £1,422 per dwelling and then comes Leicestershire at £1,354. ""The funding system is chaotic,"" says Byron Rhodes. ""It doesn't reflect real need. Look at Oxfordshire which is an interesting example,"" he says with a glint in his eye. Could he possibly be referring to the prime ministerial plea to the county council about cutbacks to services there? ""If we had the same funding as Oxfordshire, we'd have £50m a year extra. If we had the same as Surrey, we'd have £100m more. We'd be partying everyday if we had that kind of money."" Leicestershire have been helped with a small share of what's been called transitional funding - about £300m to help councils following pressure from Conservative MPs. Think back to the vote on Sunday trading. With a majority of only 17 in the Commons, the Conservatives lost the vote when 20 odd rebelled. Last month there would've been another rebellion, including some of our own Tory MPs in the East Midlands, if something wasn't done to improve the local government finance settlement over the next four years. The money has gone largely to shire counties. Leicestershire got £6.6m spread over two years, enough to save some services from closure. But it's a drop in the ocean for an authority with a £19m black hole in the budget every year after the latest cutbacks. Labour have protested that 83% of the councils getting transition funding are Conservative-run. Many Labour-run",1,5,5

Morocco controls two-thirds of Western Sahara and sees it as part of its historic territory. However some, including the UN, see Western Sahara as Africa's last colony. Africa Live: More on this and other stories Find out more about Western Sahara A referendum was promised in 1991 but never carried out due to wrangling over who was eligible to vote. Thousands of Sahrawi refugees still live in refugee camps in Algeria - some have been there for 40 years. It is not clear what happens next but Western Sahara is hopeful that a committee set up by the AU will address the issues that both sides have raised. Some AU delegates said that it would be easier to resolve the issue with Morocco inside the AU. Sidi Mohammed, a Western Sahara official, told the BBC that Morocco's return to the AU means that it would now be expected to put ""in practice decisions taken by the AU with regard to a referendum in Western Sahara"". Mr Mohammed dismissed the suggestion that Morocco would now seek to get the AU to change its position, saying that the no country could unilaterally change the AU fundamental agreement, saying it opposed colonisation. In his speech at the AU summit, King Mohammed VI of Morocco said the readmission was not meant to divide the continental body. No. Algeria has always been a big supporter of Western Sahara's Polisario Front and it had wanted Morocco to accept independence of the territory as a condition for readmission. Zimbabwe and South Africa were also supportive of this stance but they were outnumbered by those who wanted Morocco back in the fold. There is no specific provision in the AU charter that bars any country from joining it. Morocco simply applied and the request was accepted by more than two-thirds of the 53 members. Morocco has been involved in intense lobbying and applied in July last year to rejoin the continental body. King Mohammed toured various African countries seeking support for the bid. No. While culturally the country's identity aligns with Arab states, its economic interests increasingly lie in Africa. This is a strategic move to continue exploring its interests in mining, construction, medical, insurance and banking sectors on the continent.

He added: ""We have a lot of beautiful things to fight for and to qualify for the Champions League will be a huge success. But we have to be honest with ourselves. We were not good enough to compete for the Premier League [title]."" Defeat at Stamford Bridge left City just four points ahead of Arsenal and Manchester United, both of whom have a game in hand. With the FA Cup being City's only realistic chance of winning a trophy this term, it is likely to be the worst season of Guardiola's managerial career.

There have been conflicting claims about the precise nature of the row, but stewards were needed to calm the situation down after Chelsea's 2-1 win. The incident centred around a disagreement between Chelsea fitness coach Paolo Bertelli and Manchester City masseur Mark Sertori, both of whom speak Italian, as the Premier League leaders celebrated their victory. Guardiola said: ""We are so polite in our defeats and we are so polite when we win. When we win, normally we celebrate a little bit, then we go to the locker room.

But his power, timing and focus returned in a supremely confident display at Glasgow's Hydro on Saturday night as he clinched the vacant WBA World Super-Lightweight title - and entered the record books as the first Scot to win world titles at three weights. Italy's Michele Di Rocco, at 34 a year older than Burns, hadn't lost a fight since September 2007. He arrived with a record of 40 wins and a draw from 42 bouts. He left a lesser figure. The referee deemed the man from Assisi to be in no state to continue in the eighth round, the result of a welter of blows to his head and body and made all the more unbearable by the hostile acoustic energy generated by 8,000 Scottish fans. Surely, for Burns, this was time to shout about his record, the ideal moment to counter all those who had written him off and questioned the wisdom of him leaving trainer Billy Nelson two years ago to work with Tony Sim in Essex? No. Instead, the champion spoke of his disbelief at the ease of his victory, his gratitude that he was safe, of his thanks to promoter Eddie Hearn, manager Alex Morrison and coach Sim for believing in him, and of his desire to celebrate with a fast-food burger and 20 chicken nuggets. ""When I got in the ring after the fight, I said, 'You've done it! You've done it!',"" reported a beaming Hearn at the post-fight media conference. ""And you know what Ricky said? 'Can you get a picture with me and Michael Buffer [the legendary American boxing ring announcer]?'"" When he has time to reflect during a well-earned holiday, Burns will take immense satisfaction at being only the third British-born fighter, after Bob Fitzsimmons and Duke McKenzie, to be a three-weight world champion. In Scottish terms, his achievements must mean that he is in the very top tier of boxing greats, comfortably mentioned in the same breath as former world champions Benny Lynch, Walter McGowan, Jackie Paterson, Ken Buchanan and Jim Watt, for example. Burns' record stands at 40 wins from 46 bouts. Remarkably, 11 of those have been world title fights. Buchanan's exploits in the United States add lustre to his legacy, but while Burns may never have fought someone like Roberto Duran, should Hearn manage to set up a bout against Cincinnati's Adrien Broner, the four-time world champion stripped of the WBA title because he could not make the weight, then Burns could achieve little more in the sport. ""There are some big fights out there for me,"" said Burns. ""I want to fight the top names. I will fight anybody. I do super-lightweight comfortably and lightweight is still an option. I would fight Terence Crawford again if it came down to it. ""That's nearly two years I have been with Tony and things have just started clicking.

In 2015, the authorities banned 11 popular pornography websites, saying many failed to protect children ""from information harmful to their health"". Analysis by Vitaliy Shevchenko, BBC Monitoring The decision was made following two separate court rulings, which said the websites ""spread pornography"". Sexually explicit content is not outlawed in Russia, but the law bans ""the illegal production, dissemination and advertisement of pornographic materials and objects"". It is not uncommon for Russia to ban websites. The government agency Roskomnadzor maintains a blacklist that now includes thousands of them. Access is usually blocked for violating the notoriously vague extremism legislation or child protection laws. Websites critical of the Kremlin have been blocked too, and at one point Wikipedia was blacklisted. Following the 2015 ban, one woman asked Roskomnadzor on Twitter whether it could recommend an alternative. The agency replied: ""You can meet someone in real life."" On Tuesday, it said its earlier tweet was ""still relevant"". However, open rights campaigners have warned that local bans can be defeated.

The law was approved by Russia's upper house of parliament in April. It includes measures to ensure that bloggers cannot remain anonymous, and states that social networks must maintain six months of data on its users. The information must be stored on servers based in Russian territory, so that government authorities can gain access. Critics see it as the latest in a series of recent moves to curb internet freedom. Hugh Williamson, of New York-based Human Rights Watch, has called the law ""another milestone in Russia's relentless crackdown on free expression"". ""The internet is the last island of free expression in Russia and these draconian regulations are clearly aimed at putting it under government control,"" he added.

Analysis: Famil Ismailov, news editor, BBCRussian.com Russian bloggers are bracing themselves for the moment when Russia's new ""information security law"" comes into force on 1 August. Some already share advice on how to use proxy servers in order to access social media sites that, in their view, are under threat of being closed. It is hard to see how the law will be enforced. The servers for most of the popular social media platforms that many Russians use are based outside Russia. Many popular bloggers are already looking for, and apparently finding, ways to ""cheat"" the feature that counts page visits and keep their daily unique visitor numbers just under 3000, or to make sure that the statistics are hidden altogether. Anton Nossik, who is considered Russia's ""internet guru"", wrote in his LiveJournal blog that the new law didn't threaten individual bloggers directly, but provided legal grounds to block popular social networks like Facebook, Twitter, LiveJournal and Google. ""The issue of banning all these platforms in Russia is a political one and it will be decided by only one person"", Mr Nossik wrote, with a thinly veiled reference to President Vladimir Putin. Earlier in the year, Russia enacted a law that gave the government powers to block websites without explanation. In March, Moscow blocked the blog of Mr Navalny, along with two news sites and a organisation run by Garry Kasparov - a vocal critic of the Russian government. In a statement, Russia's prosecutor general's office said the blocks were imposed because of the sites' role in helping stage illegal protests. Earlier this week, Twitter blocked access to an anti-Kremlin account that often publishes leaked government documents, following a request by Russia's federal communications agency Roskomnadzor.

Liam Craig sealed the win from the penalty spot with two minutes to play, before Graham Cummins finished a sumptuous stoppage-time move. And things got worse still for Caley Thistle after the match, with captain Gary Warren shown a red card in the tunnel. Saints remain five points clear of Hearts in fourth place, and closed the gap on third-placed Rangers, who play Aberdeen on Sunday, to three points. With game after game ticking past, Inverness' position looks increasingly perilous. Next weekend's trip to Motherwell, second-bottom on goal difference, is now seismic. This contest turned nightmarish for the hosts after a bright opening, but the truth is, given their predicament, Caley Thistle did not threaten St Johnstone's goal enough. Billy Mckay sent a shot over from close range. Alex Fisher nodded a diving header wide. Carl Tremarco miscued a volley. Greg Tansey did draw a save from Alan Mannus when he rasped in an effort from outside the box, but Richie Foran's side never looked likely to find the net. Their best opportunity came immediately after the Saints went ahead, when Tansey fed Cole, who seemed to panic in a terrific position and shot straight at Mannus. Cole's dismissal ended the contest when he appeared to be cautioned twice for challenging referee Stephen Finnie's decision not to award a foul. St Johnstone were merciless and could have had more. With just one win from their last 21 league games, Inverness look deep in trouble. Tommy Wright's side deserve so much credit. Saints were tactically brilliant, so strong defensively and ruthlessly capitalised on their man advantage. They took one of their few first-half chances when Michael Coulson broke down the left and sent a dangerous ball across the six-yard box. Owain Fon Williams could only parry into the danger area, Cummins' shot was blocked but Maclean followed up to force it home. They should have had another when Craig's superb curling corner flew all the way to the back post where Cummins slid in and somehow knocked it over from two yards. Craig, in his 300th appearance for the club, coolly converted a spot-kick after Cummins was tripped to seal the points. Cummins then slammed home after Miller danced around the area to tee him up, before Craig cracked the bar amid the late flurry. With a tendency to finish the season strongly, and just a three-point gap to Rangers, the Perth side look capable of something special this term. Inverness CT manager Richie Foran: ""It is a tough time of the season to be sitting bottom, and I need real men to stand up to that, but not enough of them did that today. ""It is pure luck we are still in it and it is only four points. I sound like a broken record but one win changes it - that is the truth. But I need braver players with more passion and desire.",0,4,2
openai_davinci,"Stone Age people used a hollow tree stump as a home in a Stonehenge landscape, archaeologists have found.","The shelter - in a hollow left behind by a fallen tree - at Blick Mead was used over a 90-year period from 4336 BC, it is believed. Archaeologist David Jacques, said: ""They... used the stump of the tree, about three metres high, as a wall."" The finds are being shown to United Nations heritage experts, who are currently visiting Stonehenge. Archaeologists are concerned a planned 2.9km tunnel being considered for the nearby A303 main road will damage the site. Discoveries have also shown stones were warmed up by the Mesolithic Period inhabitants and used in a hearth to emit heat in the earthy snug. Mr Jacques, a senior research fellow at the University of Buckingham, has worked at Blick Mead for over a decade, making a number of discoveries about the inhabitants. The tree stump created a wall height similar to a ""modern bungalow"". ""They've draped probably animal skins or thatch around the basin and connected it to a post so it's a very comfortable snug little place,"" he said. The wooden wall of the hollow was lined with flints and the large earthy pit created by the tree root lined with cobbles and decorated with ""exotic"" stones from outside the area. ""There are some clever and sophisticated things going on, the hot stones that they put into this little type of alcove wouldn't have been on fire,"" explained Mr Jacques. ""It looks more like these people have been using these hot stones as a type of storage heater so that you've got a lot of warmth coming off them."" Mr Jacques will meet the UN experts later to ask for the route to be moved closer to Salisbury and for hydrological assessments to be made. ""It's very likely the water flow would be reduced in and around the site,"" he said. ""It would take out all the organics and destroy all the animal bone we've been finding which is crucial for finding where they have been living and for getting radiocarbon dates from all the organics like pollen and wood. ""This is massively important for reconstructing what the landscape would have looked like."" Andy Rhind-Tutt, former mayor and chairman of Amesbury Museum and Heritage Trust said: ""I sincerely hope the team delivering the long-awaited A303 improvement look seriously at an alternative alignment south of Salisbury and away from this unequalled archaeological landscape. ""It would be criminal to destroy such a rich heritage and connection with our ancestors for the sake of blocking the view to the passing public of Stonehenge.""",1,5,5
openai_davinci,Surrey batsman Mark Stoneman has been named the County Championship player of the month for April.,"The stand-in captain faced 535 balls across two innings, moving from 174 not out overnight to end 219 not out in Surrey's first-innings score of 483. Following on, he then made 68 in Surrey's 166-3 to keep Hampshire at bay and prompt handshakes at 16:50 BST. The draw sees third-placed Hampshire claim 12 points, while Surrey take 10 points and stay sixth in Division One. Burns' epic effort saw him stay in the field for all but 10 overs of the entire match, as he defied Hampshire's bowling efforts on a flat Oval pitch. The left-hander was dropped twice in the slip cordon in his career-best 219, but was the only one to resist as Ian Holland (3-37) dismissed Tom Curran (53), Amar Virdi and Mark Footitt to force the follow-on after Surrey began the day on 410-7. Mark Stoneman (47) and Burns then put on an opening stand of 109 before Holland's medium pace had Stoneman lbw and Scott Borthwick bowled in a single over. Sean Ervine became the only man to dismiss Burns in 756 minutes of play when he missed a ball down the leg side, but Jason Roy and Dominic Sibley continued on until the conclusion. Surrey captain Rory Burns told BBC Radio London: ""I'm really pleased that we've fought that hard to get the draw and the extra five points, and obviously pretty happy with how I've played. ""We had to bat seven sessions to get us to safety and that's all I was thinking. ""There were some jitters in the nineties and I got a lifeline, which was quite nice. When I was getting close to 200, I was more thinking about the situation of getting to the follow-on mark. ""They're a good side and they played really well. We managed to hold on and get ourselves to safety, so it was honours even on a flat wicket.""",0,4,4

The council said it would bring staff in line with the other 17,000 workers and ""reduce the risk"" of staff making claims for equal pay. Union Unison said it was ""bitterly disappointed"" with the decision. Regional officer, Helen Metcalf, said: ""This is a devastating blow for the 2,700 teaching assistants in the county, who now face being driven into poverty and relying on food banks through losing Â£200 - Â£400 per month of their salary."" She said there was ""no option"" but to lodge a formal dispute and ballot members for industrial action. Teaching assistant Tony Lowery, said: ""It is really devastating for my family because I'm the main wager. I don't mean things like going on holidays or a second car, I mean things like food on the table and clothes on our backs."" Liberal Democrat councillors voted unanimously against the plans. Councillor Owen Temple said the affected staff would ""find themselves the poorest teaching assistants in the North East"" and the council was ""very likely to face legal challenge"". The council's corporate director of resources, Don McLure, said there was a ""real risk"" that, under the present contracts, other council employees could make claims for equal pay with the teaching assistants. He said: ""I fully understand the position teaching assistants are in but they are very valued, they do a great job and support the education of our children, but we are doing this to bring them in line with the rest of our workforce."" He said two consultations with assistants and the unions had failed to find agreement but it was hoped further discussions would resolve the matter without strike action being taken.",0,4,3

At the party's weekly press briefing, I asked the Welsh Conservative leader Andrew RT Davies, who was elected on the list, whether he'd stand as a constituency candidate in his home turf of the Vale of Glamorgan but he said he hadn't thought about it. Presumably those are the kind of decisions they will now feel more confident contemplating. The party will also have a huge amount of new data on voters which it'll be able to call upon and the belief that campaigning hard on the NHS helped the Tories cross the line in places like the Vale of Clwyd and Gower. The Conservatives feel it's them, rather than any of the other opposition parties, who have become the repository of votes from those who are disaffected by the state of the NHS. Welsh Labour are going to hold a ""short sharp"" analysis into what went wrong. Carwyn Jones was in line with most of the criticism of Ed Miliband when he told AMs that the party needed to appeal to small business owners who are not millionaires but who work hard. What will be more difficult is countering the argument on the NHS, which the former minister Alun Davies believes is already lost. Another potential difficulty for Welsh Labour will be dealing with unhappiness within the party over council re-organisation. Bernie Attridge, the deputy leader of Flintshire Council, has tweeted saying the party needs to be careful on local government reform if it wants to retain the support of grassroots councillors. It also seems to have been the case that Labour lost more votes to UKIP than the Conservatives, which is another challenge to overcome. But Labour will at least have the advantage that it will be David Cameron, and not Ed Miliband, carrying out the latest round of public sector cuts that are likely to take effect sooner rather than later. The question is whether Carwyn Jones is going to be able to turn that to his advantage when his own record in government will be under scrutiny. Plaid Cymru's education spokesman, Simon Thomas, also in the party's weekly press briefing, said he believed Leanne Wood could portray herself as an alternative first minister because of the way she emotionally connected with people in the campaign. The party now has a year to make that a credible proposition after it failed to gain any new seats and came fourth, behind UKIP, in the overall share of the vote, despite her unprecedented profile. He also said that on the campaign trail people wanted to know what Plaid was going to do about the NHS and that people ""did not see the strengths"" of its arguments. The Welsh Liberal Democrats are still licking their wounds but in a ""je ne regrette rien"" moment, the leader Kirsty Williams said she had no regrets over the coalition. She has admitted the party failed to communicate",1,3,5
openai_davinci,The Scottish government will update MSPs on its plans for a controversial children's database after a legal challenge to the scheme.,"John Swinney will address MSPs over a legal challenge to information sharing proposals within the Act. The system would appoint a named person - usually a teacher or health visitor - to ensure the wellbeing of every child. But judges at the UK's highest court ruled against the scheme in July 2016, citing concerns over information sharing. The Supreme Court judges said some proposals breached rights to privacy and a family life under the European Convention on Human Rights. However, the court said the aim of the Act, which is intended to promote and safeguard the rights and wellbeing of children and young people, was legitimate. Speaking ahead of his statement to the Scottish Parliament, Mr Swinney said the Scottish government remained ""absolutely committed"" to the Named Person service as a way to support children and their families. ""Last year the Supreme Court ruled definitively that the intention of providing a Named Person for every child to promote and safeguard their wellbeing was 'unquestionably legitimate and benign',"" he said. ""Their judgement did, however, require us to change the provisions relating to information sharing. ""Since the judgement, we have undertaken an intensive period of engagement with children, young people, parents, carers, practitioners and professionals. ""I will now update parliament on the next steps in this vital means of supporting, safeguarding and promoting the wellbeing of our children and young people."" The judges said in July that specific proposals about information-sharing were ""not within the legislative competence of the Scottish Parliament"". And they said the legislation made it ""perfectly possible"" that confidential information about a young person could be disclosed to a ""wide range of public authorities without either the child or young person or her parents being aware"". The appeal was brought by the No to Named Persons (NO2NP) coalition, which includes the Christian Institute, Care (Christian Action Research and Education), Tyme Trust and the Family Education Trust. The Scottish government has said previously it would not commence the legislation until the problems were fixed.",1,5,4

""We were [rehearsing] in the tent for about a week and a half, then we had to move to bigger studios in Hollywood where we are working on the rest of the show,"" she told Houston radio station Mix 96.5. ""And then we will send that equipment to Houston where we will finish rehearsals. Fans can expect a performance that spans my career so far."" She has a high standard to live up to - notably Prince's show in 2007, which took place in the middle of a Miami thunderstorm and is widely accepted as the greatest performance in the event's history, if not Prince's career. Here are some of the other most memorable - and surprising - moments from the last 30 years. Super Bowl performers get a very strict 12-minute time limit, so most performers cram their set with as much music as possible. Not Michael Jackson. After shooting onto the stage at the Pasadena Rose Bowl, he stood completely still, staring at the world for a full 90 seconds. Ninety. It was a master class in ratcheting expectation to a fever pitch. And the screams when he launched into Jam (not one of his best songs) proved he knew what he was doing. Brilliantly, Jackson staged this entire performance while wearing a jacket it looked like he'd borrowed from Muammar Gaddafi. Beat that, Gaga. Baby, he was born to run... and slide on his knees... and crotch slam a TV camera. In his autobiography, The Boss explains the incident like this: ""Too much adrenalin, a late drop, too much speed, here I come, Mikeâ€¦ BOOM! ""And I'm onto his camera, the lens implanted into my chest with one leg off the stage. I use his camera to push myself back up andâ€¦ BLAM! BORN TO RUN!"" It led to the memorable headline: ""America Attacked by Bruce Springsteen's crotch"" - but it didn't stop the star delivering one of the most powerful and energetic Super Bowl shows in recent history. Even if they were fined for over-running by 40 seconds. Coldplay were the headline act at last year's Super Bowl in Santa Clara - but someone forgot to tell Beyonce. She only performed one song, Formation, underscoring its message of black pride and power with back-up dancers dressed in leather body suits and black berets reminiscent of the Black Panthers movement. Some of her dancers were even pictured holding up a sign declaring ""Justice 4 Mario Woods"" - a 26-year-old black man who was shot dead by armed police in San Francisco two months earlier. The performance heralded the arrival of her unapologetically political album, Lemonade, later in the year. You can't out-diva Diana, something she was determined to prove when she strode onto the pitch in Tempe, Arizona, for Super Bowl XXX.

Their intention in travelling to the region, where areas are controlled by Islamic State (IS) militants or an al-Qaeda affiliate, is not clear. The Foreign Office has said it is in contact with the Turkish authorities. The BBC's Mark Lowen said the information about the ages of the children had not been independently verified and it was too early to know where the group were intending to head to. ""Were they heading for one of the more moderate groups in Syria. Were they heading for the area controlled by al-Nusra, the al-Qaeda affiliate? Or were they heading to so-called Islamic State territory?"" he said. The group was taken to a police station in southern Turkey overnight, and then sent to the foreigners department awaiting deportation to the UK. They have undergone medical examinations and had their finger-prints taken. The United Nations estimates the number of foreign fighters joining militant groups is more than 25,000, from 100 different nations. About 600 Britons are believed to have gone to Syria or Iraq since IS seized control of large swathes of territory there. Most are thought to have volunteered as fighters for the militant Islamist group. Around half are believed to have later returned to the UK, the Metropolitan Police has said. The latest detentions come two weeks after three British teenagers were stopped from travelling into Syria from Turkey. The three - two aged 17 and one 19, from north-west London - were arrested following a tip-off from British police and flown back to the UK. They have since been released on police bail. They had flown to Turkey from Barcelona and were arrested at Sabiha Gokcen airport in Istanbul. Fadi Hakura, Turkey analyst for Chatham House, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the recent arrests showed the Turkish government was ""taking more effective measures to control the flow of fighters and supporters into Syria"". He said there was now ""more enhanced security and intelligence cooperation between Turkey and its Western counterparts, especially with the exchange of names that Turkey needs to prohibit [IS supporters] from crossing into Syria"". The Turkish government has said it cannot make a 560-mile border watertight and will act when it has prior warning. In February this year there were recriminations between British police and Turkish officials after three London schoolgirls disappeared from Turkey, apparently having crossed the border into Syria. Shamima Begum, Amira Abase, both 15, and Kadiza Sultana, 16 had flown to Istanbul and travelled to the border region.

A reading below 50 indicates falling output. It is the first time that activity in the sector has fallen since March 2013. Firms blamed soft domestic demand, a fall in new business from overseas and uncertainty ahead of the EU referendum. A slowdown in the oil and gas industry, a major customer for UK companies, is also hitting production. The index for new orders fell to 50.4 in April, from 51.9 the month before, matching February's three-year low. Rob Dobson, senior economist at Markit, said: ""On this evidence manufacturing production is now falling at a quarterly pace of around 1%, and will likely act as a drag on the economy again during the second quarter and putting greater pressure on the service sector to sustain GDP growth. ""The manufacturing labour market is also being impacted, with the data signalling close to 20,000 job losses over the past three months."" Last week, official figures showed UK economic growth slowed to 0.4% in the first quarter of the year from 0.6% in late 2015, propped up by the services sector. David Noble, group chief executive at the Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply (CIPS), said: ""Recent fears over a stall in the UK's manufacturing sector have now become a reality. ""An atmosphere of deep unease is building throughout the manufacturing supply chain, eating away at new orders, reducing British exports and putting more jobs at risk. ""A sense of apprehension across the sector is being caused by enduring volatility in the oil and gas industry, falling retailer confidence and the uncertainty created by the EU referendum."" The Markit/CIPS survey found new export orders contracted for the fourth straight month in April as the global economy continued to slow. A measure of employment in the manufacturing sector was also below the 50 mark for its fourth straight month. Lee Hopley, chief economist at the manufacturers' organisation, EEF, said: ""The sharp drop to a three-year low and another month of reported job cuts could be the clearest sign yet that referendum uncertainty is starting to weigh on the real economy. ""However, this is just another straw on the back of a sector already grappling with the struggling oil and gas sector, softening domestic demand and weak order outlook from other parts of the world, all of which are failing to provide any counterbalance to the political uncertainty at home.""",1,4,4

""The battle against corruption will not be won overnight. It will take time, courage and determination to deliver the reforms that are necessary. But we cannot hope to solve the major global challenges we face without tackling the exploitation, fraud and dishonesty at their heart. ""For too long there has been a taboo about tackling this issue head-on. The summit will change that. Together we will push the fight against corruption to the top of the international agenda where it belongs."" Among the world leaders attending the summit are presidents Ashraf Ghani of Afghanistan, Juan Manuel Santos of Colombia and Muhammadu Buhari of Nigeria, and Norwegian prime minister Erna Solberg. Russia is to be represented by deputy foreign minister Oleg Syromolotov. Panellists are expected to include World Bank president Jim Yong Kim and International Monetary Fund's managing director Christine Lagarde. Under the prime minister's plans, leaders at the summit would pledge to expose corruption and pursue and punish those who perpetrate, facilitate or are complicit in it. Campaigners have also called for a crackdown on tax havens linked to the United Kingdom. The recent Panama Papers leak showed how some wealthy people use offshore firms to evade tax and avoid sanctions. A Downing Street spokesman said: ""We are in discussions with the Overseas Territories and Crown dependencies with major financial centres about their attendance, and expect a number to join the summit."" Robert Barrington, of anti-corruption campaigners Transparency International, said: ""The prime minister is creating a platform for governments that are serious about fighting corruption to make really significant changes and set the agenda for a generation to come.

openai_davinci,The US Supreme Court has ruled that subsidies for millions of low-income Americans to help them pay for their health insurance are legal.,"In a 6-3 decision, the justices said that tax subsidies that make health insurance affordable for low-income individuals can continue. The ruling preserves the law known as Obamacare, which Mr Obama considers a major part of his presidential legacy. Republicans have vowed to continue fighting the law. ""We've got more work to do, but what we're not going to do is unravel what has now been woven into the fabric of America,"" Mr Obama said. The case, known as King v Burwell, was the second major challenge the law has faced in the US's highest court. Unlike in many other western countries, the US does not have a single-payer healthcare system. Private companies, rather than the US government, provide health insurance for US citizens. The enactment of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) - one of Mr Obama's most significant and controversial domestic achievements - in 2010 mandated that every American had to purchase private insurance. It provided the subsidies to allow many to do so. In 2012, the mandate portion of the law was challenged in the court. The justices ruled to preserve it. In that decision, as in the decision on Thursday, Chief Justice John Roberts surprised observers by siding with his liberal colleagues in support of the law. ""Congress passed the Affordable Care act to improve health insurance markets, not to destroy them,"" Chief Justice John Roberts wrote in the opinion. Justice Anthony Kennedy dissented in 2012, but sided with the majority on Thursday. Had the court made the opposite decision, an estimated 8.7 million people in the US would have been at risk of losing the aid that makes healthcare affordable. The stakes could not have been higher. People's health (crucially important) and Obama's legacy (less important, but for him and those around him fairly vital) were at stake. Well a politically finely balanced Supreme Court has given an emphatic, overwhelming vote in favour of the president by 6-3. I bet ""No-drama Obama"" is high-fiving anyone and everyone in the White House - that is how big it is. Obama defies lame-duck expectations Demonstrators gathered outside the court as early on Thursday morning. Reading updates on their mobile phones, the crowd became jubilant when they learned mid-morning that the court had ruled in their favour. Some began dancing, while others chanted ""If you're covered and you know it clap your hands."" ""This is a big sigh of relief for millions across the country,"" said Ron Pollack of Families USA, a health-care advocacy organisation. ""The ACA is not just the law of the land, it will remain the law of the land"". ""Today is a good day for healthcare in America,"" said activist Benton Strong. ""I hope this is the end of the line."" Demonstrators opposing the subsidies did not have a large visible presence. Justice Antonin Scalia wrote in his dissent that the Supreme Court is setting a precedent of favouring some laws over others. ""We should start calling this law Scotuscare"" Justice Scalia wrote, referring to the court's acronym. ""Today's interpretation is not merely unnatural; it is unheard",1,5,4

He said he would now look at the 125 existing marine protected areas to see if further improvements could be made. The Marine Conservation Society (MCS) described it as an ""embarrassing U-turn"" for the Welsh government, and has called for better protection of seas. Creating the zones would mean a ban on fishing and anchoring in some areas and had brought opposition. The Welsh Fishermen's Association said previously that existing conservation networks for Welsh waters are adequate. The Welsh government proposed the zones last year with the backing of the Countryside Council of Wales and the Marine Conservation Society. The minister for natural resources said the decision had been made after the thousands of responses to the consultation brought ""divergent and strongly held views"". Mr Davies said to ""avoid any continuing uncertainty over the options presented in the 2012 consultation, I am also withdrawing all the proposed sites"". His comments come after the findings were published of a task and finish team which reviewed the feedback. Now, he will concentrate on the existing 125 Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) that cover 36% of Welsh seas to see if any changes can be made rather than creating additional zones. ""We are now in a stronger position to assess our current contribution to the network's ecological coherence,"" he said. ""I have, therefore, commissioned an assessment of our current MPAs to identify if there are any gaps and what the options might be to fill those gaps. ""If any measures are required, I believe they should be simple, proportionate and fit for purpose."" Dr Peter Richardson, biodiversity programme manager for MCS, said the Welsh government ""spent an awful lot of time and money and encouraged other people to put effort into this consultation response"".

She will take on a new role on the clinic's Northern Ireland advisory board. Last November, anti-abortion protester Bernadette Smyth, who leads the Precious Life group, was convicted of harassing Ms Purvis at the Marie Stopes office in Belfast city centre. Ms Purvis told the BBC that had had no influence on her decision to step down. ""I think the clinic's well established here now, we're providing services more and more every year and I'm delighted to be remaining on the advisory board for the clinic. ""But I feel it's time to move on and I think it's time for Marie Stopes to get someone else in to manage the clinic and take it to new places,"" she said. ""At times it was difficult, particularly last year with the court case and the harassment, but I put that behind me and have concentrated on delivering services for women in Ireland both north and south. ""I think I've achieved a significant historical change in the perception of abortion in Northern Ireland from where the usual narrative was that abortion was illegal in Northern Ireland to now one where people understand that abortion is legal under certain circumstances. ""I think we've challenged the myths and stereotypes that are presented by those who are opposed to a woman's right to chose."" Genevieve Edwards, director of policy for Marie Stopes UK, said: ""We were so lucky to have Dawn and wish her every success in whatever she chooses to do. ""The support for the clinic since it opened in very challenging circumstances has been heartening and a source of great comfort and pride for our staff and volunteers. ""We are now actively recruiting for Dawn's successor to lead us into the next phase of the clinic's journey.""",0,5,4
openai_davinci,The disappearance of gibbons from documents in China has revealed the animals were once widespread across half of the country.,"Today, China has between 26 and 28 Hainan gibbons left, but government records that date back to the 17th Century show that gibbons were once widespread across half of the country. The apes began to disappear from the documents about 150 years ago, corresponding with population growth. The study is published in the Proceedings of the Royal Society B. Hainan gibbons are now limited to a few isolated patches of forest in the south west of China. They live in just four social groups, one of which was only discovered a few weeks ago. Understanding this population crash has been difficult, but the old government documents have helped to reveal when and how the numbers fell. Dr Sam Turvey, from the Zoological Society of London, said: ""China is one of the few places in the world that has a very very rich, long historical record. ""Because it has had such a complex bureaucracy for so long, there has been a lot of need for reporting - not just numbers of households for tax purposes and things like that, but also in terms of the kinds of natural resources that were available in the immediate environment."" These included records of animals, including gibbons, he said. ""We looked at the pattern of disappearance of gibbons through time and how that varied from place to place and the different environmental conditions and human pressures that were also present in these places."" The archives show that gibbons were a common sight in about 20 provinces in China well into the 17th and 18th Century. However, Dr Turvey said it was ""a stark contrast to their very imperilled position today"". ""We see a really steep increase in population decline and real population collapse across China about 100-150 years ago,"" he added. ""And this correlates with demographic expansion in China towards the end of the Imperial era and through the 20th Century, and the massive increase in deforestation and human population growth through the time of the Chinese Republic and the establishment of the communist party."" The researchers said a better understanding of the animals' decline would help them to establish a conservation plan for the country's last few Hainan gibbons. Dr Turvey said: ""It is an incredible privilege to be able to see gibbons in China in the wild. ""The Hainan gibbon is such as rare species, but knowing that this species is still hanging on there gives you hope that conservation will be able to bring that population back from the brink.""

openai_davinci,The election commission has urged Kenyans to be patient as it announced it was delaying the announcement of the final results of the presidential election.,"Returning officers were ordered to physically deliver paper copies of their constituency's tallies to the counting centre in the capital. Election officials have urged patience. Uhuru Kenyatta, who faces trial at the International Criminal Court, has been leading in early presidential results declared from Monday's tightly contested election. He is due to stand trial at The Hague next month for allegedly fuelling violence after the disputed 2007 election. He denies the charge. His closest rival is outgoing Prime Minister Raila Odinga. With provisional results in from more than 40% of polling stations earlier on Wednesday, Mr Odinga had 42% of the vote compared with Mr Kenyatta's 53%. However, Mr Odinga's allies remain confident that he will gain ground as results from his strongholds, including the Coast Province, are declared. More than 1,000 people were killed in the violence which broke out in 2007-08 after Mr Odinga claimed he had been cheated of victory by supporters of President Mwai Kibaki, who is stepping down after two terms in office. The BBC's Solomon Mugera in the capital, Nairobi, says Kenyans are becoming increasingly anxious about the delay in finalising the results. Some businesses and schools across the country have remained shut since Monday's election, he says. This has led to a shortage of goods, pushing up the prices of basic foodstuff in areas such as Kibera, the biggest slum in Nairobi and a stronghold of Mr Odinga, our correspondent adds. Uhuru Kenyatta Raila Odinga Profile: Uhuru Kenyatta Profile: Raila Odinga Some electoral officials have had to drive hundreds of kilometres to the counting centre in Nairobi to deliver paper copies of the tally of their returns. At about 13:00 local time, returning officers from only 53 of the 290 constituencies had arrived and the election commission said it would announce results from constituencies as they were ready. Its website had stopped giving updated results from the presidential race on Wednesday, and was still showing figures from Tuesday night. Our correspondent says the large number of spoiled ballots - about 6% of the total vote, well over double the number of votes cast for the third-placed candidate, Musailia Mudavadi - has become a major bone of contention. Mr Odinga's Coalition of Reforms and Democracy (Cord) wants them to be counted, but Mr Kenyatta's Jubilee Coalition is resisting this. Late on Tuesday, the election commission announced that the spoiled ballots would count in the overall vote total, increasing the likelihood of a run-off between the top two candidates, news agencies report. Mr Kenyatta's running mate William Ruto, who is also facing a trial at the ICC, said foreign embassies may have influenced such a decision. ""We want to believe that this is not an attempt to deny the Jubilee Coalition a first-round victory as is clearly now on the wall,"" he is quoted by Reuters news agency as saying. But the election commission now says a decision on what to do about the spoiled ballots will be taken after all other votes are counted, our correspondent reports.

openai_davinci,The future of BHS is still unclear after the latest bid to rescue it from collapse.,"BHS entered administration in April. Since then, efforts have been continuing to rescue it from closure and save the jobs of its 11,000 staff. Last week, a surprise late bid led by retail veteran Greg Tufnell transformed the race to acquire the retailer. His team, said to be backed by Portuguese money, is the front-runner. But if a deal cannot be struck, the business may still have to be liquidated. The remaining bidders have faded into the background. Another consortium led by Matalan tycoon John Hargreaves and Turkish retail entrepreneur Cafer Mahiroglu has reportedly run into difficulties, while other suitors have apparently failed to impress with their proposals. Some of those involved in the different bids have impressive retailing histories. But then Sir Philip Green, who controlled BHS from 2000 to 2015, also had a brilliant track record. And he ended up selling the business for Â£1. So what are the chances of saving BHS from the liquidators? And just who are the people aiming to do it? In the public eye, Greg Tufnell is easily overshadowed by his more famous brother Phil, the former England cricketer. But that could change if his bid for BHS is successful, because he hopes to become the firm's next chairman. And as far as his credentials for the job are concerned, the 54-year-old executive certainly talks the talk. He describes himself as ""a highly experienced managing director with Mothercare and Arcadia, a blend of entrepreneur, strategist and hands-on operator with significant commercial business turnaround, acquisition and fund-raising experience"". His record shows that he was buying and merchandising director at Next from 1991 to 1994. He then spent three years as managing director of menswear retailer Burton, part of the Arcadia group, followed by another three years as managing director of Mothercare. He currently appears to occupy a portfolio of different jobs, including the chairmanships of leather accessories brand Zatchels and recruitment consultancy hga Group. Earlier this month, he registered a new firm, Richess Group, at Companies House. Its other directors are Nick de Scossa, a Swiss banker, and Lisbon-based entrepreneur Jose Maria Soares Bento. Until Mr Tufnell's bid turned up, many observers had assumed that BHS would be snapped up by Matalan founder Mr Hargreaves. But it appears that the cost of a deal may have proved too high. Sources say Mr Hargreaves was asked to improve his offer and balked. Like Sir Philip Green, 71-year-old John Hargreaves also enjoys the life of the super-rich. He has an estimated fortune of Â£1bn, according to the Sunday Times Rich List. But in stark contrast to the ebullient Sir Philip, Mr Hargreaves is described by industry insiders as quiet-spoken, someone who shuns the limelight. Mr Hargreaves is no longer directly involved in the business he founded. He sold his 69% stake in Matalan in 2000, then in 2006 took it private through Missouri Bidco, a company 53.5% owned by him and his family. As a partner in Mr Hargreaves' bid, there is also Cafer Mahiroglu, the owner of Select Fashions. At 50, he is the youngest of",1,5,4
openai_davinci,"The government has been urged to protect social care services for the elderly, amid warnings that councils face a £1.1bn funding shortfall this year.","Councils in England are facing a £1.1bn shortfall this year, on top of ""almost unendurable"" cuts since 2010, the Association of Directors of Adult Social Services has warned. Freezing care provider fees to save money was no long sustainable, it said. Ministers say extra money will help NHS and social care services work together. The survey, which was completed by 147 directors of adult social services for councils in England, suggests that funding reductions to social care budgets have totalled £4.6bn since 2010 - a 31% overall reduction. Budgets for adult social care - which provides practical support to people due to illness, disability, old age or a low income - will reduce by a further £500m in cash terms this year, it said. ""Taking the growth in numbers of older and disabled people into account, this means that an additional £1.1bn would be needed to provide the same level of service as last year,"" the report warned. It said some councils had made savings in the past by freezing fees paid to providers, but care providers were now also facing financial problems. Some companies - particularly those in southern England - are struggling to attract staff, amid increasing concern about the quality of care, it said. ""What is at stake is the continuing capacity of adult social care to sustain services to those in greatest need,"" ADASS president Ray James said. ""In virtually all our authorities, the number in need is growing, while the complexity of their needs is increasing."" ADASS called for the government to ""protect essential care and support services to the most vulnerable members of our community"". But a government spokesman said the survey ""ignores"" a commitment to invest £10bn in health services that are being ""joined up"" with social care, by 2020. The BBC has launched an online guide to the care system for the over-65s. The ""care calculator"" covers residential care and the support provided in people's own homes, for tasks such as washing and dressing. Users can submit their postcode and find out how much each service costs where they live in the UK. There is also a dedicated BBC Cost of Care website, with news stories, analysis and video. The spokesman said: ""Increasing budgets isn't the only solution. By working innovatively and joining up health and social care we can improve care and also save money."" However, Councillor Izzi Seccombe, from the Local Government Association (LGA), said adult social care services were facing ""enormous pressures"" due to ""insufficient funding, growing demand and escalating costs"". ""We have long warned that investing in the NHS whilst social care budgets are under continual pressure is simply a false economy. ""It is social care services that support elderly and vulnerable people to maintain their independence, live in their own community and stay out of hospital longer,"" she added. Caroline Abrahams, charity director at Age UK, said the idea of a further £1bn coming out of social care budgets was ""chilling"".

The couple spoke out in response to consultation on proposed reform of sentencing for driving offences. They believe increased sentences should be backed up by manslaughter charges. Mr Moores, 28, was killed by a Vauxhall Astra driven by Donna Hackett on the M4 near Swindon. Hackett, then aged 26, fled and was found by police asleep in a ditch. She served half of a six-year jail term after she was found guilty of causing death by careless driving while drunk. The Ministry of Justice consultation suggests offenders who cause death by careless driving while under the influence of drink or drugs could soon be handed a life sentence - an increase on the current 14-year upper limit. Source: Crown Prosecution Service But Mr and Mrs Moores, from Chandlers Ford, Hampshire, also want the offence to be upgraded to a charge of manslaughter. Mr Moores said: ""Somebody can drive drunk and kill my son. Why is that not manslaughter? ""Nothing can prepare a parent for seeing their child in the mortuary. That will stay with me every day, every day that vision comes into my mind. ""Our life is ruined."" Mrs Moores added: ""There's nothing careless about drink driving. I don't want anybody else to feel like us."" Ms Hackett, who lived in Radnor Street, Swindon, at the time of the offence, appealed against her sentence in September 2011, but was refused. A Ministry of Justice spokesperson said: ""We are determined to make sure those who kill whilst driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs face the full force of the law. ""That is why we are consulting on plans that will see the maximum sentence for a number of offences in this area increase from 14 years to life.""

openai_davinci,"The popularity of mead, a honey-based alcoholic drink, is growing in the US.","But what's brewing in this new crop of commercial meaderies - as they are known - is lot more refined from the drink that once decorated tables across medieval Europe. ""Do we have any mead makers or home brewers in the group?"" asks Ben Alexander, eying a crowd of a dozen or so people who have come to his Maine Meade Works, in Portland, on a rainy Friday for a tour. When no-one raises their hand, Mr Alexander launches into the full spiel. ""If you guys want to come around, I'll show you how this thing works,"" he says, gesturing to two ceiling-high columns of stainless steel filled with something resembling a mushy golden porridge. ""We mix up honey and water over there and we pump it through a hot water bath at 160 degrees [71C] in a stainless steel coil here. Each one produces about 50 to 75 gallons [227-340 litres] of mead a day,"" explains Mr Alexander. It's fair to say he is obsessed with mead. ""It's the quintessential local beverage - you can go anywhere in the world and find honey to make mead, and I think that's unique among alcoholic beverages,"" he gushes. After being introduced to the drink by a home brewer, Mr Alexander thought there were profits to be had in a commercial meadery. He founded Maine Mead Works in 2008, pouring his savings and money from friends and family into the business. His business has since grown, along with the popularity of mead in the US. It's now a seven-person operation that manufactures more than 7,500 cases a year, shipping them as far away as China. Mr Alexander is not the only one to have caught on to the commercial potential of mead. Vicky Rowe, the owner of mead information website GotMead, says interest in the product in the US has exploded in the past decade. ""We went from 30-40 meaderies making mead to somewhere in the vicinity of 250 in the last 10 years,"" she says. ""I like to say that everything old is new again - people come back to what was good once."" Even visitors to Mr Alexander's meadery agree. Tour participant Dirk Heseman admitted that while Maine Mead Works was the first meadery he'd actually visited, he has noticed that mead ""is becoming more and more available - similar to cider"". Just this year, commercial meaderies in the US have banded together to form an industry group, the American Mead Makers Association, to better share information and encourage growth in the industry. But there's a lot of work that needs to be done to improve the image of a drink long associated with Renaissance fairs and medieval re-enactments. ""I think our number one challenge as an industry is awareness of what mead is,"" says Mr Alexander. ""You ask 10 people in a room if they've ever heard of mead, and two of them might say, 'yes', and only one of them has had a very positive experience."" The mead of the past was often sweet, and didn't appeal to many drinkers",1,5,5

Wrockwardine Wood and Sutherland academies, also run by the Telford Co-operative Multi-Academy Trust, were put in special measures earlier this week. The trust has not commented. Ofsted criticised the trust's lack of support to the schools and said each was now considering an alternative sponsor. Inspectors said pupils' achievement at the Phoenix Academy had dropped since it became an academy in 2013 and their latest report rated it inadequate in all areas. A report in 2013, before it converted, rated the secondary school as ""requiring improvement"", while Lakeside was rated ""good"" in 2012 under its former name the Lord Silkin School. In the latest report, inspectors said the curriculum at Phoenix Academy was ""inadequate"", while ""weak teaching"" meant pupils were not sufficiently challenged and were often ""disengaged and disruptive"". There was particular criticism of standards in English and maths which the watchdog said were limiting pupils' achievements in other areas. Ofsted's report said governors, managers and teachers had developed a ""culture of low expectations"", while leaders had failed to act decisively to halt the decline in pupils' achievement. There was, however, some praise for the acting head teacher. Inspectors said he had introduced a number of improvement measures and some were ""beginning to have an impact"". A report on Lakeside School highlighted similar concerns, criticising teachers for not sufficiently challenging pupils and for having ""over generous"" predictions of their achievement. Inspectors said many pupils, whether high achievers or those with special educational needs, were ""not making the progress they should"" and achievements at GCSE were well below the national average. Governors were also criticised for not holding leaders to account, while the report said management had failed to effectively monitor either pupils or teachers.

But UKIP chairman Paul Oakden said the letter did not follow proper process. A UKIP assembly group spokesman said the letter was written by a group with a ""long-standing grudge"" against the AM. The ruling NEC body discussed the issue at a meeting on Friday, where they also decided to allow a controversial anti-Islam campaigner to run for the UKIP leadership. Mr Oakden said: ""A member of the NEC had contacted the person that is putting this forward and said to them they need to follow the proper process of completing the necessary forms and submitting them to the NEC. ""Members simply emailing the NEC saying we want you to do this is not the correct disciplinary process for the party, by any stretch of the imagination. ""A member of the NEC has gone back and given advice on what they need to do."" Shaun Owen, secretary of UKIP's Delyn branch, wrote to the NEC saying: ""For some time we have been appalled by the abrasive and discourteous manner of Ms Brown towards UKIP locally. ""Her lack of effort in pursuing the aims of the party both locally and nationally is of concern to members across the region."" Mr Owen added he believed members would stop supporting UKIP if Ms Brown remained in the role. However, a spokesman for the party's assembly group dismissed the letter as written by a ""tiny and insignificant group"".

""Unhappily, my body seems to be constructed in such a way that it keeps me alive in great discomfort when all I want is to be allowed to slip into a sleep, peacefully, legally and without any threat to the medical or nursing profession. ""I am sure there are many others like me who having finished with life wish their life to finish. ""Only with a legal euthanasia Bill on the statute books will the many people who find themselves in the same situation as me be able to slip away peacefully in their sleep instead of dreading the night."" The crossbench peer voted against an Assisted Dying Bill in 2006 because of concerns that people with learning disabilities might become the unwilling victims of euthanasia. He has been a prominent campaigner for people with learning disabilities after his daughter was born with Down's syndrome. He said his children were ""absolutely supportive"" of his decision and that he has ""wrapped up"" his affairs and was ""ready to go"" to ""put an end to this misery, pain and discomfort"". ""I can't do anything but lie here thinking 'Oh Christ, why am I still here?' They won't let me die and that's all I want to do,"" he said. He added the doctors and nurses ""do their best for me"" but that it was ""not good enough because what I want is to die, and the law stops them from helping me with that"". He had discussed with his children the possibility of travelling to the Dignitas clinic in Switzerland, but felt it would be ""unfair to them to push them into a situation where they are helping me to die"". Lord Rix said he had not been given an estimate from doctors as to how long he will live, adding: ""I think it's wrong that people like me are stranded like this. ""I'm not looking for something that helps me only, I'm thinking of all the other people who must be in the same dreadful position.""

To tell a story about a woman who divorced her husband because he didn't like her face.

What is the main idea of the article?

A woman divorced","Though the unverified story was short on details, and did not have the husband's side of the story, ""divorced because of fat face"" quickly became a top trend on microblogging network Weibo. State media picked up the story on Thursday, which was first reported in a local evening paper earlier this week. Liaoshen Wanbao reported the 49-year-old woman in Shenyang city had claimed her husband had divorced her 10 years ago because he disliked the shape of her face, said to be ""large and square"" with ""fat cheeks"". She said it spurred her to undergo facial surgery three times at a local hospital to shave her jawbones and reshape her face into a slimmer shape. During the third surgery the doctors discovered that if they proceeded further her nerves may be damaged, and halted the procedure. The woman, identified only by her surname Wang, later sued the hospital for 1.7 million yuan ($260,900; Â£183,900) in damages. She alleged the surgery had left her with soreness in her chin, and she could only eat and drink through a straw as ""when she exerted force on her lower jaw, she had the sensation that it would break"". The hospital, however, argued that the surgeries were conducted according to regulations, and pointed out that they encouraged her to seek psychiatric help instead of a third operation, which she refused. After mediation the woman agreed to accept 20,000 yuan ($3,100, Â£2,200) as compensation, said the report. On Weibo, some condemned the woman's husband, but others also chastised the woman. One top-voted comment read: ""It's purely an excuse, if her face was large then why did he decide to marry her in the first place? If he stopped loving her then he should have just said so."" It continued: ""This woman is also very silly to have believed that her face shape was the real reason for the divorce, she is lying to herself."" Said another Weibo user: ""Even if you had gone for facial surgery and made your face smaller, he would still have found other reasons to divorce you."" One person noted the sharp difference in the compensation amount and voiced suspicions: ""1.7 million was dropped to 20,000, it makes me wonder if she really did have a problem with her jaw."" Still others took the opportunity to crack jokes. ""What an odd reason for divorce! I wonder how square was this woman's square-shaped face? Like a television set? Microwave oven?"" Plastic surgery has long been a hot topic on Weibo. In December, users similarly expressed outrage when a Chinese man took out a newspaper advertisement pleading for his wife to go for plastic surgery. More than seven million cosmetic surgeries were performed in China in 2014. The industry's value, pegged at around 400bn yuan, is expected to double by 2019, according to the China Association of Plastics and Aesthetics.",1,2,2

It was sent to UKIP's national executive committee (NEC) before a row over racial slurs about a Labour MP, for which Ms Brown apologised. But UKIP chairman Paul Oakden said the letter did not follow proper process. A UKIP assembly group spokesman said the letter was written by a group with a ""long-standing grudge"" against the AM. The ruling NEC body discussed the issue at a meeting on Friday, where they also decided to allow a controversial anti-Islam campaigner to run for the UKIP leadership. Mr Oakden said: ""A member of the NEC had contacted the person that is putting this forward and said to them they need to follow the proper process of completing the necessary forms and submitting them to the NEC. ""Members simply emailing the NEC saying we want you to do this is not the correct disciplinary process for the party, by any stretch of the imagination. ""A member of the NEC has gone back and given advice on what they need to do."" Shaun Owen, secretary of UKIP's Delyn branch, wrote to the NEC saying: ""For some time we have been appalled by the abrasive and discourteous manner of Ms Brown towards UKIP locally. ""Her lack of effort in pursuing the aims of the party both locally and nationally is of concern to members across the region."" Mr Owen added he believed members would stop supporting UKIP if Ms Brown remained in the role. However, a spokesman for the party's assembly group dismissed the letter as written by a ""tiny and insignificant group"". In February, Ms Brown denied an allegation she had smoked recreational drugs in a hotel room. Later that month, she said she had acted ""with propriety"" after it was revealed she had discussed how an advert for a job in her assembly office could be changed to help her brother get an interview for the post. Meanwhile, UKIP's NEC confirmed that 11 hopefuls in the contest to succeed Paul Nuttall as leader will be able to run as candidates.

Karen Pickering, British 2001 world 4x200m freestyle gold medallist We all know how strong Peaty is. In his semi-final he was a little bit lower in the water as he set his world record.

Read on. Profile: Boris Johnson How could 'zip wire prat' become prime minister? Read more about the UK's referendum on the EU Alexander Boris de Pfeffel Johnson, to give him his full name, was born in New York and is descended from Turkish, French and German stock. He describes himself as a ""one-man melting pot"". He first made a name for himself in journalism, including a stint as Brussels correspondent for the right-wing Daily Telegraph newspaper and editor of The Spectator magazine. His humorous persona led him to become a fixture on various television programmes, including the satirical BBC panel show Have I Got News For You. He still has a lucrative and entertaining column in the Daily Telegraph, in which august forum he explained the reasons for his decision on the EU. As a politician, he has been a Conservative member of parliament for two constituencies, Henley from 2001 to 2008 and then Uxbridge and South Ruislip from 2015. Lest you think he was putting his feet up between parliamentary mandates, he is also currently serving the second of two terms as mayor of London, no mean feat in a city where the centre-left Labour Party has dominated in recent decades. That's indicative of the position Mr Johnson has carved out for himself as one of the most charismatic politicians in the UK who has wide appeal beyond Conservative heartlands - polling has suggested that his stance on the EU referendum may sway some undecided voters. Just look what happens when you type his name into Google.co.uk. Not quite.

What is the main idea of the article?

The main idea of the article is that the three bidders for BHS are Greg Tufnell, John Hargreaves and Cafer Mahiroglu.

How","BHS entered administration in April. Since then, efforts have been continuing to rescue it from closure and save the jobs of its 11,000 staff. Last week, a surprise late bid led by retail veteran Greg Tufnell transformed the race to acquire the retailer. His team, said to be backed by Portuguese money, is the front-runner. But if a deal cannot be struck, the business may still have to be liquidated. The remaining bidders have faded into the background. Another consortium led by Matalan tycoon John Hargreaves and Turkish retail entrepreneur Cafer Mahiroglu has reportedly run into difficulties, while other suitors have apparently failed to impress with their proposals. Some of those involved in the different bids have impressive retailing histories. But then Sir Philip Green, who controlled BHS from 2000 to 2015, also had a brilliant track record. And he ended up selling the business for Â£1. So what are the chances of saving BHS from the liquidators? And just who are the people aiming to do it? In the public eye, Greg Tufnell is easily overshadowed by his more famous brother Phil, the former England cricketer. But that could change if his bid for BHS is successful, because he hopes to become the firm's next chairman. And as far as his credentials for the job are concerned, the 54-year-old executive certainly talks the talk. He describes himself as ""a highly experienced managing director with Mothercare and Arcadia, a blend of entrepreneur, strategist and hands-on operator with significant commercial business turnaround, acquisition and fund-raising experience"". His record shows that he was buying and merchandising director at Next from 1991 to 1994. He then spent three years as managing director of menswear retailer Burton, part of the Arcadia group, followed by another three years as managing director of Mothercare. He currently appears to occupy a portfolio of different jobs, including the chairmanships of leather accessories brand Zatchels and recruitment consultancy hga Group. Earlier this month, he registered a new firm, Richess Group, at Companies House. Its other directors are Nick de Scossa, a Swiss banker, and Lisbon-based entrepreneur Jose Maria Soares Bento. Until Mr Tufnell's bid turned up, many observers had assumed that BHS would be snapped up by Matalan founder Mr Hargreaves. But it appears that the cost of a deal may have proved too high. Sources say Mr Hargreaves was asked to improve his offer and balked. Like Sir Philip Green, 71-year-old John Hargreaves also enjoys the life of the super-rich. He has an estimated fortune of Â£1bn, according to the Sunday Times Rich List. But in stark contrast to the ebullient Sir Philip, Mr Hargreaves is described by industry insiders as quiet-spoken, someone who shuns the limelight. Mr Hargreaves is no longer directly involved in the business he founded. He sold his 69% stake in Matalan in 2000, then in 2006 took it private through Missouri Bidco, a company 53.5% owned by him and his family.

Analysts were expecting the same figure for January to March. India is the third-largest economy in Asia but has been struggling with inflation and currency weakness. Since July last year, the Indian rupee has seen one of the biggest declines among Asian currencies, dropping more than 27% against the US dollar. ""Shocking numbers as growth was even lower than lows witnessed during the financial crisis,"" said Anubhuti Sahay from Standard Chartered Bank in Mumbai. The BBC's Yogita Limaye in Mumbai said that just a year ago India was aspiring for double-digit growth. But a global slowdown has reduced external demand, and high inflation coupled with a weak rupee has made things more expensive within the country. Domestic demand, which India's economy is largely reliant on, has also slowed in part due to the political upheaval in the country.

This contest turned nightmarish for the hosts after a bright opening, but the truth is, given their predicament, Caley Thistle did not threaten St Johnstone's goal enough. Billy Mckay sent a shot over from close range. Alex Fisher nodded a diving header wide. Carl Tremarco miscued a volley. Greg Tansey did draw a save from Alan Mannus when he rasped in an effort from outside the box, but Richie Foran's side never looked likely to find the net. Their best opportunity came immediately after the Saints went ahead, when Tansey fed Cole, who seemed to panic in a terrific position and shot straight at Mannus. Cole's dismissal ended the contest when he appeared to be cautioned twice for challenging referee Stephen Finnie's decision not to award a foul. St Johnstone were merciless and could have had more. With just one win from their last 21 league games, Inverness look deep in trouble. Tommy Wright's side deserve so much credit. Saints were tactically brilliant, so strong defensively and ruthlessly capitalised on their man advantage. They took one of their few first-half chances when Michael Coulson broke down the left and sent a dangerous ball across the six-yard box. Owain Fon Williams could only parry into the danger area, Cummins' shot was blocked but Maclean followed up to force it home. They should have had another when Craig's superb curling corner flew all the way to the back post where Cummins slid in and somehow knocked it over from two yards. Craig, in his 300th appearance for the club, coolly converted a spot-kick after Cummins was tripped to seal the points. Cummins then slammed home after Miller danced around the area to tee him up, before Craig cracked the bar amid the late flurry. With a tendency to finish the season strongly, and just a three-point gap to Rangers, the Perth side look capable of something special this term. Inverness CT manager Richie Foran: ""It is a tough time of the season to be sitting bottom, and I need real men to stand up to that, but not enough of them did that today. ""It is pure luck we are still in it and it is only four points. I sound like a broken record but one win changes it - that is the truth. But I need braver players with more passion and desire.",1,3,3

What is the difference between mead and honey wine?

Mead is made from honey and water, honey wine is made from honey and grapes.

What is the difference between mead and metheglin?","But what's brewing in this new crop of commercial meaderies - as they are known - is lot more refined from the drink that once decorated tables across medieval Europe. ""Do we have any mead makers or home brewers in the group?"" asks Ben Alexander, eying a crowd of a dozen or so people who have come to his Maine Meade Works, in Portland, on a rainy Friday for a tour. When no-one raises their hand, Mr Alexander launches into the full spiel. ""If you guys want to come around, I'll show you how this thing works,"" he says, gesturing to two ceiling-high columns of stainless steel filled with something resembling a mushy golden porridge. ""We mix up honey and water over there and we pump it through a hot water bath at 160 degrees [71C] in a stainless steel coil here. Each one produces about 50 to 75 gallons [227-340 litres] of mead a day,"" explains Mr Alexander. It's fair to say he is obsessed with mead. ""It's the quintessential local beverage - you can go anywhere in the world and find honey to make mead, and I think that's unique among alcoholic beverages,"" he gushes. After being introduced to the drink by a home brewer, Mr Alexander thought there were profits to be had in a commercial meadery. He founded Maine Mead Works in 2008, pouring his savings and money from friends and family into the business. His business has since grown, along with the popularity of mead in the US. It's now a seven-person operation that manufactures more than 7,500 cases a year, shipping them as far away as China. Mr Alexander is not the only one to have caught on to the commercial potential of mead. Vicky Rowe, the owner of mead information website GotMead, says interest in the product in the US has exploded in the past decade. ""We went from 30-40 meaderies making mead to somewhere in the vicinity of 250 in the last 10 years,"" she says. ""I like to say that everything old is new again - people come back to what was good once."" Even visitors to Mr Alexander's meadery agree. Tour participant Dirk Heseman admitted that while Maine Mead Works was the first meadery he'd actually visited, he has noticed that mead ""is becoming more and more available - similar to cider"". Just this year, commercial meaderies in the US have banded together to form an industry group, the American Mead Makers Association, to better share information and encourage growth in the industry. But there's a lot of work that needs to be done to improve the image of a drink long associated with Renaissance fairs and medieval re-enactments. ""I think our number one challenge as an industry is awareness of what mead is,"" says Mr Alexander. ""You ask 10 people in a room if they've ever heard of mead, and two of them might say, 'yes', and only one of them has had a very positive experience."" The mead of the past was often sweet, and didn't appeal to many drinkers",1,3,3

Morocco controls two-thirds of Western Sahara and sees it as part of its historic territory. However some, including the UN, see Western Sahara as Africa's last colony. Africa Live: More on this and other stories Find out more about Western Sahara A referendum was promised in 1991 but never carried out due to wrangling over who was eligible to vote. Thousands of Sahrawi refugees still live in refugee camps in Algeria - some have been there for 40 years. It is not clear what happens next but Western Sahara is hopeful that a committee set up by the AU will address the issues that both sides have raised. Some AU delegates said that it would be easier to resolve the issue with Morocco inside the AU. Sidi Mohammed, a Western Sahara official, told the BBC that Morocco's return to the AU means that it would now be expected to put ""in practice decisions taken by the AU with regard to a referendum in Western Sahara"". Mr Mohammed dismissed the suggestion that Morocco would now seek to get the AU to change its position, saying that the no country could unilaterally change the AU fundamental agreement, saying it opposed colonisation. In his speech at the AU summit, King Mohammed VI of Morocco said the readmission was not meant to divide the continental body. No. Algeria has always been a big supporter of Western Sahara's Polisario Front and it had wanted Morocco to accept independence of the territory as a condition for readmission. Zimbabwe and South Africa were also supportive of this stance but they were outnumbered by those who wanted Morocco back in the fold. There is no specific provision in the AU charter that bars any country from joining it. Morocco simply applied and the request was accepted by more than two-thirds of the 53 members. Morocco has been involved in intense lobbying and applied in July last year to rejoin the continental body. King Mohammed toured various African countries seeking support for the bid. No. While culturally the country's identity aligns with Arab states, its economic interests increasingly lie in Africa. This is a strategic move to continue exploring its interests in mining, construction, medical, insurance and banking sectors on the continent.

But they were eventually beaten by the fading light, finishing 25 runs short of a famous victory","Pakistan seemed to be cruising to a draw before debutant Adil Rashid - who returned 0-163 in the first innings - turned the match with five wickets. Needing 99 to win, England sent out Jos Buttler and Ben Stokes in the top four. But they were eventually beaten by the fading light, finishing 25 runs short of a famous victory on 74-4. The tourists could not find the boundary frequently enough before the umpires brought the teams off, with Joe Root 33 not out. However, this was a hugely impressive performance from England and one that will fill them with confidence ahead of the second Test in Dubai, which begins on Thursday. After England concluded their innings on 598-9 in the morning, Pakistan looked assured at 113-3 shortly after tea, leading by 38 with seven second-innings wickets remaining. But the match turned when veteran batsman Younus Khan, playing in his 102nd Test match, mistimed a wild heave to give Rashid his first Test wicket - caught at point by Stokes. Rashid - whose figures in the first innings were the worst ever by a debutant - then quickly added a second victim, having Asad Shafiq caught behind for six. The door was opened for England, and Rashid and Moeen Ali barged through it as they polished off the last five wickets for 14 runs. Pakistan skipper Misbah ul-Haq - who had played with restraint for his 51 - inexplicably aimed an uncharacteristic slog at Moeen and was bowled. Moeen then removed Wahab Riaz caught behind, before Rashid claimed the final three wickets - all superbly caught at first slip by James Anderson. England sensed an unlikely victory, but their reorganised batting order could not score quickly enough as Pakistan's tactic of spin from both ends and fielders on the boundary brought them regular wickets. Makeshift opener Buttler was trapped lbw for four, Moeen and Stokes were caught on the boundary in quick succession, and Jonny Bairstow was stumped attempting a big shot. However, in truth it was mistakes earlier in the match that ultimately proved more costly as England fell just short of their first win on the subcontinent since beating India in Kolkata in 2012. In Pakistan's first innings, Ian Bell dropped Mohammad Hafeez (98) and Shafiq (107) at slip early in their innings. And Shoaib Malik, who made 245, was dismissed off a no-ball by Stuart Broad. England captain Alastair Cook, whose record-breaking 263 in the first innings was ultimately in vain, admitted England were frustrated to come so close to victory.

Ricky Burns is a Scottish boxer who won the WBA Super Lightweight World Title on Saturday, March 1,","With three defeats in his previous six bouts, the Scottish boxer's career seemed to be on the wane. But his power, timing and focus returned in a supremely confident display at Glasgow's Hydro on Saturday night as he clinched the vacant WBA World Super-Lightweight title - and entered the record books as the first Scot to win world titles at three weights. Italy's Michele Di Rocco, at 34 a year older than Burns, hadn't lost a fight since September 2007. He arrived with a record of 40 wins and a draw from 42 bouts. He left a lesser figure. The referee deemed the man from Assisi to be in no state to continue in the eighth round, the result of a welter of blows to his head and body and made all the more unbearable by the hostile acoustic energy generated by 8,000 Scottish fans. Surely, for Burns, this was time to shout about his record, the ideal moment to counter all those who had written him off and questioned the wisdom of him leaving trainer Billy Nelson two years ago to work with Tony Sim in Essex? No. Instead, the champion spoke of his disbelief at the ease of his victory, his gratitude that he was safe, of his thanks to promoter Eddie Hearn, manager Alex Morrison and coach Sim for believing in him, and of his desire to celebrate with a fast-food burger and 20 chicken nuggets. ""When I got in the ring after the fight, I said, 'You've done it! You've done it!',"" reported a beaming Hearn at the post-fight media conference. ""And you know what Ricky said? 'Can you get a picture with me and Michael Buffer [the legendary American boxing ring announcer]?'"" When he has time to reflect during a well-earned holiday, Burns will take immense satisfaction at being only the third British-born fighter, after Bob Fitzsimmons and Duke McKenzie, to be a three-weight world champion. In Scottish terms, his achievements must mean that he is in the very top tier of boxing greats, comfortably mentioned in the same breath as former world champions Benny Lynch, Walter McGowan, Jackie Paterson, Ken Buchanan and Jim Watt, for example. Burns' record stands at 40 wins from 46 bouts. Remarkably, 11 of those have been world title fights. Buchanan's exploits in the United States add lustre to his legacy, but while Burns may never have fought someone like Roberto Duran, should Hearn manage to set up a bout against Cincinnati's Adrien Broner, the four-time world champion stripped of the WBA title because he could not make the weight, then Burns could achieve little more in the sport. ""There are some big fights out there for me,"" said Burns. ""I want to fight the top names. I will fight anybody. I do super-lightweight comfortably and lightweight is still an option. I would fight Terence Crawford again if it came down to it. ""That's nearly two years I have been with Tony and things have just started clicking.

The Canadian band Arcade Fire brought a ray of sunshine to Glastonbury with a series of arms-aloft","Aided by dancers, confetti cannons and a man in a mirrored suit, the Canadian band revived revellers' spirits with a series of arms-aloft anthems.

Earlier, every stage at the event was closed after lightning struck ground. Dance act Rudimental were escorted off the main stage mid-set, and had to abandon their planned encore - Feel The Love, with guest vocalist John Newman. ""We're quite upset,"" musician Amir Amor told the BBC, ""but we had a great time anyway"". Metallica's Lars Ulrich was flying into the site by helicopter as the storm descended. ""It was kind of frightening,"" he said. ""When we landed, all the people picking us up were going, 'we didn't expect you were going to fly in this weather'. ""But the pilot didn't say anything about that. We saw the lightning up there. I thought it was pyrotechnics for Arcade Fire."" The thunderstorm heralded a brief but torrential downpour, and the power cut took BBC coverage off the air. Music resumed on the main stage at 19:00 BST with Lily Allen, who dedicated an expletive-laden song to FIFA president Sepp Blatter. Other performers on Friday included Blondie, who proved so popular it became impossible to enter or leave The Other Stage at lunchtime, and Paolo Nutini, whose soulful ballads were a fitting soundtrack as dusk fell over Somerset. Sophie Ellis-Bextor sneaked some disco into her set at the largely-acoustic Avalon Stage, while the pulsing synthpop of Glaswegian band Chvrches made for a steamy atmosphere in the John Peel tent as fans danced off the downpour. Arcade Fire took to the stage shortly after 22:00 BST, their arrival heralded by a man dressed from head-to-toe in a mirrored suit. Bravely, considering the weather conditions, the 12-piece band were largely dressed in white, but if they were worried about laundry bills, it didn't show. They threw themselves around the stage, thrashing and spinning as though plagued by a swarm of invisible bees, each member switching instruments between - and often during - songs. As well as guitars, they played steel drums, xylophones and even a hurdy gurdy. Frontman Win Butler made frequent excursions into the audience and, during the song Flashbulb Eyes, plucked a camera from a press photographer and carried it on stage to capture the band's performance. The set list was evenly spread across their four albums, with highlights including No Cars Go, Neighborhood #1 (Tunnels) and Rebellion (Lies). The group's recurring subject matter of suburban despair and alienation might have seemed like an odd fit for Glastonbury's peace and love ethos, but there is an optimism and belief in humanity at the core of their music.

What is the tone","The woman, 37-year-old Wu Shuoyan, is alleged to have been killed last May simply for refusing to hand over her phone number to cult members. The murder, filmed on CCTV and on mobile phones, sparked outrage. The Church of the Almighty God cult is banned in China but claims to have millions of members. Following the brutal killing in May, Chinese authorities said that they detained hundreds of members of the cult, reports the BBC's Martin Patience in Beijing. Interviewed in prison later, one of the defendants, Zhang Lidong showed no remorse. He said: ""I beat her with all my might and stamped on her too. She was a demon. We had to destroy her."" The group had entered a small McDonalds branch in Zhaoyuan in Shandong province last May soliciting phone numbers and hoping to recruit members to their cult. Ms Wu was waiting in the restaurant with her seven-year-old son and when she refused to give her number, an act which prompted the beating while they screamed at other diners to keep away or they would face the same fate. The public face of the Church of the Almighty God is a website full of uplifting hymns and homilies. But its core belief is that God has returned to earth as a Chinese woman to wreak the apocalypse. The only person who claims direct contact with this god is a former physics teacher, Zhao Weishan, who founded the cult 25 years ago and has since fled to the United States, says BBC China Editor Carrie Gracie. No-one knows exactly where he is, but much of the website's message of outright hostility to the Chinese government is delivered in English as well as Chinese. The cult complains that religious faith has suffered from persecution by the Communist Party. Since the McDonald's murder, public outrage has forced the authorities to increase pressure on the Church of the Almighty God with almost daily arrests and raids.",1,1,3

The Glasgow and Clyde Valley City Deal involved massive investment by both the Scottish and UK governments last year. Eight councils - Glasgow, East Renfrewshire, Renfrewshire, Inverclyde, North and South Lanarkshire and East and West Dunbartonshire - are involved. The City Deal scheme will see Westminster and Holyrood give £500m each in additional grant funding to the eight council areas. The councils will supplement this by borrowing £130m. Councillors from across all eight areas will meet to discuss some of the schemes. Several of the projects being discussed later are in East Renfrewshire, where £44m is expected to be invested over the next few years, with much of the money coming from the City Deal funding. One is a water sports park at the Dams to Darnley Country Park. It would open in 2017 and include a centre offering wakeboarding, the fastest-growing extreme sport in the world. A new railway station in Barrhead and sliproad from the M77 would serve an area which could become one of East Renfrewshire's fastest growth areas. The council expects 1,000 new homes to be built there. Another project would transform the Levern Works site in Barrhead. A site formerly occupied by Nestle, where pet food was once made, would be cleared. The site will then be marketed for development for a range of uses that will bring new jobs to Barrhead.

The Egyptian revolution was a result of a Facebook invitation.","This revolution is the result of someone sending a Facebook invitation to many people. I got it like other people on our network. The buzz around it was then created on different social media websites and with videos. I was here on 25 January when riot police forced us out and by the 28th, we were back following the violence. I've been sleeping here most of the time since. Our social network was established in 2005, when there was a democratic opening around the time of the presidential elections. People from different backgrounds all met through blogging and hoped to use technology for social change. It meant we have all gained good contacts, experience and strong networks. I like to think the social network is the people itself. Things like Facebook, Twitter, SMS and phones are just social tools. When they blocked Facebook and shut down technology, our network still operated because it's about people. Internet activists are also people and a lot of our organising, social work and relationships are developed offline. This is something that people dreamt of but didn't anticipate happening in reality. If anything, it shows that all the effort we put in over the past few years has not been wasted. It has climaxed into this critical mass of people you see in the square. At the moment I'm not getting a lot of internet connection. I'm trying not to drain my phone battery. We're still using it to distribute footage people are bringing to us that we've sorted through. I hope the internet will continue to play a complementary role in activism. At the moment we physically exist in downtown Cairo and I hope that when we have finished this sit-in, we will have won the right to organise ourselves outside the internet. Twitter: Amr Gharbeia I was involved in this revolution from the first day, 25 January, and I've now been spending my nights here for a while. For the past five years, I was very active online, blogging and tweeting. As we live under emergency laws in Egypt it has been very difficult to meet or communicate except on the internet. I'd never been part of a demonstration on the ground. At first we were mocking the event on 25 January. We questioned whether it was really possible to have a ""Facebook revolution"". I came on the 25th because I felt it was my duty as a citizen and I couldn't believe how it turned into something so different from what we've seen before. I was walking among the people and weeping. Now I sometimes just tweet to update people about what's going on or to call for a million-man demonstration or a day to remember our martyrs. I'm well-known among bloggers for my long articles and constant tweets, but once I was here I stopped communicating this way so much. I felt it was totally different to have real freedom rather than just hypothetical freedom or internet freedom. Blogging and tweeting has been important as we were building our minds.

It also says they should not ratify a similar deal that has already been done between the EU and Canada. It says some aspects pose a threat to democracy and the rule of law. One of the concerns mentioned in the petition is the idea of tribunals that foreign investors would be able to use in some circumstances to sue governments. There is a great deal of controversy over exactly what this system, known as Investor State Dispute Settlement, would enable companies to do, but campaigners see it as an opportunity for international business to get compensation for government policy changes that adversely affect them. This kind of provision exists in many bilateral trade and investment agreements. Friends of the Earth have published new research on the impact they have had on EU countries. Information about these cases is not always made public, but the group says that going back to 1994, foreign investors have sought compensation of almost €30bn (£24bn) from 20 states. Where the results are known (a small minority of the total), the tribunals have awarded total compensation of €3.5bn (about £2.8bn). In Britain, the possible implications of this provision for the National Health Service have been especially controversial. Campaigners believe that the investor tribunals would make it harder to reverse any decisions to contract services out to international healthcare firms. John Hilary of War on Want said: TTIP ""will make it impossible for any future government to repeal the Health & Social Care Act and bring the NHS back into public hands"". The petition lists a number of other areas where its signatories believes European standards would suffer if the TTIP negotiations are completed and the Canada deal is ratified: employment, social, environmental, privacy and consumer protection. The European Commission says the EU will not have to sacrifice its high standards. It also says investor protection provisions are important for investment flows and have in general worked well. But it accepts there is a need for improvement and is trying to achieve that in its bilateral negotiations. The petition has been organised as an exercise called a European Citizens' Initiative which can lead to a public hearing in the European Parliament and require the European Commission to give a formal response explaining why it is accepting or rejecting what the petitioners call for.

The apes began to disappear from the documents about 150 years ago, corresponding with population growth. The study is published in the Proceedings of the Royal Society B. Hainan gibbons are now limited to a few isolated patches of forest in the south west of China. They live in just four social groups, one of which was only discovered a few weeks ago. Understanding this population crash has been difficult, but the old government documents have helped to reveal when and how the numbers fell. Dr Sam Turvey, from the Zoological Society of London, said: ""China is one of the few places in the world that has a very very rich, long historical record. ""Because it has had such a complex bureaucracy for so long, there has been a lot of need for reporting - not just numbers of households for tax purposes and things like that, but also in terms of the kinds of natural resources that were available in the immediate environment."" These included records of animals, including gibbons, he said. ""We looked at the pattern of disappearance of gibbons through time and how that varied from place to place and the different environmental conditions and human pressures that were also present in these places."" The archives show that gibbons were a common sight in about 20 provinces in China well into the 17th and 18th Century. However, Dr Turvey said it was ""a stark contrast to their very imperilled position today"". ""We see a really steep increase in population decline and real population collapse across China about 100-150 years ago,"" he added. ""And this correlates with demographic expansion in China towards the end of the Imperial era and through the 20th Century, and the massive increase in deforestation and human population growth through the time of the Chinese Republic and the establishment of the communist party."" The researchers said a better understanding of the animals' decline would help them to establish a conservation plan for the country's last few Hainan gibbons. Dr Turvey said: ""It is an incredible privilege to be able to see gibbons in China in the wild.

Uhuru Kenyatta, who faces trial at the International Criminal Court, has been leading in early presidential results declared from Monday's tightly contested election. He is due to stand trial at The Hague next month for allegedly fuelling violence after the disputed 2007 election. He denies the charge. His closest rival is outgoing Prime Minister Raila Odinga. With provisional results in from more than 40% of polling stations earlier on Wednesday, Mr Odinga had 42% of the vote compared with Mr Kenyatta's 53%. However, Mr Odinga's allies remain confident that he will gain ground as results from his strongholds, including the Coast Province, are declared. More than 1,000 people were killed in the violence which broke out in 2007-08 after Mr Odinga claimed he had been cheated of victory by supporters of President Mwai Kibaki, who is stepping down after two terms in office. The BBC's Solomon Mugera in the capital, Nairobi, says Kenyans are becoming increasingly anxious about the delay in finalising the results. Some businesses and schools across the country have remained shut since Monday's election, he says.

Its website had stopped giving updated results from the presidential race on Wednesday, and was still showing figures from Tuesday night.

David Noble, group chief executive at the Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply (CIPS), said: ""Recent fears over a stall in the UK's manufacturing sector have now become a reality. ""An atmosphere of deep unease is building throughout the manufacturing supply chain, eating away at new orders, reducing British exports and putting more jobs at risk. ""A sense of apprehension across the sector is being caused by enduring volatility in the oil and gas industry, falling retailer confidence and the uncertainty created by the EU referendum."" The Markit/CIPS survey found new export orders contracted for the fourth straight month in April as the global economy continued to slow.

At least nine clinical commissioning groups (CCGs) were offering GP practices payments for hitting targets, according to Pulse's investigation. In one case, Birmingham South Central CCG was offering practices more than Â£11,000 to reduce new outpatient attendances, follow-ups, A&E attendances and emergency admissions by 1%, compared with 2014/15. It said the schemes, which exclude cancer referrals, were designed to ""incentivise best quality practice"" and ""drive improvements in the quality of primary medical care"". ""Our priority is to ensure that patients have access to services that they need, when they need them,"" said a spokesperson for Birmingham South Central CCG. Another CCG told Pulse it had considered the ""full impact"" of the incentive scheme and was ""confident that there is no conflict of interest"". Pulse said that one scheme had already been looked at by the General Medical Council, the body which regulates medical standards in the UK, after local GP leaders expressed their concern. The magazine pointed out that initial hospital referrals for cancer patients should happen within two weeks of a GP first suspecting the condition. Dr Chand Nagpaul, chairman of the GPs committee of the doctors' trade union the British Medical Association, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that such schemes were a ""financial contaminant"" to patient-doctor trust. He said: ""It's short-sighted and misguided of CCGs to introduce such mechanisms, because they do lead to the potential for patients questioning the motives of GP referrals.

Dr Peter Melton is local GP and clinical chief officer for North East Lincolnshire CCG, which offers the equivalent of more than Â£6,000 to practices that reduce outpatient referrals to the same level as the 25% with the lowest referral rates (which include two-week urgent cancer referrals) in 2014/15.

""We thought he would make a full recovery, we expected him to come back to work in due course, so we're all shocked, but particularly Sharon and her daughters."" Mrs McAllister condemned the behaviour of some paramilitary inmates at Maghaberry Prison, who reportedly cheered, smoked cigars and mocked wardens at the high-security jail when news of Mr Ismay's death filtered through. ""This was just unacceptable behaviour by a very small number of prisoners,"" said Mrs McAllister. ""My colleagues in Maghaberry dealt with it professionally, with great fortitude and with the courage they display on a daily basis."" She admitted she and her colleagues in the Prison Service felt ""very angry"" on hearing the reports of the celebrations in the exercise yard of the prison. ""We encounter challenging behaviour by a small number of prisoners every day, and we deal with it with great professionalism and we do not stoop to behaving that way in response,"" she added. A man appeared in court on Saturday charged in connection with the bomb attack on Mr Ismay. Det Ch Insp Richard Campbell said it was ""yet another difficult day for the Ismay family, his friends and colleagues as they struggle to come to terms with the events of the past 12 days"".

Summarize the above article in 1 paragraph.","It means bloggers with more than 3,000 daily readers must register with the mass media regulator, Roskomnadzor, and conform to the regulations that govern the country's larger media outlets. Internet companies will also be required to allow Russian authorities access to users' information. One human rights group called the move ""draconian"". The law was approved by Russia's upper house of parliament in April. It includes measures to ensure that bloggers cannot remain anonymous, and states that social networks must maintain six months of data on its users. The information must be stored on servers based in Russian territory, so that government authorities can gain access. Critics see it as the latest in a series of recent moves to curb internet freedom. Hugh Williamson, of New York-based Human Rights Watch, has called the law ""another milestone in Russia's relentless crackdown on free expression"". ""The internet is the last island of free expression in Russia and these draconian regulations are clearly aimed at putting it under government control,"" he added. Opposition figures have used the internet to air their views, with some gaining millions of followers. Commentators opposing Vladimir Putin often face restrictions in broadcast outlets and newspapers. Analysis: Famil Ismailov, news editor, BBCRussian.com Russian bloggers are bracing themselves for the moment when Russia's new ""information security law"" comes into force on 1 August. Some already share advice on how to use proxy servers in order to access social media sites that, in their view, are under threat of being closed. It is hard to see how the law will be enforced. The servers for most of the popular social media platforms that many Russians use are based outside Russia. Many popular bloggers are already looking for, and apparently finding, ways to ""cheat"" the feature that counts page visits and keep their daily unique visitor numbers just under 3000, or to make sure that the statistics are hidden altogether. Anton Nossik, who is considered Russia's ""internet guru"", wrote in his LiveJournal blog that the new law didn't threaten individual bloggers directly, but provided legal grounds to block popular social networks like Facebook, Twitter, LiveJournal and Google. ""The issue of banning all these platforms in Russia is a political one and it will be decided by only one person"", Mr Nossik wrote, with a thinly veiled reference to President Vladimir Putin. Earlier in the year, Russia enacted a law that gave the government powers to block websites without explanation. In March, Moscow blocked the blog of Mr Navalny, along with two news sites and a organisation run by Garry Kasparov - a vocal critic of the Russian government. In a statement, Russia's prosecutor general's office said the blocks were imposed because of the sites' role in helping stage illegal protests. Earlier this week, Twitter blocked access to an anti-Kremlin account that often publishes leaked government documents, following a request by Russia's federal communications agency Roskomnadzor. For many years, Russia had relatively lax internet laws. However Moscow has recently changed its tune, with Mr Putin branding the internet an ongoing ""CIA project"". He also claimed that",1,2,4

The Scottish Government is cutting the funding to sport in Scotland by 20% in the next three years.

The cuts are being blamed on reduced government spending and a drop in National Lottery ticket sales - a major contributor to sports backing. Governing bodies are bracing themselves for potential job losses. About 60% of funding is made up from Scottish Government money, with lottery sales making up the rest. In the year ending 2015, total revenue was £65.1m, which is divided up and awarded to 52 sports. By the end of next year, that figure will have fallen to £51.8m - a cut to the Scottish sporting budget of 20% in just three years. sportscotland chairman Mel Young said: ""It's heartbreaking to me because I know the effort the sport governing bodies and the community that's around it; the volunteers and the mums and dads. ""And, to have to say that we're having to cut some money back is, I believe, not the right way to go."" Former badminton player Susan Egelstaff, a double bronze medallist at the Commonwealth Games [in 2002 and 2006] and an Olympian, fears the cuts will have ""a huge impact"". ""What that means in the future is that Scotland will be constantly playing catch-up,"" she said. ""It's almost impossible to catch up if you fall too far behind the leading nations."" The Scottish Government said sport and physical activity play a ""key role"" in a healthy Scotland and that ""significant"" investment would continue in those areas. ""Having successfully delivered the Commonwealth Games [in 2014] we are now focusing on protecting or raising investment in areas intended to decrease health inequality and improve life chances, and the small reduction in the sport budget allows us to support those priorities,"" Minister for Sport Aileen Campbell said. ""There is on-going support for active lifestyles through capital investment in cycling and walking, and over the last 10 years we have invested £168m in sport infrastructure - from grassroots to the elite performance which has increased the facilities and opportunities to get people active and achieve on the world stage at both the Olympics and Commonwealth Games.""",1,3,4

The system would appoint a named person - usually a teacher or health visitor - to ensure the wellbeing of every child. But judges at the UK's highest court ruled against the scheme in July 2016, citing concerns over information sharing. The Supreme Court judges said some proposals breached rights to privacy and a family life under the European Convention on Human Rights. However, the court said the aim of the Act, which is intended to promote and safeguard the rights and wellbeing of children and young people, was legitimate. Speaking ahead of his statement to the Scottish Parliament, Mr Swinney said the Scottish government remained ""absolutely committed"" to the Named Person service as a way to support children and their families.

Archaeologist David Jacques, said: ""They... used the stump of the tree, about three metres high, as a wall."" The finds are being shown to United Nations heritage experts, who are currently visiting Stonehenge. Archaeologists are concerned a planned 2.9km tunnel being considered for the nearby A303 main road will damage the site. Discoveries have also shown stones were warmed up by the Mesolithic Period inhabitants and used in a hearth to emit heat in the earthy snug. Mr Jacques, a senior research fellow at the University of Buckingham, has worked at Blick Mead for over a decade, making a number of discoveries about the inhabitants. The tree stump created a wall height similar to a ""modern bungalow"". ""They've draped probably animal skins or thatch around the basin and connected it to a post so it's a very comfortable snug little place,"" he said. The wooden wall of the hollow was lined with flints and the large earthy pit created by the tree root lined with cobbles and decorated with ""exotic"" stones from outside the area. ""There are some clever and sophisticated things going on, the hot stones that they put into this little type of alcove wouldn't have been on fire,"" explained Mr Jacques.

The Supreme Court has upheld the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, in a 6-3 decision.

What are","In a 6-3 decision, the justices said that tax subsidies that make health insurance affordable for low-income individuals can continue. The ruling preserves the law known as Obamacare, which Mr Obama considers a major part of his presidential legacy. Republicans have vowed to continue fighting the law. ""We've got more work to do, but what we're not going to do is unravel what has now been woven into the fabric of America,"" Mr Obama said. The case, known as King v Burwell, was the second major challenge the law has faced in the US's highest court. Unlike in many other western countries, the US does not have a single-payer healthcare system. Private companies, rather than the US government, provide health insurance for US citizens. The enactment of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) - one of Mr Obama's most significant and controversial domestic achievements - in 2010 mandated that every American had to purchase private insurance. It provided the subsidies to allow many to do so. In 2012, the mandate portion of the law was challenged in the court. The justices ruled to preserve it. In that decision, as in the decision on Thursday, Chief Justice John Roberts surprised observers by siding with his liberal colleagues in support of the law. ""Congress passed the Affordable Care act to improve health insurance markets, not to destroy them,"" Chief Justice John Roberts wrote in the opinion. Justice Anthony Kennedy dissented in 2012, but sided with the majority on Thursday. Had the court made the opposite decision, an estimated 8.7 million people in the US would have been at risk of losing the aid that makes healthcare affordable. The stakes could not have been higher. People's health (crucially important) and Obama's legacy (less important, but for him and those around him fairly vital) were at stake. Well a politically finely balanced Supreme Court has given an emphatic, overwhelming vote in favour of the president by 6-3. I bet ""No-drama Obama"" is high-fiving anyone and everyone in the White House - that is how big it is. Obama defies lame-duck expectations Demonstrators gathered outside the court as early on Thursday morning. Reading updates on their mobile phones, the crowd became jubilant when they learned mid-morning that the court had ruled in their favour. Some began dancing, while others chanted ""If you're covered and you know it clap your hands."" ""This is a big sigh of relief for millions across the country,"" said Ron Pollack of Families USA, a health-care advocacy organisation. ""The ACA is not just the law of the land, it will remain the law of the land"". ""Today is a good day for healthcare in America,"" said activist Benton Strong. ""I hope this is the end of the line."" Demonstrators opposing the subsidies did not have a large visible presence. Justice Antonin Scalia wrote in his dissent that the Supreme Court is setting a precedent of favouring some laws over others.

Wrockwardine Wood and Sutherland academies, also run by the Telford Co-operative Multi-Academy Trust, were put in special measures earlier this week. The trust has not commented. Ofsted criticised the trust's lack of support to the schools and said each was now considering an alternative sponsor. Inspectors said pupils' achievement at the Phoenix Academy had dropped since it became an academy in 2013 and their latest report rated it inadequate in all areas. A report in 2013, before it converted, rated the secondary school as ""requiring improvement"", while Lakeside was rated ""good"" in 2012 under its former name the Lord Silkin School. In the latest report, inspectors said the curriculum at Phoenix Academy was ""inadequate"", while ""weak teaching"" meant pupils were not sufficiently challenged and were often ""disengaged and disruptive"". There was particular criticism of standards in English and maths which the watchdog said were limiting pupils' achievements in other areas. Ofsted's report said governors, managers and teachers had developed a ""culture of low expectations"", while leaders had failed to act decisively to halt the decline in pupils' achievement. There was, however, some praise for the acting head teacher. Inspectors said he had introduced a number of improvement measures and some were ""beginning to have an impact"". A report on Lakeside School highlighted similar concerns, criticising teachers for not sufficiently challenging pupils and for having ""over generous"" predictions of their achievement. Inspectors said many pupils, whether high achievers or those with special educational needs, were ""not making the progress they should"" and achievements at GCSE were well below the national average.

The Foreign Office has said it is in contact with the Turkish authorities. The BBC's Mark Lowen said the information about the ages of the children had not been independently verified and it was too early to know where the group were intending to head to. ""Were they heading for one of the more moderate groups in Syria. Were they heading for the area controlled by al-Nusra, the al-Qaeda affiliate?

At the party's weekly press briefing, I asked the Welsh Conservative leader Andrew RT Davies, who was elected on the list, whether he'd stand as a constituency candidate in his home turf of the Vale of Glamorgan but he said he hadn't thought about it. Presumably those are the kind of decisions they will now feel more confident contemplating. The party will also have a huge amount of new data on voters which it'll be able to call upon and the belief that campaigning hard on the NHS helped the Tories cross the line in places like the Vale of Clwyd and Gower. The Conservatives feel it's them, rather than any of the other opposition parties, who have become the repository of votes from those who are disaffected by the state of the NHS. Welsh Labour are going to hold a ""short sharp"" analysis into what went wrong. Carwyn Jones was in line with most of the criticism of Ed Miliband when he told AMs that the party needed to appeal to small business owners who are not millionaires but who work hard. What will be more difficult is countering the argument on the NHS, which the former minister Alun Davies believes is already lost. Another potential difficulty for Welsh Labour will be dealing with unhappiness within the party over council re-organisation. Bernie Attridge, the deputy leader of Flintshire Council, has tweeted saying the party needs to be careful on local government reform if it wants to retain the support of grassroots councillors. It also seems to have been the case that Labour lost more votes to UKIP than the Conservatives, which is another challenge to overcome. But Labour will at least have the advantage that it will be David Cameron, and not Ed Miliband, carrying out the latest round of public sector cuts that are likely to take effect sooner rather than later. The question is whether Carwyn Jones is going to be able to turn that to his advantage when his own record in government will be under scrutiny. Plaid Cymru's education spokesman, Simon Thomas, also in the party's weekly press briefing, said he believed Leanne Wood could portray herself as an alternative first minister because of the way she emotionally connected with people in the campaign.

Why did you choose this article?

I chose this article because I wanted to read about the","His previous jobs were at Celtic and Bolton, but moving to the second tier of Scottish football was no hindrance to him returning to work at Easter Road. Lennon saw the vacancy as an opportunity, and that was enough to encourage Hibs that a figure of his profile and experience would accept a role in the Championship. Even though his last job in Scotland involved leading a team on Champions League duty, Lennon's mind has not been swayed by haughtiness. The appointment of the former Celtic manager as successor to Alan Stubbs suits both parties, because it is mutually beneficial. Success is alluring, and Hibs offer Lennon the chance to accumulate more achievements. He was immediately engaged in crisis management at his previous club Bolton, but will find stability, potential and accomplishment at Easter Road. The demand will be to deliver promotion, but that will not seem daunting when the majority of the squad that pushed Rangers for a while last season then won the Scottish Cup is still in place. Lennon's task is to refine and bolster the team, when new managers are often faced with a period of overhaul. Stubbs left the club on an emotional high after delivering their first Scottish Cup in 114 years, but before the final against Rangers there was a tangible sense of exasperation that promotion had been missed. Hibs were entitled to feel that it was an unnecessary failure given their circumstances. The club is about to embark on a third season in the Championship, but by most other measures they can be considered a top-flight outfit. The budget will be significantly more than the rest of the teams in the division, the training ground at East Mains and facilities are first-class, the football side of the business is stable and well-run by George Craig, the club's head of football operations, the squad is full of talent. Lennon can rely on consistently assured performances from the likes of David Gray, Darren McGregor, Paul Hanlon, Lewis Stevenson, John McGinn, Fraser Fyvie, Dylan McGeouch, James Keatings and Jason Cummings. Some minor issues remain, such as who will fill the goal next season, but the challenge is more on adding depth and strength of will to the squad and man-management. McGinn, one of the most reliably effective players in the Championship last season, has already insisted that he remains committed to Hibs despite the failure to achieve promotion. The 21-year-old midfielder provides the kind of industry and spirit that a team can be built around. There may be critical decisions to make, though, since Cummings is entering the final year of his contract and so represents a sellable asset. He is a regular goalscorer, though, and Stubbs had to sign Anthony Stokes on loan last January to provide some support up front. These are tweaks compared to the amount of work Stubbs had to carry out when he was appointed two years ago. Hibs are ready to be guided forward, not waiting to be rescued.

He admitted culpable homicide on the basis of diminished responsibility after saying he had no recollection of the killing at Dixon Avenue, Glasgow, on 24 September last year. Buksh will be sentenced on 27 June. The High Court in Glasgow heard that 43-year-old Mrs Buksh died after being struck on the head at least five times. Pathologists told the court that the lack of defensive injuries and the position of her body suggested she was assaulted as she slept. Following the attack, Buksh went to Cathcart Police Station and told an officer: ""I've come to hand myself in. I think my wife's dead. I hit her on the head. I did it."" The court was told that three psychiatrists described Buksh as suffering from an acute stress disorder at the time. Prosecutor Gordon Lamont said: ""The accused and his wife had been married for 25 years, but over the last 10 or 11 years their relationship appears to have broken down and they became increasingly estranged, albeit, still residing under the one roof. ""They slept separately and Mrs Buksh routinely slept on the sofa in the living room. Their children report that they barely spoke to each other."" Mr Lamont said the problems in the marriage intensified after Mrs Buksh went to Pakistan on holiday in May last year. He said she had become involved with another man and was making plans to move to Pakistan. The court also heard that two days before he killed his wife, Buksh went to Paisley Police Office and spoke with a support officer saying he feared his wife was going to take their youngest child, aged 10, to Pakistan and not return. He also made an emergency doctor's appointment and said he was suffering from stress and not sleeping. He was prescribed medication for stress. Defence counsel Sarah Livingstone said: ""My client has no memory of this incident. His amnesia is absolutely genuine. ""This is not a case where this man was a bad husband, there was no domestic abuse. This was an unhappy marriage, but however, unhappy it was it didn't justify killing his wife.

Super Bowl performers get a very strict 12-minute time limit, so most performers cram their set with as much music as possible. Not Michael Jackson.

It was a master class in ratcheting expectation to a fever pitch. And the screams when he launched into Jam (not one of his best songs) proved he knew what he was doing. Brilliantly, Jackson staged this entire performance while wearing a jacket it looked like he'd borrowed from Muammar Gaddafi. Beat that, Gaga.

The Blick Mead site is about 1.5 miles (2.4km) from Stonehenge and archaeologists said ""scientifically tested charcoal"" dug up from the site had ""revealed that it dated from around 4000 BC"". David Jacques said the dig had also found ""evidence of feasting"" including burnt flints, tools and remains of giant cattle, known as aurochs, which were eaten by early hunter gatherers. Mr Jacques said: ""British pre-history may have to be rewritten. This is the latest dated Mesolithic encampment ever found in the UK.

Downing Street did not comment on President Obama's remark to the PM about defence spending, reportedly made before Chancellor George Osborne said the government would fulfil a Nato pledge to spend 2% of national income on defence last year. In response to the interview, a spokesman for the US National Security Council said Mr Cameron had been ""as close a partner as the president has had"" adding that ""we deeply value the UK's contributions on our shared national security and foreign policy objectives"". BBC North America editor Jon Sopel said the unsolicited statement put out by the White House suggested Downing Street had reacted angrily to the article.

The former French president, he said, ""wanted to trumpet the flights he was taking in the air campaign, despite the fact that we had wiped out all the air defences and essentially set up the entire infrastructure"" for the intervention. President Obama said the intervention ""averted large-scale civilian casualties (and) prevented what almost surely would have been a prolonged and bloody civil conflict"". But he added: ""And despite all that, Libya is a mess."" He also criticised what he called ""free riders"" in the interview, saying European and Gulf countries were calling for action against Gaddafi, adding: ""But what has been a habit over the last several decades in these circumstances is people pushing us to act but then showing an unwillingness to put any skin in the game.""

She doesn't give interviews - ""Hell, no"" was her response to a request several decades ago - and that silence has only added to the intrigue. But her close friend Thomas Lane Butts, a retired minister in her hometown, Monroeville, Alabama, says she once told him the reason. Sitting on a pew in the Methodist church which the Lee family still attends, he described to me how she suddenly brought the subject up one night over dinner in New York. ""She asked me, 'You ever wonder why I didn't write anything else?' And I said, 'Along with several million other people, yes, I had wondered about that.' And she said, 'Well, what do you think?'"" Speaking in his slow southern drawl, the Rev Butts, who just turned 80, suggested to her that she had already written a great book and therefore didn't need to compete with herself. ""And when I got through she said, 'You're all wrong.' I said, 'Alright, smart Alec. You tell me.' She said, 'I would not go through all the deprivation of privacy through which I went for this book again for any amount of money.' ""And she said, 'I did not need to write another book. I said what I wanted to say in that book.'"" Harper Lee called it a simple tale about the ""conflict of the human soul"" and Monroeville, Alabama, is where she drew her inspiration. The story depicts the segregated South of her childhood, during the Depression. It was published at the height of the civil rights struggle. The Rev Butts grew up 10 miles outside Monroeville. By the late 1950s, he says, he was a ""fuzzy-cheeked young preacher"" campaigning for an end to segregation. He had met Martin Luther King Jr and signed a petition to boycott buses. The Ku Klux Klan had left a burning cross on his front lawn. He says To Kill a Mockingbird was not well received in Monroeville when it was published. ""The people who were hard racist did not like it because of the implication of the book,"" the Rev Butts told me. ""The book revealed racism and that always frightens a racist - when you pull the cover off them. ""Those of us who stood up for civil rights were much encouraged by the book because in a very skilful and subtle way it addressed itself for justice."" But these days, the Rev Butts says, there is enormous civic pride in Monroeville. The old courthouse, which Hollywood re-created for the film, now houses a museum to Harper Lee and the town's other literary icon, Truman Capote. Capote was a childhood friend of hers and is thought to be the inspiration for the Dill character in To Kill a Mockingbird.

The director of the","It is the first private clinic to offer early medical abortions to women in Northern Ireland under strict legal controls. A former leader of the Progressive Unionist Party, Ms Purvis has been director of the clinic since it was launched in 2012. Ms Purvis, who will step down on 24 April, said it was ""time to move on"". She will take on a new role on the clinic's Northern Ireland advisory board. Last November, anti-abortion protester Bernadette Smyth, who leads the Precious Life group, was convicted of harassing Ms Purvis at the Marie Stopes office in Belfast city centre. Ms Purvis told the BBC that had had no influence on her decision to step down. ""I think the clinic's well established here now, we're providing services more and more every year and I'm delighted to be remaining on the advisory board for the clinic. ""But I feel it's time to move on and I think it's time for Marie Stopes to get someone else in to manage the clinic and take it to new places,"" she said. ""At times it was difficult, particularly last year with the court case and the harassment, but I put that behind me and have concentrated on delivering services for women in Ireland both north and south. ""I think I've achieved a significant historical change in the perception of abortion in Northern Ireland from where the usual narrative was that abortion was illegal in Northern Ireland to now one where people understand that abortion is legal under certain circumstances. ""I think we've challenged the myths and stereotypes that are presented by those who are opposed to a woman's right to chose."" Genevieve Edwards, director of policy for Marie Stopes UK, said: ""We were so lucky to have Dawn and wish her every success in whatever she chooses to do.

The government has given money to councils to help them deal with the cuts, but the amount given is not","Byron Rhodes is taking me around the modern council headquarters. It's full of light. It's busy. The building has regenerated the area around Melton Mowbray's railway station, once a muddy pot-holed piece of wasteland where those in the know parked for free. Now the council offices link the station to a park and the town centre. It was partly paid for with insurance money after a fire destroyed the old offices on the other side of town. A supermarket moved in to replace it and helped with the money too, putting the council on a firm financial footing. But that was four years ago and the crisis is a different one today. It's being experienced by all local authorities - cuts in central government funding which threaten the services they provide. Mr Rhodes is also deputy leader of Leicestershire County Council, with responsibility for finance. Leicestershire is historically the poorest funded council in the country because of a quirk of Whitehall recalculations, going back a quarter of a century since the poll tax, or community charge, was scrapped. At the moment councils get income from council tax, a share of the business rates, any income they generate themselves from services plus a grant from central government. It's the grant cut which is causing them grief. What's called the ""core funding"" is worked out by the number of homes multiplied by a set amount. And each authority has a different value set per dwelling. If we look at Surrey, which is top of the table, the amount will be £1,686 by 2019/20. Nottinghamshire is mid-table at £1,482, Derbyshire is in the lower reaches with £1,422 per dwelling and then comes Leicestershire at £1,354. ""The funding system is chaotic,"" says Byron Rhodes. ""It doesn't reflect real need. Look at Oxfordshire which is an interesting example,"" he says with a glint in his eye. Could he possibly be referring to the prime ministerial plea to the county council about cutbacks to services there? ""If we had the same funding as Oxfordshire, we'd have £50m a year extra. If we had the same as Surrey, we'd have £100m more. We'd be partying everyday if we had that kind of money."" Leicestershire have been helped with a small share of what's been called transitional funding - about £300m to help councils following pressure from Conservative MPs. Think back to the vote on Sunday trading. With a majority of only 17 in the Commons, the Conservatives lost the vote when 20 odd rebelled. Last month there would've been another rebellion, including some of our own Tory MPs in the East Midlands, if something wasn't done to improve the local government finance settlement over the next four years. The money has gone largely to shire counties. Leicestershire got £6.6m spread over two years, enough to save some services from closure. But it's a drop in the ocean for an authority with a £19m black hole in the budget every year after the latest cutbacks. Labour have protested that 83% of the councils getting transition funding are Conservative-run. Many Labour-run",1,3,4

The government is cutting £1","Councils in England are facing a £1.1bn shortfall this year, on top of ""almost unendurable"" cuts since 2010, the Association of Directors of Adult Social Services has warned. Freezing care provider fees to save money was no long sustainable, it said. Ministers say extra money will help NHS and social care services work together. The survey, which was completed by 147 directors of adult social services for councils in England, suggests that funding reductions to social care budgets have totalled £4.6bn since 2010 - a 31% overall reduction. Budgets for adult social care - which provides practical support to people due to illness, disability, old age or a low income - will reduce by a further £500m in cash terms this year, it said. ""Taking the growth in numbers of older and disabled people into account, this means that an additional £1.1bn would be needed to provide the same level of service as last year,"" the report warned. It said some councils had made savings in the past by freezing fees paid to providers, but care providers were now also facing financial problems. Some companies - particularly those in southern England - are struggling to attract staff, amid increasing concern about the quality of care, it said. ""What is at stake is the continuing capacity of adult social care to sustain services to those in greatest need,"" ADASS president Ray James said. ""In virtually all our authorities, the number in need is growing, while the complexity of their needs is increasing."" ADASS called for the government to ""protect essential care and support services to the most vulnerable members of our community"". But a government spokesman said the survey ""ignores"" a commitment to invest £10bn in health services that are being ""joined up"" with social care, by 2020. The BBC has launched an online guide to the care system for the over-65s. The ""care calculator"" covers residential care and the support provided in people's own homes, for tasks such as washing and dressing. Users can submit their postcode and find out how much each service costs where they live in the UK. There is also a dedicated BBC Cost of Care website, with news stories, analysis and video. The spokesman said: ""Increasing budgets isn't the only solution. By working innovatively and joining up health and social care we can improve care and also save money."" However, Councillor Izzi Seccombe, from the Local Government Association (LGA), said adult social care services were facing ""enormous pressures"" due to ""insufficient funding, growing demand and escalating costs"". ""We have long warned that investing in the NHS whilst social care budgets are under continual pressure is simply a false economy. ""It is social care services that support elderly and vulnerable people to maintain their independence, live in their own community and stay out of hospital longer,"" she added.

What is the significance of","A ""terrorist hide"" was uncovered at Capanagh Forest near Larne after two members of the public found suspicious objects in the woods on Saturday. Some of the items found included an armour-piercing improvised rocket and two anti-personnel mines. The main line of police inquiry is the arms belonged to dissident republicans. Last week, Home Secretary Theresa May said MI5 believed an attack on targets in Great Britain by dissident republicans had become ""a strong possibility"". Analysis: Vincent Kearney, BBC News NI's home affairs correspondent The discovery of what appears to be a second dissident republican arms dump near Larne within three months has left police baffled. Based on location alone, the analysis would be that the items found most likely belonged to loyalist paramilitaries. But the nature of what was found suggests otherwise and the finger of suspicion firmly in the direction of dissident republicans. Det Supt Kevin Geddes said the threat level in Northern Ireland from dissident republican groups remains ""severe"" and an attack is ""highly likely"". Police officers found three barrels hidden in holes in the forest. As well as rockets and mines, there were also several pipe bombs, assault rifle ammunition and parts to construct a ""substantial number of explosive devices"". Det Supt Geddes said the seizure was significant ""both in terms of its size and its capability"". ""A number of these devices were ready to be deployed,"" he added. ""This seizure has undoubtedly saved lives."" He said the type of weapons that had been found meant police would focus their investigation on dissident republicans. In March, an arms find was made at Carnfunnock Country Park near Larne, and police said the were investigating a connection between the two discoveries. ""There are links in terms of the general location and the manner and method of storage and packaging of these munitions,"" Det Supt Geddes said.

Currently, more than 5,500 children are in foster care in Scotland, living with 4,400 families and carers. The Fostering Network surveyed 250 children, teenagers and foster carers across Scotland and discovered that many young people had failed to find stability. Almost half were already living with their third family, a quarter were with their fourth family and about 20 were living with their 10th family since going into care.

State media picked up the story on Thursday, which was first reported in a local evening paper earlier this week. Liaoshen Wanbao reported the 49-year-old woman in Shenyang city had claimed her husband had divorced her 10 years ago because he disliked the shape of her face, said to be ""large and square"" with ""fat cheeks"". She said it spurred her to undergo facial surgery three times at a local hospital to shave her jawbones and reshape her face into a slimmer shape. During the third surgery the doctors discovered that if they proceeded further her nerves may be damaged, and halted the procedure. The woman, identified only by her surname Wang, later sued the hospital for 1.7 million yuan ($260,900; Â£183,900) in damages. She alleged the surgery had left her with soreness in her chin, and she could only eat and drink through a straw as ""when she exerted force on her lower jaw, she had the sensation that it would break"". The hospital, however, argued that the surgeries were conducted according to regulations, and pointed out that they encouraged her to seek psychiatric help instead of a third operation, which she refused. After mediation the woman agreed to accept 20,000 yuan ($3,100, Â£2,200) as compensation, said the report. On Weibo, some condemned the woman's husband, but others also chastised the woman. One top-voted comment read: ""It's purely an excuse, if her face was large then why did he decide to marry her in the first place? If he stopped loving her then he should have just said so."" It continued: ""This woman is also very silly to have believed that her face shape was the real reason for the divorce, she is lying to herself."" Said another Weibo user: ""Even if you had gone for facial surgery and made your face smaller, he would still have found other reasons to divorce you."" One person noted the sharp difference in the compensation amount and voiced suspicions: ""1.7 million was dropped to 20,000, it makes me wonder if she really did have a problem with her jaw."" Still others took the opportunity to crack jokes. ""What an odd reason for divorce! I wonder how square was this woman's square-shaped face? Like a television set? Microwave oven?"" Plastic surgery has long been a hot topic on Weibo. In December, users similarly expressed outrage when a Chinese man took out a newspaper advertisement pleading for his wife to go for plastic surgery. More than seven million cosmetic surgeries were performed in China in 2014. The industry's value, pegged at around 400bn yuan, is expected to double by 2019, according to the China Association of Plastics and Aesthetics.",1,4,3

The police said that a post-mortem examination showed he died as a ""direct result of the injuries"" of the bomb. A dissident republican group, widely referred to as the new IRA, said it carried out the attack. The organisation said Mr Ismay was targeted for training officers at Maghaberry Prison near Lisburn, County Antrim. Sue McAllister, director general of the Northern Ireland Prison Service, spent time with the Ismay family on Wednesday. She said they were ""devastated and beyond shock at what's happened"". ""Like all of us, they thought that he was on the mend and was doing really well,"" said Mrs McAllister. ""We thought he would make a full recovery, we expected him to come back to work in due course, so we're all shocked, but particularly Sharon and her daughters."" Mrs McAllister condemned the behaviour of some paramilitary inmates at Maghaberry Prison, who reportedly cheered, smoked cigars and mocked wardens at the high-security jail when news of Mr Ismay's death filtered through. ""This was just unacceptable behaviour by a very small number of prisoners,"" said Mrs McAllister. ""My colleagues in Maghaberry dealt with it professionally, with great fortitude and with the courage they display on a daily basis."" She admitted she and her colleagues in the Prison Service felt ""very angry"" on hearing the reports of the celebrations in the exercise yard of the prison. ""We encounter challenging behaviour by a small number of prisoners every day, and we deal with it with great professionalism and we do not stoop to behaving that way in response,"" she added. A man appeared in court on Saturday charged in connection with the bomb attack on Mr Ismay. Det Ch Insp Richard Campbell said it was ""yet another difficult day for the Ismay family, his friends and colleagues as they struggle to come to terms with the events of the past 12 days"". He added: ""We have spoken to the family this morning and advised them of this development. ""We are also liaising with the Public Prosecution Service in relation to the individual who is currently charged with attempted murder and causing an explosion with intent to endanger life.""

Internet companies will also be required to allow Russian authorities access to users' information. One human rights group called the move ""draconian"". The law was approved by Russia's upper house of parliament in April. It includes measures to ensure that bloggers cannot remain anonymous, and states that social networks must maintain six months of data on its users. The information must be stored on servers based in Russian territory, so that government authorities can gain access. Critics see it as the latest in a series of recent moves to curb internet freedom. Hugh Williamson, of New York-based Human Rights Watch, has called the law ""another milestone in Russia's relentless crackdown on free expression"". ""The internet is the last island of free expression in Russia and these draconian regulations are clearly aimed at putting it under government control,"" he added. Opposition figures have used the internet to air their views, with some gaining millions of followers. Commentators opposing Vladimir Putin often face restrictions in broadcast outlets and newspapers. Analysis: Famil Ismailov, news editor, BBCRussian.com Russian bloggers are bracing themselves for the moment when Russia's new ""information security law"" comes into force on 1 August. Some already share advice on how to use proxy servers in order to access social media sites that, in their view, are under threat of being closed. It is hard to see how the law will be enforced. The servers for most of the popular social media platforms that many Russians use are based outside Russia. Many popular bloggers are already looking for, and apparently finding, ways to ""cheat"" the feature that counts page visits and keep their daily unique visitor numbers just under 3000, or to make sure that the statistics are hidden altogether. Anton Nossik, who is considered Russia's ""internet guru"", wrote in his LiveJournal blog that the new law didn't threaten individual bloggers directly, but provided legal grounds to block popular social networks like Facebook, Twitter, LiveJournal and Google. ""The issue of banning all these platforms in Russia is a political one and it will be decided by only one person"", Mr Nossik wrote, with a thinly veiled reference to President Vladimir Putin. Earlier in the year, Russia enacted a law that gave the government powers to block websites without explanation. In March, Moscow blocked the blog of Mr Navalny, along with two news sites and a organisation run by Garry Kasparov - a vocal critic of the Russian government. In a statement, Russia's prosecutor general's office said the blocks were imposed because of the sites' role in helping stage illegal protests. Earlier this week, Twitter blocked access to an anti-Kremlin account that often publishes leaked government documents, following a request by Russia's federal communications agency Roskomnadzor.

He has arguably the highest profile of any of the governing Conservative Party except the Prime Minister David Cameron, but those outside the UK may be wondering: who is he, and is that actually his hair? Read on. Profile: Boris Johnson How could 'zip wire prat' become prime minister? Read more about the UK's referendum on the EU Alexander Boris de Pfeffel Johnson, to give him his full name, was born in New York and is descended from Turkish, French and German stock. He describes himself as a ""one-man melting pot"". He first made a name for himself in journalism, including a stint as Brussels correspondent for the right-wing Daily Telegraph newspaper and editor of The Spectator magazine. His humorous persona led him to become a fixture on various television programmes, including the satirical BBC panel show Have I Got News For You. He still has a lucrative and entertaining column in the Daily Telegraph, in which august forum he explained the reasons for his decision on the EU. As a politician, he has been a Conservative member of parliament for two constituencies, Henley from 2001 to 2008 and then Uxbridge and South Ruislip from 2015. Lest you think he was putting his feet up between parliamentary mandates, he is also currently serving the second of two terms as mayor of London, no mean feat in a city where the centre-left Labour Party has dominated in recent decades. That's indicative of the position Mr Johnson has carved out for himself as one of the most charismatic politicians in the UK who has wide appeal beyond Conservative heartlands - polling has suggested that his stance on the EU referendum may sway some undecided voters. Just look what happens when you type his name into Google.co.uk. Not quite. He has previously courted controversy for his remarks about (among others) the populations of Liverpool, Portsmouth and Papua New Guinea, not to mention run-ins with his own party leadership and TV chef Jamie Oliver. Last October he accidentally flattened a 10-year-old schoolboy at what was meant to be a friendly game of photo-op rugby in Japan. But none of this seems to have affected his standing among the party faithful or the public at large.

The apes began to disappear from the documents about 150 years ago, corresponding with population growth. The study is published in the Proceedings of the Royal Society B. Hainan gibbons are now limited to a few isolated patches of forest in the south west of China. They live in just four social groups, one of which was only discovered a few weeks ago. Understanding this population crash has been difficult, but the old government documents have helped to reveal when and how the numbers fell. Dr Sam Turvey, from the Zoological Society of London, said: ""China is one of the few places in the world that has a very very rich, long historical record. ""Because it has had such a complex bureaucracy for so long, there has been a lot of need for reporting - not just numbers of households for tax purposes and things like that, but also in terms of the kinds of natural resources that were available in the immediate environment."" These included records of animals, including gibbons, he said. ""We looked at the pattern of disappearance of gibbons through time and how that varied from place to place and the different environmental conditions and human pressures that were also present in these places."" The archives show that gibbons were a common sight in about 20 provinces in China well into the 17th and 18th Century. However, Dr Turvey said it was ""a stark contrast to their very imperilled position today"". ""We see a really steep increase in population decline and real population collapse across China about 100-150 years ago,"" he added. ""And this correlates with demographic expansion in China towards the end of the Imperial era and through the 20th Century, and the massive increase in deforestation and human population growth through the time of the Chinese Republic and the establishment of the communist party."" The researchers said a better understanding of the animals' decline would help them to establish a conservation plan for the country's last few Hainan gibbons. Dr Turvey said: ""It is an incredible privilege to be able to see gibbons in China in the wild.

openai_text-ada-001,Commercial meaderies are trying to find way to bring back old-fashioned mead ingredients and products back to their past.,"But what's brewing in this new crop of commercial meaderies - as they are known - is lot more refined from the drink that once decorated tables across medieval Europe. ""Do we have any mead makers or home brewers in the group?"" asks Ben Alexander, eying a crowd of a dozen or so people who have come to his Maine Meade Works, in Portland, on a rainy Friday for a tour. When no-one raises their hand, Mr Alexander launches into the full spiel. ""If you guys want to come around, I'll show you how this thing works,"" he says, gesturing to two ceiling-high columns of stainless steel filled with something resembling a mushy golden porridge. ""We mix up honey and water over there and we pump it through a hot water bath at 160 degrees [71C] in a stainless steel coil here. Each one produces about 50 to 75 gallons [227-340 litres] of mead a day,"" explains Mr Alexander. It's fair to say he is obsessed with mead. ""It's the quintessential local beverage - you can go anywhere in the world and find honey to make mead, and I think that's unique among alcoholic beverages,"" he gushes. After being introduced to the drink by a home brewer, Mr Alexander thought there were profits to be had in a commercial meadery. He founded Maine Mead Works in 2008, pouring his savings and money from friends and family into the business. His business has since grown, along with the popularity of mead in the US. It's now a seven-person operation that manufactures more than 7,500 cases a year, shipping them as far away as China. Mr Alexander is not the only one to have caught on to the commercial potential of mead. Vicky Rowe, the owner of mead information website GotMead, says interest in the product in the US has exploded in the past decade. ""We went from 30-40 meaderies making mead to somewhere in the vicinity of 250 in the last 10 years,"" she says. ""I like to say that everything old is new again - people come back to what was good once."" Even visitors to Mr Alexander's meadery agree. Tour participant Dirk Heseman admitted that while Maine Mead Works was the first meadery he'd actually visited, he has noticed that mead ""is becoming more and more available - similar to cider"". Just this year, commercial meaderies in the US have banded together to form an industry group, the American Mead Makers Association, to better share information and encourage growth in the industry. But there's a lot of work that needs to be done to improve the image of a drink long associated with Renaissance fairs and medieval re-enactments. ""I think our number one challenge as an industry is awareness of what mead is,"" says Mr Alexander. ""You ask 10 people in a room if they've ever heard of mead, and two of them might say, 'yes', and only one of them has had a very positive experience."" The mead of the past was often sweet, and didn't appeal to many drinkers",1,4,3

Freezing care provider fees to save money was no long sustainable, it said. Ministers say extra money will help NHS and social care services work together. The survey, which was completed by 147 directors of adult social services for councils in England, suggests that funding reductions to social care budgets have totalled £4.6bn since 2010 - a 31% overall reduction. Budgets for adult social care - which provides practical support to people due to illness, disability, old age or a low income - will reduce by a further £500m in cash terms this year, it said. ""Taking the growth in numbers of older and disabled people into account, this means that an additional £1.1bn would be needed to provide the same level of service as last year,"" the report warned. It said some councils had made savings in the past by freezing fees paid to providers, but care providers were now also facing financial problems. Some companies - particularly those in southern England - are struggling to attract staff, amid increasing concern about the quality of care, it said. ""What is at stake is the continuing capacity of adult social care to sustain services to those in greatest need,"" ADASS president Ray James said. ""In virtually all our authorities, the number in need is growing, while the complexity of their needs is increasing."" ADASS called for the government to ""protect essential care and support services to the most vulnerable members of our community"". But a government spokesman said the survey ""ignores"" a commitment to invest £10bn in health services that are being ""joined up"" with social care, by 2020. The BBC has launched an online guide to the care system for the over-65s. The ""care calculator"" covers residential care and the support provided in people's own homes, for tasks such as washing and dressing. Users can submit their postcode and find out how much each service costs where they live in the UK. There is also a dedicated BBC Cost of Care website, with news stories, analysis and video. The spokesman said: ""Increasing budgets isn't the only solution. By working innovatively and joining up health and social care we can improve care and also save money."" However, Councillor Izzi Seccombe, from the Local Government Association (LGA), said adult social care services were facing ""enormous pressures"" due to ""insufficient funding, growing demand and escalating costs"". ""We have long warned that investing in the NHS whilst social care budgets are under continual pressure is simply a false economy. ""It is social care services that support elderly and vulnerable people to maintain their independence, live in their own community and stay out of hospital longer,"" she added.

openai_text-ada-001,Firms have been struggling to meet demand in the manufacturing sector because of soft domestic demand and EU referendum uncertainty.,"The Markit/CIPS manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index fell to 49.2 from 50.7 in March. A reading below 50 indicates falling output. It is the first time that activity in the sector has fallen since March 2013. Firms blamed soft domestic demand, a fall in new business from overseas and uncertainty ahead of the EU referendum. A slowdown in the oil and gas industry, a major customer for UK companies, is also hitting production. The index for new orders fell to 50.4 in April, from 51.9 the month before, matching February's three-year low. Rob Dobson, senior economist at Markit, said: ""On this evidence manufacturing production is now falling at a quarterly pace of around 1%, and will likely act as a drag on the economy again during the second quarter and putting greater pressure on the service sector to sustain GDP growth. ""The manufacturing labour market is also being impacted, with the data signalling close to 20,000 job losses over the past three months."" Last week, official figures showed UK economic growth slowed to 0.4% in the first quarter of the year from 0.6% in late 2015, propped up by the services sector. David Noble, group chief executive at the Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply (CIPS), said: ""Recent fears over a stall in the UK's manufacturing sector have now become a reality. ""An atmosphere of deep unease is building throughout the manufacturing supply chain, eating away at new orders, reducing British exports and putting more jobs at risk. ""A sense of apprehension across the sector is being caused by enduring volatility in the oil and gas industry, falling retailer confidence and the uncertainty created by the EU referendum."" The Markit/CIPS survey found new export orders contracted for the fourth straight month in April as the global economy continued to slow. A measure of employment in the manufacturing sector was also below the 50 mark for its fourth straight month. Lee Hopley, chief economist at the manufacturers' organisation, EEF, said: ""The sharp drop to a three-year low and another month of reported job cuts could be the clearest sign yet that referendum uncertainty is starting to weigh on the real economy. ""However, this is just another straw on the back of a sector already grappling with the struggling oil and gas sector, softening domestic demand and weak order outlook from other parts of the world, all of which are failing to provide any counterbalance to the political uncertainty at home.""",1,4,3

Appointments affected include scans and consultations with specialists - including those for cancer patients. The British Medical Association said such incentives were ""misguided"". At least nine clinical commissioning groups (CCGs) were offering GP practices payments for hitting targets, according to Pulse's investigation. In one case, Birmingham South Central CCG was offering practices more than Â£11,000 to reduce new outpatient attendances, follow-ups, A&E attendances and emergency admissions by 1%, compared with 2014/15. It said the schemes, which exclude cancer referrals, were designed to ""incentivise best quality practice"" and ""drive improvements in the quality of primary medical care"". ""Our priority is to ensure that patients have access to services that they need, when they need them,"" said a spokesperson for Birmingham South Central CCG. Another CCG told Pulse it had considered the ""full impact"" of the incentive scheme and was ""confident that there is no conflict of interest"". Pulse said that one scheme had already been looked at by the General Medical Council, the body which regulates medical standards in the UK, after local GP leaders expressed their concern. The magazine pointed out that initial hospital referrals for cancer patients should happen within two weeks of a GP first suspecting the condition. Dr Chand Nagpaul, chairman of the GPs committee of the doctors' trade union the British Medical Association, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that such schemes were a ""financial contaminant"" to patient-doctor trust. He said: ""It's short-sighted and misguided of CCGs to introduce such mechanisms, because they do lead to the potential for patients questioning the motives of GP referrals. ""We believe it is far more appropriate for CCGs to introduce clinical pathways that ensure patients are referred appropriately rather than these crude, salesman-like bonuses which pay GPs simply to make reduction to referrals in numerical terms."" Dr Peter Melton is local GP and clinical chief officer for North East Lincolnshire CCG, which offers the equivalent of more than Â£6,000 to practices that reduce outpatient referrals to the same level as the 25% with the lowest referral rates (which include two-week urgent cancer referrals) in 2014/15. He said the CCG was already among the best in England for referring suspected cancer patients to a consultant within two weeks and the scheme was not about avoiding sending people to hospital. ""It is not focussing on referral reduction per se but on better clinical and quality standards for the patient,"" he explained. ""The expectation is practices will be encouraged to investigate more locally and monitor the patient in the first instance rather than automatically refer in to a secondary care service."" Analysis by the BBC's Helen Briggs The NHS is under pressure to make savings, with a target of carving out Â£22bn of efficiency savings by 2020.

""We were [rehearsing] in the tent for about a week and a half, then we had to move to bigger studios in Hollywood where we are working on the rest of the show,"" she told Houston radio station Mix 96.5. ""And then we will send that equipment to Houston where we will finish rehearsals. Fans can expect a performance that spans my career so far."" She has a high standard to live up to - notably Prince's show in 2007, which took place in the middle of a Miami thunderstorm and is widely accepted as the greatest performance in the event's history, if not Prince's career. Here are some of the other most memorable - and surprising - moments from the last 30 years. Super Bowl performers get a very strict 12-minute time limit, so most performers cram their set with as much music as possible. Not Michael Jackson. After shooting onto the stage at the Pasadena Rose Bowl, he stood completely still, staring at the world for a full 90 seconds. Ninety. It was a master class in ratcheting expectation to a fever pitch. And the screams when he launched into Jam (not one of his best songs) proved he knew what he was doing. Brilliantly, Jackson staged this entire performance while wearing a jacket it looked like he'd borrowed from Muammar Gaddafi. Beat that, Gaga. Baby, he was born to run... and slide on his knees... and crotch slam a TV camera. In his autobiography, The Boss explains the incident like this: ""Too much adrenalin, a late drop, too much speed, here I come, Mikeâ€¦ BOOM! ""And I'm onto his camera, the lens implanted into my chest with one leg off the stage. I use his camera to push myself back up andâ€¦ BLAM! BORN TO RUN!"" It led to the memorable headline: ""America Attacked by Bruce Springsteen's crotch"" - but it didn't stop the star delivering one of the most powerful and energetic Super Bowl shows in recent history. Even if they were fined for over-running by 40 seconds. Coldplay were the headline act at last year's Super Bowl in Santa Clara - but someone forgot to tell Beyonce. She only performed one song, Formation, underscoring its message of black pride and power with back-up dancers dressed in leather body suits and black berets reminiscent of the Black Panthers movement. Some of her dancers were even pictured holding up a sign declaring ""Justice 4 Mario Woods"" - a 26-year-old black man who was shot dead by armed police in San Francisco two months earlier. The performance heralded the arrival of her unapologetically political album, Lemonade, later in the year.

openai_text-ada-001,Gardaí have found a man whoicolor dog fouling case never happened.,"Asghar Buksh, 55, repeatedly struck mother-of-six Nasreen Buksh over the head with a heavy blunt object which has never been found. He admitted culpable homicide on the basis of diminished responsibility after saying he had no recollection of the killing at Dixon Avenue, Glasgow, on 24 September last year. Buksh will be sentenced on 27 June. The High Court in Glasgow heard that 43-year-old Mrs Buksh died after being struck on the head at least five times. Pathologists told the court that the lack of defensive injuries and the position of her body suggested she was assaulted as she slept. Following the attack, Buksh went to Cathcart Police Station and told an officer: ""I've come to hand myself in. I think my wife's dead. I hit her on the head. I did it."" The court was told that three psychiatrists described Buksh as suffering from an acute stress disorder at the time. Prosecutor Gordon Lamont said: ""The accused and his wife had been married for 25 years, but over the last 10 or 11 years their relationship appears to have broken down and they became increasingly estranged, albeit, still residing under the one roof. ""They slept separately and Mrs Buksh routinely slept on the sofa in the living room. Their children report that they barely spoke to each other."" Mr Lamont said the problems in the marriage intensified after Mrs Buksh went to Pakistan on holiday in May last year. He said she had become involved with another man and was making plans to move to Pakistan. The court also heard that two days before he killed his wife, Buksh went to Paisley Police Office and spoke with a support officer saying he feared his wife was going to take their youngest child, aged 10, to Pakistan and not return. He also made an emergency doctor's appointment and said he was suffering from stress and not sleeping. He was prescribed medication for stress. Defence counsel Sarah Livingstone said: ""My client has no memory of this incident. His amnesia is absolutely genuine. ""This is not a case where this man was a bad husband, there was no domestic abuse. This was an unhappy marriage, but however, unhappy it was it didn't justify killing his wife. ""He suffered an acute stress reaction. Three psychiatrists all agree that he was suffering from an abnormality of the mind."" Judge Lord Burns deferred sentence on Buksh until 27 June at the High Court in Edinburgh for background reports.",0,1,1
openai_text-ada-001,Golfers at Dundee's public courses have been banned from bringing their dogs with them after complaints from fellow players and staff.,"BHS entered administration in April. Since then, efforts have been continuing to rescue it from closure and save the jobs of its 11,000 staff. Last week, a surprise late bid led by retail veteran Greg Tufnell transformed the race to acquire the retailer. His team, said to be backed by Portuguese money, is the front-runner. But if a deal cannot be struck, the business may still have to be liquidated. The remaining bidders have faded into the background. Another consortium led by Matalan tycoon John Hargreaves and Turkish retail entrepreneur Cafer Mahiroglu has reportedly run into difficulties, while other suitors have apparently failed to impress with their proposals. Some of those involved in the different bids have impressive retailing histories. But then Sir Philip Green, who controlled BHS from 2000 to 2015, also had a brilliant track record. And he ended up selling the business for Â£1. So what are the chances of saving BHS from the liquidators? And just who are the people aiming to do it? In the public eye, Greg Tufnell is easily overshadowed by his more famous brother Phil, the former England cricketer. But that could change if his bid for BHS is successful, because he hopes to become the firm's next chairman. And as far as his credentials for the job are concerned, the 54-year-old executive certainly talks the talk. He describes himself as ""a highly experienced managing director with Mothercare and Arcadia, a blend of entrepreneur, strategist and hands-on operator with significant commercial business turnaround, acquisition and fund-raising experience"". His record shows that he was buying and merchandising director at Next from 1991 to 1994. He then spent three years as managing director of menswear retailer Burton, part of the Arcadia group, followed by another three years as managing director of Mothercare. He currently appears to occupy a portfolio of different jobs, including the chairmanships of leather accessories brand Zatchels and recruitment consultancy hga Group. Earlier this month, he registered a new firm, Richess Group, at Companies House. Its other directors are Nick de Scossa, a Swiss banker, and Lisbon-based entrepreneur Jose Maria Soares Bento. Until Mr Tufnell's bid turned up, many observers had assumed that BHS would be snapped up by Matalan founder Mr Hargreaves. But it appears that the cost of a deal may have proved too high. Sources say Mr Hargreaves was asked to improve his offer and balked. Like Sir Philip Green, 71-year-old John Hargreaves also enjoys the life of the super-rich. He has an estimated fortune of Â£1bn, according to the Sunday Times Rich List. But in stark contrast to the ebullient Sir Philip, Mr Hargreaves is described by industry insiders as quiet-spoken, someone who shuns the limelight. Mr Hargreaves is no longer directly involved in the business he founded. He sold his 69% stake in Matalan in 2000, then in 2006 took it private through Missouri Bidco, a company 53.5% owned by him and his family. As a partner in Mr Hargreaves' bid, there is also Cafer Mahiroglu, the owner of Select Fashions. At 50, he is the youngest of",0,3,2

Mr Booth said: ""With regard to the accident, we have embarked on a very comprehensive analysis of what happened and this work continues for the moment.""

openai_text-ada-001,Gulf ofcommunications has ordered returning officers to deliver paper copies of the Tallies to the counting centre in the capital.,"Returning officers were ordered to physically deliver paper copies of their constituency's tallies to the counting centre in the capital. Election officials have urged patience. Uhuru Kenyatta, who faces trial at the International Criminal Court, has been leading in early presidential results declared from Monday's tightly contested election. He is due to stand trial at The Hague next month for allegedly fuelling violence after the disputed 2007 election. He denies the charge. His closest rival is outgoing Prime Minister Raila Odinga. With provisional results in from more than 40% of polling stations earlier on Wednesday, Mr Odinga had 42% of the vote compared with Mr Kenyatta's 53%. However, Mr Odinga's allies remain confident that he will gain ground as results from his strongholds, including the Coast Province, are declared. More than 1,000 people were killed in the violence which broke out in 2007-08 after Mr Odinga claimed he had been cheated of victory by supporters of President Mwai Kibaki, who is stepping down after two terms in office. The BBC's Solomon Mugera in the capital, Nairobi, says Kenyans are becoming increasingly anxious about the delay in finalising the results. Some businesses and schools across the country have remained shut since Monday's election, he says. This has led to a shortage of goods, pushing up the prices of basic foodstuff in areas such as Kibera, the biggest slum in Nairobi and a stronghold of Mr Odinga, our correspondent adds. Uhuru Kenyatta Raila Odinga Profile: Uhuru Kenyatta Profile: Raila Odinga Some electoral officials have had to drive hundreds of kilometres to the counting centre in Nairobi to deliver paper copies of the tally of their returns. At about 13:00 local time, returning officers from only 53 of the 290 constituencies had arrived and the election commission said it would announce results from constituencies as they were ready. Its website had stopped giving updated results from the presidential race on Wednesday, and was still showing figures from Tuesday night. Our correspondent says the large number of spoiled ballots - about 6% of the total vote, well over double the number of votes cast for the third-placed candidate, Musailia Mudavadi - has become a major bone of contention. Mr Odinga's Coalition of Reforms and Democracy (Cord) wants them to be counted, but Mr Kenyatta's Jubilee Coalition is resisting this. Late on Tuesday, the election commission announced that the spoiled ballots would count in the overall vote total, increasing the likelihood of a run-off between the top two candidates, news agencies report. Mr Kenyatta's running mate William Ruto, who is also facing a trial at the ICC, said foreign embassies may have influenced such a decision. ""We want to believe that this is not an attempt to deny the Jubilee Coalition a first-round victory as is clearly now on the wall,"" he is quoted by Reuters news agency as saying. But the election commission now says a decision on what to do about the spoiled ballots will be taken after all other votes are counted, our correspondent reports.

openai_text-ada-001,"Hibs are ready to be guided forward, not waiting to be rescued.","His previous jobs were at Celtic and Bolton, but moving to the second tier of Scottish football was no hindrance to him returning to work at Easter Road. Lennon saw the vacancy as an opportunity, and that was enough to encourage Hibs that a figure of his profile and experience would accept a role in the Championship. Even though his last job in Scotland involved leading a team on Champions League duty, Lennon's mind has not been swayed by haughtiness. The appointment of the former Celtic manager as successor to Alan Stubbs suits both parties, because it is mutually beneficial. Success is alluring, and Hibs offer Lennon the chance to accumulate more achievements. He was immediately engaged in crisis management at his previous club Bolton, but will find stability, potential and accomplishment at Easter Road. The demand will be to deliver promotion, but that will not seem daunting when the majority of the squad that pushed Rangers for a while last season then won the Scottish Cup is still in place. Lennon's task is to refine and bolster the team, when new managers are often faced with a period of overhaul. Stubbs left the club on an emotional high after delivering their first Scottish Cup in 114 years, but before the final against Rangers there was a tangible sense of exasperation that promotion had been missed. Hibs were entitled to feel that it was an unnecessary failure given their circumstances. The club is about to embark on a third season in the Championship, but by most other measures they can be considered a top-flight outfit. The budget will be significantly more than the rest of the teams in the division, the training ground at East Mains and facilities are first-class, the football side of the business is stable and well-run by George Craig, the club's head of football operations, the squad is full of talent. Lennon can rely on consistently assured performances from the likes of David Gray, Darren McGregor, Paul Hanlon, Lewis Stevenson, John McGinn, Fraser Fyvie, Dylan McGeouch, James Keatings and Jason Cummings. Some minor issues remain, such as who will fill the goal next season, but the challenge is more on adding depth and strength of will to the squad and man-management. McGinn, one of the most reliably effective players in the Championship last season, has already insisted that he remains committed to Hibs despite the failure to achieve promotion. The 21-year-old midfielder provides the kind of industry and spirit that a team can be built around. There may be critical decisions to make, though, since Cummings is entering the final year of his contract and so represents a sellable asset. He is a regular goalscorer, though, and Stubbs had to sign Anthony Stokes on loan last January to provide some support up front. These are tweaks compared to the amount of work Stubbs had to carry out when he was appointed two years ago. Hibs are ready to be guided forward, not waiting to be rescued.

openai_text-ada-001,Hollywood has created a movie about a white woman who was never able to write another book and her friend who is now retired says she told her friend Harper Lee about why she didn't write anything else.,"Harper Lee's classic was published 50 years ago this summer and it remains the only novel she ever wrote. Lee, 84, has never explained why she stopped writing. She doesn't give interviews - ""Hell, no"" was her response to a request several decades ago - and that silence has only added to the intrigue. But her close friend Thomas Lane Butts, a retired minister in her hometown, Monroeville, Alabama, says she once told him the reason. Sitting on a pew in the Methodist church which the Lee family still attends, he described to me how she suddenly brought the subject up one night over dinner in New York. ""She asked me, 'You ever wonder why I didn't write anything else?' And I said, 'Along with several million other people, yes, I had wondered about that.' And she said, 'Well, what do you think?'"" Speaking in his slow southern drawl, the Rev Butts, who just turned 80, suggested to her that she had already written a great book and therefore didn't need to compete with herself. ""And when I got through she said, 'You're all wrong.' I said, 'Alright, smart Alec. You tell me.' She said, 'I would not go through all the deprivation of privacy through which I went for this book again for any amount of money.' ""And she said, 'I did not need to write another book. I said what I wanted to say in that book.'"" Harper Lee called it a simple tale about the ""conflict of the human soul"" and Monroeville, Alabama, is where she drew her inspiration. The story depicts the segregated South of her childhood, during the Depression. It was published at the height of the civil rights struggle. The Rev Butts grew up 10 miles outside Monroeville. By the late 1950s, he says, he was a ""fuzzy-cheeked young preacher"" campaigning for an end to segregation. He had met Martin Luther King Jr and signed a petition to boycott buses. The Ku Klux Klan had left a burning cross on his front lawn. He says To Kill a Mockingbird was not well received in Monroeville when it was published. ""The people who were hard racist did not like it because of the implication of the book,"" the Rev Butts told me. ""The book revealed racism and that always frightens a racist - when you pull the cover off them. ""Those of us who stood up for civil rights were much encouraged by the book because in a very skilful and subtle way it addressed itself for justice."" But these days, the Rev Butts says, there is enormous civic pride in Monroeville. The old courthouse, which Hollywood re-created for the film, now houses a museum to Harper Lee and the town's other literary icon, Truman Capote. Capote was a childhood friend of hers and is thought to be the inspiration for the Dill character in To Kill a Mockingbird. The town's residents often try to protect Lee, allowing her to live a normal life instead of being hounded by fans or bothered with prying questions. ""Being famous",0,3,1

That is down from 6.1% in the previous quarter. Analysts were expecting the same figure for January to March. India is the third-largest economy in Asia but has been struggling with inflation and currency weakness. Since July last year, the Indian rupee has seen one of the biggest declines among Asian currencies, dropping more than 27% against the US dollar. ""Shocking numbers as growth was even lower than lows witnessed during the financial crisis,"" said Anubhuti Sahay from Standard Chartered Bank in Mumbai. The BBC's Yogita Limaye in Mumbai said that just a year ago India was aspiring for double-digit growth. But a global slowdown has reduced external demand, and high inflation coupled with a weak rupee has made things more expensive within the country. Domestic demand, which India's economy is largely reliant on, has also slowed in part due to the political upheaval in the country. India's economy is suffering from ""policy incoherence, shifting global risk appetite and a comatose government"", said Rajeev Malik, senior economist at brokerage CLSA India's Prime Minister Manmohan Singh admitted early this month that his government must do more to get the once fast-growing economy moving again.

openai_text-ada-001,Inverness CT manager Richie Foran is speaking about how the team is deep in trouble after their captain was shown a red card and their striker was sent off.,"Steven Maclean bundled home the opener five minutes before half-time. The hosts, slacker after the break, had beleaguered striker Larnell Cole sent-off after he confronted the referee. Liam Craig sealed the win from the penalty spot with two minutes to play, before Graham Cummins finished a sumptuous stoppage-time move. And things got worse still for Caley Thistle after the match, with captain Gary Warren shown a red card in the tunnel. Saints remain five points clear of Hearts in fourth place, and closed the gap on third-placed Rangers, who play Aberdeen on Sunday, to three points. With game after game ticking past, Inverness' position looks increasingly perilous. Next weekend's trip to Motherwell, second-bottom on goal difference, is now seismic. This contest turned nightmarish for the hosts after a bright opening, but the truth is, given their predicament, Caley Thistle did not threaten St Johnstone's goal enough. Billy Mckay sent a shot over from close range. Alex Fisher nodded a diving header wide. Carl Tremarco miscued a volley. Greg Tansey did draw a save from Alan Mannus when he rasped in an effort from outside the box, but Richie Foran's side never looked likely to find the net. Their best opportunity came immediately after the Saints went ahead, when Tansey fed Cole, who seemed to panic in a terrific position and shot straight at Mannus. Cole's dismissal ended the contest when he appeared to be cautioned twice for challenging referee Stephen Finnie's decision not to award a foul. St Johnstone were merciless and could have had more. With just one win from their last 21 league games, Inverness look deep in trouble. Tommy Wright's side deserve so much credit. Saints were tactically brilliant, so strong defensively and ruthlessly capitalised on their man advantage. They took one of their few first-half chances when Michael Coulson broke down the left and sent a dangerous ball across the six-yard box. Owain Fon Williams could only parry into the danger area, Cummins' shot was blocked but Maclean followed up to force it home. They should have had another when Craig's superb curling corner flew all the way to the back post where Cummins slid in and somehow knocked it over from two yards. Craig, in his 300th appearance for the club, coolly converted a spot-kick after Cummins was tripped to seal the points. Cummins then slammed home after Miller danced around the area to tee him up, before Craig cracked the bar amid the late flurry. With a tendency to finish the season strongly, and just a three-point gap to Rangers, the Perth side look capable of something special this term. Inverness CT manager Richie Foran: ""It is a tough time of the season to be sitting bottom, and I need real men to stand up to that, but not enough of them did that today. ""It is pure luck we are still in it and it is only four points. I sound like a broken record but one win changes it - that is the truth. But I need braver players with more passion and desire.",1,5,4

The system would appoint a named person - usually a teacher or health visitor - to ensure the wellbeing of every child. But judges at the UK's highest court ruled against the scheme in July 2016, citing concerns over information sharing. The Supreme Court judges said some proposals breached rights to privacy and a family life under the European Convention on Human Rights. However, the court said the aim of the Act, which is intended to promote and safeguard the rights and wellbeing of children and young people, was legitimate. Speaking ahead of his statement to the Scottish Parliament, Mr Swinney said the Scottish government remained ""absolutely committed"" to the Named Person service as a way to support children and their families. ""Last year the Supreme Court ruled definitively that the intention of providing a Named Person for every child to promote and safeguard their wellbeing was 'unquestionably legitimate and benign',"" he said. ""Their judgement did, however, require us to change the provisions relating to information sharing. ""Since the judgement, we have undertaken an intensive period of engagement with children, young people, parents, carers, practitioners and professionals. ""I will now update parliament on the next steps in this vital means of supporting, safeguarding and promoting the wellbeing of our children and young people."" The judges said in July that specific proposals about information-sharing were ""not within the legislative competence of the Scottish Parliament"". And they said the legislation made it ""perfectly possible"" that confidential information about a young person could be disclosed to a ""wide range of public authorities without either the child or young person or her parents being aware"". The appeal was brought by the No to Named Persons (NO2NP) coalition, which includes the Christian Institute, Care (Christian Action Research and Education), Tyme Trust and the Family Education Trust.

In the latest report, inspectors said the curriculum at Phoenix Academy was ""inadequate"", while ""weak teaching"" meant pupils were not sufficiently challenged and were often ""disengaged and disruptive"". There was particular criticism of standards in English and maths which the watchdog said were limiting pupils' achievements in other areas.

Morocco controls two-thirds of Western Sahara and sees it as part of its historic territory. However some, including the UN, see Western Sahara as Africa's last colony. Africa Live: More on this and other stories Find out more about Western Sahara A referendum was promised in 1991 but never carried out due to wrangling over who was eligible to vote. Thousands of Sahrawi refugees still live in refugee camps in Algeria - some have been there for 40 years. It is not clear what happens next but Western Sahara is hopeful that a committee set up by the AU will address the issues that both sides have raised. Some AU delegates said that it would be easier to resolve the issue with Morocco inside the AU. Sidi Mohammed, a Western Sahara official, told the BBC that Morocco's return to the AU means that it would now be expected to put ""in practice decisions taken by the AU with regard to a referendum in Western Sahara"". Mr Mohammed dismissed the suggestion that Morocco would now seek to get the AU to change its position, saying that the no country could unilaterally change the AU fundamental agreement, saying it opposed colonisation. In his speech at the AU summit, King Mohammed VI of Morocco said the readmission was not meant to divide the continental body. No. Algeria has always been a big supporter of Western Sahara's Polisario Front and it had wanted Morocco to accept independence of the territory as a condition for readmission. Zimbabwe and South Africa were also supportive of this stance but they were outnumbered by those who wanted Morocco back in the fold. There is no specific provision in the AU charter that bars any country from joining it. Morocco simply applied and the request was accepted by more than two-thirds of the 53 members. Morocco has been involved in intense lobbying and applied in July last year to rejoin the continental body. King Mohammed toured various African countries seeking support for the bid. No. While culturally the country's identity aligns with Arab states, its economic interests increasingly lie in Africa. This is a strategic move to continue exploring its interests in mining, construction, medical, insurance and banking sectors on the continent.

Pakistan skipper Misbah ul-Haq - who had played with restraint for his 51 - inexplicably aimed an uncharacteristic slog at Moeen and was bowled. Moeen then removed Wahab Riaz caught behind, before Rashid claimed the final three wickets - all superbly caught at first slip by James Anderson. England sensed an unlikely victory, but their reorganised batting order could not score quickly enough as Pakistan's tactic of spin from both ends and fielders on the boundary brought them regular wickets. Makeshift opener Buttler was trapped lbw for four, Moeen and Stokes were caught on the boundary in quick succession, and Jonny Bairstow was stumped attempting a big shot. However, in truth it was mistakes earlier in the match that ultimately proved more costly as England fell just short of their first win on the subcontinent since beating India in Kolkata in 2012. In Pakistan's first innings, Ian Bell dropped Mohammad Hafeez (98) and Shafiq (107) at slip early in their innings. And Shoaib Malik, who made 245, was dismissed off a no-ball by Stuart Broad. England captain Alastair Cook, whose record-breaking 263 in the first innings was ultimately in vain, admitted England were frustrated to come so close to victory. ""We'd have liked another three or four overs at the end but that's the way it goes,"" he said. ""I can't fault the guys for hanging in there on that wicket. ""The pitch did deteriorate and spun more today which gave us hope, so it's a bit of a bittersweet finish. We knew we had to put the pressure on Pakistan and then on the last day you never know.

I got it like other people on our network. The buzz around it was then created on different social media websites and with videos. I was here on 25 January when riot police forced us out and by the 28th, we were back following the violence. I've been sleeping here most of the time since. Our social network was established in 2005, when there was a democratic opening around the time of the presidential elections. People from different backgrounds all met through blogging and hoped to use technology for social change. It meant we have all gained good contacts, experience and strong networks. I like to think the social network is the people itself. Things like Facebook, Twitter, SMS and phones are just social tools. When they blocked Facebook and shut down technology, our network still operated because it's about people. Internet activists are also people and a lot of our organising, social work and relationships are developed offline. This is something that people dreamt of but didn't anticipate happening in reality. If anything, it shows that all the effort we put in over the past few years has not been wasted. It has climaxed into this critical mass of people you see in the square. At the moment I'm not getting a lot of internet connection. I'm trying not to drain my phone battery. We're still using it to distribute footage people are bringing to us that we've sorted through. I hope the internet will continue to play a complementary role in activism. At the moment we physically exist in downtown Cairo and I hope that when we have finished this sit-in, we will have won the right to organise ourselves outside the internet. Twitter: Amr Gharbeia I was involved in this revolution from the first day, 25 January, and I've now been spending my nights here for a while. For the past five years, I was very active online, blogging and tweeting. As we live under emergency laws in Egypt it has been very difficult to meet or communicate except on the internet. I'd never been part of a demonstration on the ground. At first we were mocking the event on 25 January. We questioned whether it was really possible to have a ""Facebook revolution"". I came on the 25th because I felt it was my duty as a citizen and I couldn't believe how it turned into something so different from what we've seen before. I was walking among the people and weeping. Now I sometimes just tweet to update people about what's going on or to call for a million-man demonstration or a day to remember our martyrs. I'm well-known among bloggers for my long articles and constant tweets, but once I was here I stopped communicating this way so much. I felt it was totally different to have real freedom rather than just hypothetical freedom or internet freedom. Blogging and tweeting has been important as we were building our minds.

openai_text-ada-001,Public authorities in Russia have banned websites that make fun of the Kremlin because they contain pornography.,"Internet service providers had until Tuesday to implement the ban. The sites now redirect to a message explaining they have been blocked ""by decision of public authorities"". In 2015, the authorities banned 11 popular pornography websites, saying many failed to protect children ""from information harmful to their health"". Analysis by Vitaliy Shevchenko, BBC Monitoring The decision was made following two separate court rulings, which said the websites ""spread pornography"". Sexually explicit content is not outlawed in Russia, but the law bans ""the illegal production, dissemination and advertisement of pornographic materials and objects"". It is not uncommon for Russia to ban websites. The government agency Roskomnadzor maintains a blacklist that now includes thousands of them. Access is usually blocked for violating the notoriously vague extremism legislation or child protection laws. Websites critical of the Kremlin have been blocked too, and at one point Wikipedia was blacklisted. Following the 2015 ban, one woman asked Roskomnadzor on Twitter whether it could recommend an alternative. The agency replied: ""You can meet someone in real life."" On Tuesday, it said its earlier tweet was ""still relevant"". However, open rights campaigners have warned that local bans can be defeated. ""Blocking porn is the fastest way to ensure widespread adoption of censorship circumvention in your country,"" said Eva Galperin, global policy analyst at the Electronic Frontier Foundation. One of the affected porn sites offered Roskomnadzor a premium subscription to its service, in exchange for lifting the ban. The government agency said it was ""not in the market"" for such an offer.

Senior coroner John Leckey is retiring this year and told a preliminary hearing of the inquest in Belfast that no replacement has been appointed. His retirement could leave only one coroner in Northern Ireland. Kingsmill is among dozens of inquests dating from the early days of the Troubles that face delay because not enough money is available to investigate or there is nobody to oversee fresh hearings. Mr Leckey said: ""I feel for the bereaved families, not exclusively Kingsmill but for other inquests I am involved in. ""It is a disappointment that is widespread."" A lawyer for some of the Kingsmill victims' families said they would be pressing Stormont's justice department for more resources to allow an inquest to go ahead. Karen Armstrong, a sister of one of the murdered men, said the lack of resources was ""a political problem"". ""We are not going to lie down and accept it,"" she said. ""We will fight until we get another date and they have to make sure there are enough coroners in Northern Ireland to deal with our and many other cases."" Ulster Unionist MLA Danny Kennedy said he would be asking Justice Minister David Ford to ensure the matter was referred to the relevant authorities so that ""action can be taken as soon as possible"". ""Justice has been denied for almost 40 years and it is totally unacceptable that this inquest should be delayed further due to the unavailability of a coroner,"" he said.

openai_text-ada-001,"Ricky Burns has won three world titles at three weights, including a victory over Italy's Michele Di Rocco.","With three defeats in his previous six bouts, the Scottish boxer's career seemed to be on the wane. But his power, timing and focus returned in a supremely confident display at Glasgow's Hydro on Saturday night as he clinched the vacant WBA World Super-Lightweight title - and entered the record books as the first Scot to win world titles at three weights. Italy's Michele Di Rocco, at 34 a year older than Burns, hadn't lost a fight since September 2007. He arrived with a record of 40 wins and a draw from 42 bouts. He left a lesser figure. The referee deemed the man from Assisi to be in no state to continue in the eighth round, the result of a welter of blows to his head and body and made all the more unbearable by the hostile acoustic energy generated by 8,000 Scottish fans. Surely, for Burns, this was time to shout about his record, the ideal moment to counter all those who had written him off and questioned the wisdom of him leaving trainer Billy Nelson two years ago to work with Tony Sim in Essex? No. Instead, the champion spoke of his disbelief at the ease of his victory, his gratitude that he was safe, of his thanks to promoter Eddie Hearn, manager Alex Morrison and coach Sim for believing in him, and of his desire to celebrate with a fast-food burger and 20 chicken nuggets. ""When I got in the ring after the fight, I said, 'You've done it! You've done it!',"" reported a beaming Hearn at the post-fight media conference. ""And you know what Ricky said? 'Can you get a picture with me and Michael Buffer [the legendary American boxing ring announcer]?'"" When he has time to reflect during a well-earned holiday, Burns will take immense satisfaction at being only the third British-born fighter, after Bob Fitzsimmons and Duke McKenzie, to be a three-weight world champion. In Scottish terms, his achievements must mean that he is in the very top tier of boxing greats, comfortably mentioned in the same breath as former world champions Benny Lynch, Walter McGowan, Jackie Paterson, Ken Buchanan and Jim Watt, for example. Burns' record stands at 40 wins from 46 bouts. Remarkably, 11 of those have been world title fights. Buchanan's exploits in the United States add lustre to his legacy, but while Burns may never have fought someone like Roberto Duran, should Hearn manage to set up a bout against Cincinnati's Adrien Broner, the four-time world champion stripped of the WBA title because he could not make the weight, then Burns could achieve little more in the sport. ""There are some big fights out there for me,"" said Burns. ""I want to fight the top names. I will fight anybody. I do super-lightweight comfortably and lightweight is still an option. I would fight Terence Crawford again if it came down to it. ""That's nearly two years I have been with Tony and things have just started clicking.

openai_text-ada-001,Ruskin College is planning to reduce its six BA programmes and three MA courses to save money.,"It comes after Ruskin College's governing body agreed to cut two of its six BA programmes and one of its three MA courses to save money. College principal Chris Wilkes said the decision was related to ""low student numbers rather than any other reason"". He said it would continue to focus on adult education. Famous Ruskin College alumni include former deputy prime minister John Prescott and Dennis Skinner, MP for Bolsover in Derbyshire. BA English Studies, BA History with Social Sciences and MA Women's Studies are being discontinued. Anne Hughes, 63, from Thame in Oxfordshire, has been studying BA English Studies part-time at the college for two years. She said she was ""absolutely distraught"" it was being cut. She is physically disabled and has depression, and said she chose to study at the college because it worked with ""disadvantaged, disabled and mature students"". The college also offers bespoke timetables, unlike some other places of higher education, she added. Online petitions have been set up in a bid to save the English faculty and the Women's Studies course. One signatory, Jenny Lewis, wrote on the first petition: ""[Tutors] Helen Kidd and Tom Sherry are carrying on the great Ruskin tradition of bringing opportunities to those that otherwise would not have them."" Student and activist Saskia Ritchie, who set up the second petition, said Ruskin had been set up for ""people who would traditionally be excluded from academia"" and gives ""access to truly excellent learning opportunities"". Mr Wilkes said the college would lose about 25 students as a result of the cuts. He added degrees had been on offer at the college for about 10 years and were ""relatively new"" considering the college's 116-year history. ""Our focus will continue to be on educating adults and I think what we're doing is just renewing our offer but doing it in a different way, fulfilling our mission in a different way, to perhaps how we've done it in the past,"" Mr Wilkes added.

Ms Teal was previously arrested for protesting against the tree removals. Charges against her and 13 others were dropped earlier this year. More stories from across Yorkshire Sheffield City Council maintain that the removal of street trees in the city is lawful and necessary. A ""pre-action protocol letter"" from the council's legal department to Ms Teal warned the authority will seek a High Court injunction to stop her, and others involved in ""direct action"", from taking part in future protests.

The cuts are being blamed on reduced government spending and a drop in National Lottery ticket sales - a major contributor to sports backing. Governing bodies are bracing themselves for potential job losses. About 60% of funding is made up from Scottish Government money, with lottery sales making up the rest. In the year ending 2015, total revenue was £65.1m, which is divided up and awarded to 52 sports. By the end of next year, that figure will have fallen to £51.8m - a cut to the Scottish sporting budget of 20% in just three years. sportscotland chairman Mel Young said: ""It's heartbreaking to me because I know the effort the sport governing bodies and the community that's around it; the volunteers and the mums and dads. ""And, to have to say that we're having to cut some money back is, I believe, not the right way to go."" Former badminton player Susan Egelstaff, a double bronze medallist at the Commonwealth Games [in 2002 and 2006] and an Olympian, fears the cuts will have ""a huge impact"". ""What that means in the future is that Scotland will be constantly playing catch-up,"" she said. ""It's almost impossible to catch up if you fall too far behind the leading nations."" The Scottish Government said sport and physical activity play a ""key role"" in a healthy Scotland and that ""significant"" investment would continue in those areas. ""Having successfully delivered the Commonwealth Games [in 2014] we are now focusing on protecting or raising investment in areas intended to decrease health inequality and improve life chances, and the small reduction in the sport budget allows us to support those priorities,"" Minister for Sport Aileen Campbell said.

Other performers on Friday included Blondie, who proved so popular it became impossible to enter or leave The Other Stage at lunchtime, and Paolo Nutini, whose soulful ballads were a fitting soundtrack as dusk fell over Somerset. Sophie Ellis-Bextor sneaked some disco into her set at the largely-acoustic Avalon Stage, while the pulsing synthpop of Glaswegian band Chvrches made for a steamy atmosphere in the John Peel tent as fans danced off the downpour. Arcade Fire took to the stage shortly after 22:00 BST, their arrival heralded by a man dressed from head-to-toe in a mirrored suit. Bravely, considering the weather conditions, the 12-piece band were largely dressed in white, but if they were worried about laundry bills, it didn't show. They threw themselves around the stage, thrashing and spinning as though plagued by a swarm of invisible bees, each member switching instruments between - and often during - songs. As well as guitars, they played steel drums, xylophones and even a hurdy gurdy. Frontman Win Butler made frequent excursions into the audience and, during the song Flashbulb Eyes, plucked a camera from a press photographer and carried it on stage to capture the band's performance. The set list was evenly spread across their four albums, with highlights including No Cars Go, Neighborhood #1 (Tunnels) and Rebellion (Lies).

The City Deal scheme will see eight council areas around Glasgow receive about £1bn from the UK and Scottish governments. The councils also have the power to borrow extra cash. The Glasgow and Clyde Valley City Deal involved massive investment by both the Scottish and UK governments last year. Eight councils - Glasgow, East Renfrewshire, Renfrewshire, Inverclyde, North and South Lanarkshire and East and West Dunbartonshire - are involved. The City Deal scheme will see Westminster and Holyrood give £500m each in additional grant funding to the eight council areas. The councils will supplement this by borrowing £130m. Councillors from across all eight areas will meet to discuss some of the schemes. Several of the projects being discussed later are in East Renfrewshire, where £44m is expected to be invested over the next few years, with much of the money coming from the City Deal funding. One is a water sports park at the Dams to Darnley Country Park. It would open in 2017 and include a centre offering wakeboarding, the fastest-growing extreme sport in the world. A new railway station in Barrhead and sliproad from the M77 would serve an area which could become one of East Renfrewshire's fastest growth areas. The council expects 1,000 new homes to be built there. Another project would transform the Levern Works site in Barrhead.

At the party's weekly press briefing, I asked the Welsh Conservative leader Andrew RT Davies, who was elected on the list, whether he'd stand as a constituency candidate in his home turf of the Vale of Glamorgan but he said he hadn't thought about it. Presumably those are the kind of decisions they will now feel more confident contemplating. The party will also have a huge amount of new data on voters which it'll be able to call upon and the belief that campaigning hard on the NHS helped the Tories cross the line in places like the Vale of Clwyd and Gower. The Conservatives feel it's them, rather than any of the other opposition parties, who have become the repository of votes from those who are disaffected by the state of the NHS. Welsh Labour are going to hold a ""short sharp"" analysis into what went wrong. Carwyn Jones was in line with most of the criticism of Ed Miliband when he told AMs that the party needed to appeal to small business owners who are not millionaires but who work hard. What will be more difficult is countering the argument on the NHS, which the former minister Alun Davies believes is already lost. Another potential difficulty for Welsh Labour will be dealing with unhappiness within the party over council re-organisation. Bernie Attridge, the deputy leader of Flintshire Council, has tweeted saying the party needs to be careful on local government reform if it wants to retain the support of grassroots councillors. It also seems to have been the case that Labour lost more votes to UKIP than the Conservatives, which is another challenge to overcome. But Labour will at least have the advantage that it will be David Cameron, and not Ed Miliband, carrying out the latest round of public sector cuts that are likely to take effect sooner rather than later. The question is whether Carwyn Jones is going to be able to turn that to his advantage when his own record in government will be under scrutiny. Plaid Cymru's education spokesman, Simon Thomas, also in the party's weekly press briefing, said he believed Leanne Wood could portray herself as an alternative first minister because of the way she emotionally connected with people in the campaign. The party now has a year to make that a credible proposition after it failed to gain any new seats and came fourth, behind UKIP, in the overall share of the vote, despite her unprecedented profile. He also said that on the campaign trail people wanted to know what Plaid was going to do about the NHS and that people ""did not see the strengths"" of its arguments. The Welsh Liberal Democrats are still licking their wounds but in a ""je ne regrette rien"" moment, the leader Kirsty Williams said she had no regrets over the coalition. She has admitted the party failed to communicate",1,2,3
openai_text-ada-001,The Coronation Fountain has been replaced due to the hosepipe ban.,"The Coronation Fountain, a landmark in Welwyn Garden City, had to be turned off due to the hosepipe ban. However, the council is now paying Â£450 to fill it up again, so that the town looks its best for key 2012 events. It will be working on the 4 and 5 June and when the Olympic torch relay passes through the borough on 8 July. The fountain on Parkway in the town was built to celebrate the Queen's accession to the throne in 1952. It is supplied by an underground tank, but had to be switched off after the water level dropped and could not be refilled. The council is buying water from a landscaping firm which already supplies water from a natural lake source, to maintain the borough's open spaces. It cannot be drunk so is permitted under the hosepipe ban regulations. Council chief executive, Michel Saminaden, said: ""They have told us that there is an abundance of water in this lake so we are probably doing them a favour by taking it."" Mr Saminaden added that the council decided against asking the Veolia water company for a special dispensation. ""I thought that wasn't the right thing to do because we would be using precious water,"" he said. ""What we are doing now is using water that is surplus and we have been told categorically that there is no problem in using it. This is a better all round sustainable solution. ""I am extremely pleased that we have been able to find a solution which will enable everybody to see the fountain in all its glory on the occasion of these two great celebrations.""",0,4,3

It also says they should not ratify a similar deal that has already been done between the EU and Canada. It says some aspects pose a threat to democracy and the rule of law. One of the concerns mentioned in the petition is the idea of tribunals that foreign investors would be able to use in some circumstances to sue governments. There is a great deal of controversy over exactly what this system, known as Investor State Dispute Settlement, would enable companies to do, but campaigners see it as an opportunity for international business to get compensation for government policy changes that adversely affect them. This kind of provision exists in many bilateral trade and investment agreements. Friends of the Earth have published new research on the impact they have had on EU countries. Information about these cases is not always made public, but the group says that going back to 1994, foreign investors have sought compensation of almost €30bn (£24bn) from 20 states. Where the results are known (a small minority of the total), the tribunals have awarded total compensation of €3.5bn (about £2.8bn). In Britain, the possible implications of this provision for the National Health Service have been especially controversial. Campaigners believe that the investor tribunals would make it harder to reverse any decisions to contract services out to international healthcare firms. John Hilary of War on Want said: TTIP ""will make it impossible for any future government to repeal the Health & Social Care Act and bring the NHS back into public hands"". The petition lists a number of other areas where its signatories believes European standards would suffer if the TTIP negotiations are completed and the Canada deal is ratified: employment, social, environmental, privacy and consumer protection. The European Commission says the EU will not have to sacrifice its high standards. It also says investor protection provisions are important for investment flows and have in general worked well. But it accepts there is a need for improvement and is trying to achieve that in its bilateral negotiations. The petition has been organised as an exercise called a European Citizens' Initiative which can lead to a public hearing in the European Parliament and require the European Commission to give a formal response explaining why it is accepting or rejecting what the petitioners call for. The European Commission has already said that the petition doesn't qualify as such an Initiative. Campaigners have launched a legal challenge to this decision.",1,2,3
openai_text-ada-001,The Fostering Network has been working to increase the number of homes where foster carers can live without having to give up their rights to education and health care.,"Research carried out by the Fostering Network suggests almost half of fostered young people are already living with their third foster family since going into care. The group has warned that 750 more foster carers are ""urgently"" needed to meet the demands of the care system. It urged people to ""open their hearts and homes"" to vulnerable youngsters. Currently, more than 5,500 children are in foster care in Scotland, living with 4,400 families and carers. The Fostering Network surveyed 250 children, teenagers and foster carers across Scotland and discovered that many young people had failed to find stability. Almost half were already living with their third family, a quarter were with their fourth family and about 20 were living with their 10th family since going into care. There was a particular need for homes to be found for vulnerable teenagers, siblings and disabled children, the study found. Carla, 23, was taken into care at the age of 12 and had eight foster homes before moving in with the Randalls. ""Looking back now I realised that the Randalls saved my life,"" she said. ""I never understood the extent of the neglect and abuse I had endured until I came to live with a 'normal' loving family. ""They were just always themselves, the smallest details meant so much to me. ""They nurtured a young, angry, untrusting teenager to become a positive, empathetic and successful young woman."" The Fostering Network said instability had a detrimental effect on the child's education and wellbeing, while finding a stable foster carer from the outset could lead to improved relationships and a happier childhood. Sara Lurie, director of the Fostering Network Scotland, said: ""As each year passes, we see more and more children coming into care. ""We need people who can open their heart, and their homes, to vulnerable children and young people and use their skills to help support them to reach their full potential. ""In particular we need people who have the skills, patience and passion to look after teenagers who may have had a really tough time and be facing some real challenges, and to offer them love, stability and security. ""A good foster carer will believe in the ambition of the children in their care in the same way they'd believe in the ambition of their biological family members."" Apologies for the delay, see below as requested. A Scottish government spokeswoman said: ""Giving young people security is paramount and we have done a great deal of work with our partners across local government and the third sector to improve how we intervene early when there is a problem within families to find appropriate solutions quickly. ""We have also expanded the age at which young people can remain in foster care as part of the continuing care provisions and the support available when they transition into independent living.""",1,3,3

The Vatican usually responds within six weeks to approve such a new ambassador. The nomination of Mr Stefanini was seen as a litmus test for Pope Francis, who has taken a more liberal stance on homosexuality. A French government spokesman said there had been negotiations with the Vatican over the appointment. ""France has chosen its ambassador to the Vatican. This choice was Stefanini and that remains the French proposal,"" said spokesman Stephane Le Foll. Observers say most Vatican appointments are confirmed within six weeks and that this long silence should be read as a rejection. The Vatican traditionally makes no statement if it intends to decline a nomination. Mr Stefanini served in the Holy See as a deputy ambassador in the French embassy from 2001 to 2005. He was described by the country's foreign ministry as ""one of our best diplomats"". France legalised same-sex marriage in 2013, despite opposition from the Catholic Church.

openai_text-ada-001,"The Leicestershire County Council has been struggling to keep up with cuts in core funding, which is the source of their problems.","Byron Rhodes is taking me around the modern council headquarters. It's full of light. It's busy. The building has regenerated the area around Melton Mowbray's railway station, once a muddy pot-holed piece of wasteland where those in the know parked for free. Now the council offices link the station to a park and the town centre. It was partly paid for with insurance money after a fire destroyed the old offices on the other side of town. A supermarket moved in to replace it and helped with the money too, putting the council on a firm financial footing. But that was four years ago and the crisis is a different one today. It's being experienced by all local authorities - cuts in central government funding which threaten the services they provide. Mr Rhodes is also deputy leader of Leicestershire County Council, with responsibility for finance. Leicestershire is historically the poorest funded council in the country because of a quirk of Whitehall recalculations, going back a quarter of a century since the poll tax, or community charge, was scrapped. At the moment councils get income from council tax, a share of the business rates, any income they generate themselves from services plus a grant from central government. It's the grant cut which is causing them grief. What's called the ""core funding"" is worked out by the number of homes multiplied by a set amount. And each authority has a different value set per dwelling. If we look at Surrey, which is top of the table, the amount will be £1,686 by 2019/20. Nottinghamshire is mid-table at £1,482, Derbyshire is in the lower reaches with £1,422 per dwelling and then comes Leicestershire at £1,354. ""The funding system is chaotic,"" says Byron Rhodes. ""It doesn't reflect real need. Look at Oxfordshire which is an interesting example,"" he says with a glint in his eye. Could he possibly be referring to the prime ministerial plea to the county council about cutbacks to services there? ""If we had the same funding as Oxfordshire, we'd have £50m a year extra. If we had the same as Surrey, we'd have £100m more. We'd be partying everyday if we had that kind of money."" Leicestershire have been helped with a small share of what's been called transitional funding - about £300m to help councils following pressure from Conservative MPs. Think back to the vote on Sunday trading. With a majority of only 17 in the Commons, the Conservatives lost the vote when 20 odd rebelled. Last month there would've been another rebellion, including some of our own Tory MPs in the East Midlands, if something wasn't done to improve the local government finance settlement over the next four years. The money has gone largely to shire counties. Leicestershire got £6.6m spread over two years, enough to save some services from closure. But it's a drop in the ocean for an authority with a £19m black hole in the budget every year after the latest cutbacks. Labour have protested that 83% of the councils getting transition funding are Conservative-run. Many Labour-run",1,4,4

He said he would now look at the 125 existing marine protected areas to see if further improvements could be made. The Marine Conservation Society (MCS) described it as an ""embarrassing U-turn"" for the Welsh government, and has called for better protection of seas. Creating the zones would mean a ban on fishing and anchoring in some areas and had brought opposition. The Welsh Fishermen's Association said previously that existing conservation networks for Welsh waters are adequate. The Welsh government proposed the zones last year with the backing of the Countryside Council of Wales and the Marine Conservation Society. The minister for natural resources said the decision had been made after the thousands of responses to the consultation brought ""divergent and strongly held views"". Mr Davies said to ""avoid any continuing uncertainty over the options presented in the 2012 consultation, I am also withdrawing all the proposed sites"". His comments come after the findings were published of a task and finish team which reviewed the feedback. Now, he will concentrate on the existing 125 Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) that cover 36% of Welsh seas to see if any changes can be made rather than creating additional zones. ""We are now in a stronger position to assess our current contribution to the network's ecological coherence,"" he said. ""I have, therefore, commissioned an assessment of our current MPAs to identify if there are any gaps and what the options might be to fill those gaps. ""If any measures are required, I believe they should be simple, proportionate and fit for purpose."" Dr Peter Richardson, biodiversity programme manager for MCS, said the Welsh government ""spent an awful lot of time and money and encouraged other people to put effort into this consultation response"". He said: ""70% of the consultation responses were in favour of designating these sites and yet today the minister has announced he's scrapping the whole thing... bit of an embarrassing U-turn for the government I think.""

The couple spoke out in response to consultation on proposed reform of sentencing for driving offences. They believe increased sentences should be backed up by manslaughter charges. Mr Moores, 28, was killed by a Vauxhall Astra driven by Donna Hackett on the M4 near Swindon. Hackett, then aged 26, fled and was found by police asleep in a ditch. She served half of a six-year jail term after she was found guilty of causing death by careless driving while drunk.

The ruling preserves the law known as Obamacare, which Mr Obama considers a major part of his presidential legacy. Republicans have vowed to continue fighting the law. ""We've got more work to do, but what we're not going to do is unravel what has now been woven into the fabric of America,"" Mr Obama said. The case, known as King v Burwell, was the second major challenge the law has faced in the US's highest court. Unlike in many other western countries, the US does not have a single-payer healthcare system. Private companies, rather than the US government, provide health insurance for US citizens. The enactment of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) - one of Mr Obama's most significant and controversial domestic achievements - in 2010 mandated that every American had to purchase private insurance. It provided the subsidies to allow many to do so. In 2012, the mandate portion of the law was challenged in the court. The justices ruled to preserve it. In that decision, as in the decision on Thursday, Chief Justice John Roberts surprised observers by siding with his liberal colleagues in support of the law. ""Congress passed the Affordable Care act to improve health insurance markets, not to destroy them,"" Chief Justice John Roberts wrote in the opinion. Justice Anthony Kennedy dissented in 2012, but sided with the majority on Thursday. Had the court made the opposite decision, an estimated 8.7 million people in the US would have been at risk of losing the aid that makes healthcare affordable. The stakes could not have been higher. People's health (crucially important) and Obama's legacy (less important, but for him and those around him fairly vital) were at stake. Well a politically finely balanced Supreme Court has given an emphatic, overwhelming vote in favour of the president by 6-3. I bet ""No-drama Obama"" is high-fiving anyone and everyone in the White House - that is how big it is. Obama defies lame-duck expectations Demonstrators gathered outside the court as early on Thursday morning. Reading updates on their mobile phones, the crowd became jubilant when they learned mid-morning that the court had ruled in their favour. Some began dancing, while others chanted ""If you're covered and you know it clap your hands.""

""The ACA is not just the law of the land, it will remain the law of the land"". ""Today is a good day for healthcare in America,"" said activist Benton Strong. ""I hope this is the end of the line."" Demonstrators opposing the subsidies did not have a large visible presence. Justice Antonin Scalia wrote in his dissent that the Supreme Court is setting a precedent of favouring some laws over others.

Downing Street did not comment on President Obama's remark to the PM about defence spending, reportedly made before Chancellor George Osborne said the government would fulfil a Nato pledge to spend 2% of national income on defence last year.

The toppling of the Gaddafi regime in Libya - following UN-backed air strikes designed to protect civilians - led to a power vacuum and instability, with no authority in full control. The intervention was led by the UK and France - and in his interview, Mr Obama reflects on ""what went wrong"", saying: ""There's room for criticism, because I had more faith in the Europeans, given Libya's proximity, being invested in the follow-up."" Mr Cameron, he said, became ""distracted by a range of other things"". He also criticised former French President Nicolas Sarkozy, saying he had tried to claim the spotlight. The former French president, he said, ""wanted to trumpet the flights he was taking in the air campaign, despite the fact that we had wiped out all the air defences and essentially set up the entire infrastructure"" for the intervention. President Obama said the intervention ""averted large-scale civilian casualties (and) prevented what almost surely would have been a prolonged and bloody civil conflict"". But he added: ""And despite all that, Libya is a mess."" He also criticised what he called ""free riders"" in the interview, saying European and Gulf countries were calling for action against Gaddafi, adding: ""But what has been a habit over the last several decades in these circumstances is people pushing us to act but then showing an unwillingness to put any skin in the game."" Despite efforts to support Libya's National Transitional Council, and the first elections in the country for decades, it rapidly descended into violence, with two rival governments and the formation of hundreds of militias, some allied to so-called Islamic State.

Elderly residents were moved out of Greyhound Opening and nearby Goldsmith Street seven years ago after Norwich City Council agreed to redevelop the site. The council agreed that new employees relocating to the city could move in temporarily ahead of demolition. However other staff, including Ms Reeves, also moved in, in contravention of council policy. The council resisted calls for a full independent inquiry. Its own investigation found safeguards covering conflicts of interest were in place but not followed. In February 2009, London-based architects Riches Hawley Mikhail won a competition to design a new social housing development on the site, but they were never commissioned. During that year homes on the derelict site were demolished, but the site has since remained untouched.",1,3,4

Political leaders, businesses, sporting organisations, and charities will meet at Lancaster House on Thursday. Mr Cameron says corruption is ""the root of so many of the world's problems"". He also described it as ""an enemy of progress"". ""It destroys jobs and holds back economic growth, traps the poorest in desperate poverty, and undermines our security by pushing people towards extremist groups,"" he added. ""The battle against corruption will not be won overnight. It will take time, courage and determination to deliver the reforms that are necessary. But we cannot hope to solve the major global challenges we face without tackling the exploitation, fraud and dishonesty at their heart. ""For too long there has been a taboo about tackling this issue head-on. The summit will change that. Together we will push the fight against corruption to the top of the international agenda where it belongs."" Among the world leaders attending the summit are presidents Ashraf Ghani of Afghanistan, Juan Manuel Santos of Colombia and Muhammadu Buhari of Nigeria, and Norwegian prime minister Erna Solberg. Russia is to be represented by deputy foreign minister Oleg Syromolotov. Panellists are expected to include World Bank president Jim Yong Kim and International Monetary Fund's managing director Christine Lagarde. Under the prime minister's plans, leaders at the summit would pledge to expose corruption and pursue and punish those who perpetrate, facilitate or are complicit in it. Campaigners have also called for a crackdown on tax havens linked to the United Kingdom. The recent Panama Papers leak showed how some wealthy people use offshore firms to evade tax and avoid sanctions. A Downing Street spokesman said: ""We are in discussions with the Overseas Territories and Crown dependencies with major financial centres about their attendance, and expect a number to join the summit."" Robert Barrington, of anti-corruption campaigners Transparency International, said: ""The prime minister is creating a platform for governments that are serious about fighting corruption to make really significant changes and set the agenda for a generation to come. ""What is key now is that other governments are persuaded to sign up to ambitious targets and that the UK government does not give in to the usual last minute attempts by less committed countries to water down the summit's ambitions"".",1,4,4

Archaeologist David Jacques, said: ""They... used the stump of the tree, about three metres high, as a wall."" The finds are being shown to United Nations heritage experts, who are currently visiting Stonehenge. Archaeologists are concerned a planned 2.9km tunnel being considered for the nearby A303 main road will damage the site. Discoveries have also shown stones were warmed up by the Mesolithic Period inhabitants and used in a hearth to emit heat in the earthy snug. Mr Jacques, a senior research fellow at the University of Buckingham, has worked at Blick Mead for over a decade, making a number of discoveries about the inhabitants. The tree stump created a wall height similar to a ""modern bungalow"". ""They've draped probably animal skins or thatch around the basin and connected it to a post so it's a very comfortable snug little place,"" he said. The wooden wall of the hollow was lined with flints and the large earthy pit created by the tree root lined with cobbles and decorated with ""exotic"" stones from outside the area. ""There are some clever and sophisticated things going on, the hot stones that they put into this little type of alcove wouldn't have been on fire,"" explained Mr Jacques. ""It looks more like these people have been using these hot stones as a type of storage heater so that you've got a lot of warmth coming off them."" Mr Jacques will meet the UN experts later to ask for the route to be moved closer to Salisbury and for hydrological assessments to be made. ""It's very likely the water flow would be reduced in and around the site,"" he said. ""It would take out all the organics and destroy all the animal bone we've been finding which is crucial for finding where they have been living and for getting radiocarbon dates from all the organics like pollen and wood. ""This is massively important for reconstructing what the landscape would have looked like."" Andy Rhind-Tutt, former mayor and chairman of Amesbury Museum and Heritage Trust said: ""I sincerely hope the team delivering the long-awaited A303 improvement look seriously at an alternative alignment south of Salisbury and away from this unequalled archaeological landscape. ""It would be criminal to destroy such a rich heritage and connection with our ancestors for the sake of blocking the view to the passing public of Stonehenge.""",1,4,4

Their intention in travelling to the region, where areas are controlled by Islamic State (IS) militants or an al-Qaeda affiliate, is not clear. The Foreign Office has said it is in contact with the Turkish authorities. The BBC's Mark Lowen said the information about the ages of the children had not been independently verified and it was too early to know where the group were intending to head to. ""Were they heading for one of the more moderate groups in Syria. Were they heading for the area controlled by al-Nusra, the al-Qaeda affiliate? Or were they heading to so-called Islamic State territory?"" he said. The group was taken to a police station in southern Turkey overnight, and then sent to the foreigners department awaiting deportation to the UK. They have undergone medical examinations and had their finger-prints taken. The United Nations estimates the number of foreign fighters joining militant groups is more than 25,000, from 100 different nations. About 600 Britons are believed to have gone to Syria or Iraq since IS seized control of large swathes of territory there. Most are thought to have volunteered as fighters for the militant Islamist group. Around half are believed to have later returned to the UK, the Metropolitan Police has said. The latest detentions come two weeks after three British teenagers were stopped from travelling into Syria from Turkey. The three - two aged 17 and one 19, from north-west London - were arrested following a tip-off from British police and flown back to the UK. They have since been released on police bail. They had flown to Turkey from Barcelona and were arrested at Sabiha Gokcen airport in Istanbul. Fadi Hakura, Turkey analyst for Chatham House, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the recent arrests showed the Turkish government was ""taking more effective measures to control the flow of fighters and supporters into Syria"". He said there was now ""more enhanced security and intelligence cooperation between Turkey and its Western counterparts, especially with the exchange of names that Turkey needs to prohibit [IS supporters] from crossing into Syria"". The Turkish government has said it cannot make a 560-mile border watertight and will act when it has prior warning. In February this year there were recriminations between British police and Turkish officials after three London schoolgirls disappeared from Turkey, apparently having crossed the border into Syria.

Some of the items found included an armour-piercing improvised rocket and two anti-personnel mines. The main line of police inquiry is the arms belonged to dissident republicans. Last week, Home Secretary Theresa May said MI5 believed an attack on targets in Great Britain by dissident republicans had become ""a strong possibility"". Analysis: Vincent Kearney, BBC News NI's home affairs correspondent The discovery of what appears to be a second dissident republican arms dump near Larne within three months has left police baffled. Based on location alone, the analysis would be that the items found most likely belonged to loyalist paramilitaries. But the nature of what was found suggests otherwise and the finger of suspicion firmly in the direction of dissident republicans. Det Supt Kevin Geddes said the threat level in Northern Ireland from dissident republican groups remains ""severe"" and an attack is ""highly likely"". Police officers found three barrels hidden in holes in the forest. As well as rockets and mines, there were also several pipe bombs, assault rifle ammunition and parts to construct a ""substantial number of explosive devices"". Det Supt Geddes said the seizure was significant ""both in terms of its size and its capability"". ""A number of these devices were ready to be deployed,"" he added. ""This seizure has undoubtedly saved lives."" He said the type of weapons that had been found meant police would focus their investigation on dissident republicans. In March, an arms find was made at Carnfunnock Country Park near Larne, and police said the were investigating a connection between the two discoveries. ""There are links in terms of the general location and the manner and method of storage and packaging of these munitions,"" Det Supt Geddes said.

It was sent to UKIP's national executive committee (NEC) before a row over racial slurs about a Labour MP, for which Ms Brown apologised. But UKIP chairman Paul Oakden said the letter did not follow proper process. A UKIP assembly group spokesman said the letter was written by a group with a ""long-standing grudge"" against the AM. The ruling NEC body discussed the issue at a meeting on Friday, where they also decided to allow a controversial anti-Islam campaigner to run for the UKIP leadership. Mr Oakden said: ""A member of the NEC had contacted the person that is putting this forward and said to them they need to follow the proper process of completing the necessary forms and submitting them to the NEC. ""Members simply emailing the NEC saying we want you to do this is not the correct disciplinary process for the party, by any stretch of the imagination. ""A member of the NEC has gone back and given advice on what they need to do."" Shaun Owen, secretary of UKIP's Delyn branch, wrote to the NEC saying: ""For some time we have been appalled by the abrasive and discourteous manner of Ms Brown towards UKIP locally. ""Her lack of effort in pursuing the aims of the party both locally and nationally is of concern to members across the region."" Mr Owen added he believed members would stop supporting UKIP if Ms Brown remained in the role. However, a spokesman for the party's assembly group dismissed the letter as written by a ""tiny and insignificant group"". In February, Ms Brown denied an allegation she had smoked recreational drugs in a hotel room. Later that month, she said she had acted ""with propriety"" after it was revealed she had discussed how an advert for a job in her assembly office could be changed to help her brother get an interview for the post. Meanwhile, UKIP's NEC confirmed that 11 hopefuls in the contest to succeed Paul Nuttall as leader will be able to run as candidates. The list includes Anne Marie Waters, the founder of the Sharia Watch pressure group, who has described Islam as evil. UKIP AM David Rowlands had said Ms Waters is probably ""too extreme"" to be allowed to stand but she claimed the party was trying to ""ostracise"" her. Other candidates who have also cleared the NEC's vetting process and are going forward to a vote of the membership include Welsh activist John Rees-Evans, London Assembly member Peter Whittle and Scottish MEP David Coburn.

""And then we will send that equipment to Houston where we will finish rehearsals. Fans can expect a performance that spans my career so far."" She has a high standard to live up to - notably Prince's show in 2007, which took place in the middle of a Miami thunderstorm and is widely accepted as the greatest performance in the event's history, if not Prince's career. Here are some of the other most memorable - and surprising - moments from the last 30 years. Super Bowl performers get a very strict 12-minute time limit, so most performers cram their set with as much music as possible. Not Michael Jackson. After shooting onto the stage at the Pasadena Rose Bowl, he stood completely still, staring at the world for a full 90 seconds. Ninety. It was a master class in ratcheting expectation to a fever pitch. And the screams when he launched into Jam (not one of his best songs) proved he knew what he was doing. Brilliantly, Jackson staged this entire performance while wearing a jacket it looked like he'd borrowed from Muammar Gaddafi. Beat that, Gaga. Baby, he was born to run... and slide on his knees... and crotch slam a TV camera. In his autobiography, The Boss explains the incident like this: ""Too much adrenalin, a late drop, too much speed, here I come, Mikeâ€¦ BOOM! ""And I'm onto his camera, the lens implanted into my chest with one leg off the stage. I use his camera to push myself back up andâ€¦ BLAM! BORN TO RUN!""

It was sent to UKIP's national executive committee (NEC) before a row over racial slurs about a Labour MP, for which Ms Brown apologised. But UKIP chairman Paul Oakden said the letter did not follow proper process. A UKIP assembly group spokesman said the letter was written by a group with a ""long-standing grudge"" against the AM. The ruling NEC body discussed the issue at a meeting on Friday, where they also decided to allow a controversial anti-Islam campaigner to run for the UKIP leadership. Mr Oakden said: ""A member of the NEC had contacted the person that is putting this forward and said to them they need to follow the proper process of completing the necessary forms and submitting them to the NEC. ""Members simply emailing the NEC saying we want you to do this is not the correct disciplinary process for the party, by any stretch of the imagination. ""A member of the NEC has gone back and given advice on what they need to do."" Shaun Owen, secretary of UKIP's Delyn branch, wrote to the NEC saying: ""For some time we have been appalled by the abrasive and discourteous manner of Ms Brown towards UKIP locally. ""Her lack of effort in pursuing the aims of the party both locally and nationally is of concern to members across the region."" Mr Owen added he believed members would stop supporting UKIP if Ms Brown remained in the role. However, a spokesman for the party's assembly group dismissed the letter as written by a ""tiny and insignificant group"". In February, Ms Brown denied an allegation she had smoked recreational drugs in a hotel room. Later that month, she said she had acted ""with propriety"" after it was revealed she had discussed how an advert for a job in her assembly office could be changed to help her brother get an interview for the post. Meanwhile, UKIP's NEC confirmed that 11 hopefuls in the contest to succeed Paul Nuttall as leader will be able to run as candidates. The list includes Anne Marie Waters, the founder of the Sharia Watch pressure group, who has described Islam as evil. UKIP AM David Rowlands had said Ms Waters is probably ""too extreme"" to be allowed to stand but she claimed the party was trying to ""ostracise"" her. Other candidates who have also cleared the NEC's vetting process and are going forward to a vote of the membership include Welsh activist John Rees-Evans, London Assembly member Peter Whittle and Scottish MEP David Coburn.

Since then, efforts have been continuing to rescue it from closure and save the jobs of its 11,000 staff. Last week, a surprise late bid led by retail veteran Greg Tufnell transformed the race to acquire the retailer. His team, said to be backed by Portuguese money, is the front-runner. But if a deal cannot be struck, the business may still have to be liquidated. The remaining bidders have faded into the background. Another consortium led by Matalan tycoon John Hargreaves and Turkish retail entrepreneur Cafer Mahiroglu has reportedly run into difficulties, while other suitors have apparently failed to impress with their proposals. Some of those involved in the different bids have impressive retailing histories. But then Sir Philip Green, who controlled BHS from 2000 to 2015, also had a brilliant track record. And he ended up selling the business for Â£1. So what are the chances of saving BHS from the liquidators? And just who are the people aiming to do it? In the public eye, Greg Tufnell is easily overshadowed by his more famous brother Phil, the former England cricketer. But that could change if his bid for BHS is successful, because he hopes to become the firm's next chairman. And as far as his credentials for the job are concerned, the 54-year-old executive certainly talks the talk. He describes himself as ""a highly experienced managing director with Mothercare and Arcadia, a blend of entrepreneur, strategist and hands-on operator with significant commercial business turnaround, acquisition and fund-raising experience"". His record shows that he was buying and merchandising director at Next from 1991 to 1994. He then spent three years as managing director of menswear retailer Burton, part of the Arcadia group, followed by another three years as managing director of Mothercare. He currently appears to occupy a portfolio of different jobs, including the chairmanships of leather accessories brand Zatchels and recruitment consultancy hga Group. Earlier this month, he registered a new firm, Richess Group, at Companies House. Its other directors are Nick de Scossa, a Swiss banker, and Lisbon-based entrepreneur Jose Maria Soares Bento. Until Mr Tufnell's bid turned up, many observers had assumed that BHS would be snapped up by Matalan founder Mr Hargreaves. But it appears that the cost of a deal may have proved too high. Sources say Mr Hargreaves was asked to improve his offer and balked. Like Sir Philip Green, 71-year-old John Hargreaves also enjoys the life of the super-rich. He has an estimated fortune of Â£1bn, according to the Sunday Times Rich List. But in stark contrast to the ebullient Sir Philip, Mr Hargreaves is described by industry insiders as quiet-spoken, someone who shuns the limelight. Mr Hargreaves is no longer directly involved in the business he founded. He sold his 69% stake in Matalan in 2000, then in 2006 took it private through Missouri Bidco, a company 53.5% owned by him and his family.

His intervention in the debate - made, as he termed it, with ""deafening eclat"" - was even said to have helped cause the pound to slide on the international money markets as traders thought it made the possibility of a so-called Brexit more likely. He has arguably the highest profile of any of the governing Conservative Party except the Prime Minister David Cameron, but those outside the UK may be wondering: who is he, and is that actually his hair? Read on. Profile: Boris Johnson How could 'zip wire prat' become prime minister? Read more about the UK's referendum on the EU Alexander Boris de Pfeffel Johnson, to give him his full name, was born in New York and is descended from Turkish, French and German stock. He describes himself as a ""one-man melting pot"". He first made a name for himself in journalism, including a stint as Brussels correspondent for the right-wing Daily Telegraph newspaper and editor of The Spectator magazine. His humorous persona led him to become a fixture on various television programmes, including the satirical BBC panel show Have I Got News For You. He still has a lucrative and entertaining column in the Daily Telegraph, in which august forum he explained the reasons for his decision on the EU. As a politician, he has been a Conservative member of parliament for two constituencies, Henley from 2001 to 2008 and then Uxbridge and South Ruislip from 2015. Lest you think he was putting his feet up between parliamentary mandates, he is also currently serving the second of two terms as mayor of London, no mean feat in a city where the centre-left Labour Party has dominated in recent decades. That's indicative of the position Mr Johnson has carved out for himself as one of the most charismatic politicians in the UK who has wide appeal beyond Conservative heartlands - polling has suggested that his stance on the EU referendum may sway some undecided voters. Just look what happens when you type his name into Google.co.uk. Not quite. He has previously courted controversy for his remarks about (among others) the populations of Liverpool, Portsmouth and Papua New Guinea, not to mention run-ins with his own party leadership and TV chef Jamie Oliver. Last October he accidentally flattened a 10-year-old schoolboy at what was meant to be a friendly game of photo-op rugby in Japan. But none of this seems to have affected his standing among the party faithful or the public at large. Even getting stuck on a zip-wire during the London Olympics in 2012, a sure-fire route to derision for any other politician, only enhanced his eccentric image. Mr Johnson finally ended months of speculation about which side of the EU debate he would back in an immaculately impromptu media scrum outside his home in North London, having reportedly informed the prime minister of his decision earlier the same day.

The building has regenerated the area around Melton Mowbray's railway station, once a muddy pot-holed piece of wasteland where those in the know parked for free. Now the council offices link the station to a park and the town centre. It was partly paid for with insurance money after a fire destroyed the old offices on the other side of town. A supermarket moved in to replace it and helped with the money too, putting the council on a firm financial footing. But that was four years ago and the crisis is a different one today. It's being experienced by all local authorities - cuts in central government funding which threaten the services they provide. Mr Rhodes is also deputy leader of Leicestershire County Council, with responsibility for finance. Leicestershire is historically the poorest funded council in the country because of a quirk of Whitehall recalculations, going back a quarter of a century since the poll tax, or community charge, was scrapped. At the moment councils get income from council tax, a share of the business rates, any income they generate themselves from services plus a grant from central government. It's the grant cut which is causing them grief. What's called the ""core funding"" is worked out by the number of homes multiplied by a set amount. And each authority has a different value set per dwelling. If we look at Surrey, which is top of the table, the amount will be £1,686 by 2019/20. Nottinghamshire is mid-table at £1,482, Derbyshire is in the lower reaches with £1,422 per dwelling and then comes Leicestershire at £1,354. ""The funding system is chaotic,"" says Byron Rhodes. ""It doesn't reflect real need. Look at Oxfordshire which is an interesting example,"" he says with a glint in his eye. Could he possibly be referring to the prime ministerial plea to the county council about cutbacks to services there? ""If we had the same funding as Oxfordshire, we'd have £50m a year extra. If we had the same as Surrey, we'd have £100m more. We'd be partying everyday if we had that kind of money."" Leicestershire have been helped with a small share of what's been called transitional funding - about £300m to help councils following pressure from Conservative MPs. Think back to the vote on Sunday trading. With a majority of only 17 in the Commons, the Conservatives lost the vote when 20 odd rebelled. Last month there would've been another rebellion, including some of our own Tory MPs in the East Midlands, if something wasn't done to improve the local government finance settlement over the next four years. The money has gone largely to shire counties. Leicestershire got £6.6m spread over two years, enough to save some services from closure. But it's a drop in the ocean for an authority with a £19m black hole in the budget every year after the latest cutbacks.

But he also raised concerns about possible damage to the site over plans to build a road tunnel past Stonehenge. The Department of Transport said it would ""consult before any building"". The Blick Mead site is about 1.5 miles (2.4km) from Stonehenge and archaeologists said ""scientifically tested charcoal"" dug up from the site had ""revealed that it dated from around 4000 BC"". David Jacques said the dig had also found ""evidence of feasting"" including burnt flints, tools and remains of giant cattle, known as aurochs, which were eaten by early hunter gatherers. Mr Jacques said: ""British pre-history may have to be rewritten. This is the latest dated Mesolithic encampment ever found in the UK. ""Blick Mead site connects the early hunter gatherer groups returning to Britain after the Ice Age to the Stonehenge area, all the way through to the Neolithic in the late 5th Millennium BC.

Andy Rhind-Tutt, a former mayor and current chairman of Amesbury Museum, which part-funded the dig, said the discovery could ""provide what archaeologists have been searching for centuries - the answer to the story of the pre-history of Stonehenge."" Earlier this month, the government announced funding for a 1.8-mile (2.9km) tunnel to remove congestion from the main road past Stonehenge.

openai_text-ada-001 (0 shot),England's captain Alastair Cook was disappointed with the way his team came so close to victory before being defeated by ailing Pakistan's Younus Khan.,"Pakistan seemed to be cruising to a draw before debutant Adil Rashid - who returned 0-163 in the first innings - turned the match with five wickets. Needing 99 to win, England sent out Jos Buttler and Ben Stokes in the top four. But they were eventually beaten by the fading light, finishing 25 runs short of a famous victory on 74-4. The tourists could not find the boundary frequently enough before the umpires brought the teams off, with Joe Root 33 not out. However, this was a hugely impressive performance from England and one that will fill them with confidence ahead of the second Test in Dubai, which begins on Thursday. After England concluded their innings on 598-9 in the morning, Pakistan looked assured at 113-3 shortly after tea, leading by 38 with seven second-innings wickets remaining. But the match turned when veteran batsman Younus Khan, playing in his 102nd Test match, mistimed a wild heave to give Rashid his first Test wicket - caught at point by Stokes. Rashid - whose figures in the first innings were the worst ever by a debutant - then quickly added a second victim, having Asad Shafiq caught behind for six. The door was opened for England, and Rashid and Moeen Ali barged through it as they polished off the last five wickets for 14 runs. Pakistan skipper Misbah ul-Haq - who had played with restraint for his 51 - inexplicably aimed an uncharacteristic slog at Moeen and was bowled. Moeen then removed Wahab Riaz caught behind, before Rashid claimed the final three wickets - all superbly caught at first slip by James Anderson. England sensed an unlikely victory, but their reorganised batting order could not score quickly enough as Pakistan's tactic of spin from both ends and fielders on the boundary brought them regular wickets. Makeshift opener Buttler was trapped lbw for four, Moeen and Stokes were caught on the boundary in quick succession, and Jonny Bairstow was stumped attempting a big shot. However, in truth it was mistakes earlier in the match that ultimately proved more costly as England fell just short of their first win on the subcontinent since beating India in Kolkata in 2012. In Pakistan's first innings, Ian Bell dropped Mohammad Hafeez (98) and Shafiq (107) at slip early in their innings. And Shoaib Malik, who made 245, was dismissed off a no-ball by Stuart Broad. England captain Alastair Cook, whose record-breaking 263 in the first innings was ultimately in vain, admitted England were frustrated to come so close to victory. ""We'd have liked another three or four overs at the end but that's the way it goes,"" he said. ""I can't fault the guys for hanging in there on that wicket. ""The pitch did deteriorate and spun more today which gave us hope, so it's a bit of a bittersweet finish. We knew we had to put the pressure on Pakistan and then on the last day you never know.

At least nine clinical commissioning groups (CCGs) were offering GP practices payments for hitting targets, according to Pulse's investigation. In one case, Birmingham South Central CCG was offering practices more than Â£11,000 to reduce new outpatient attendances, follow-ups, A&E attendances and emergency admissions by 1%, compared with 2014/15. It said the schemes, which exclude cancer referrals, were designed to ""incentivise best quality practice"" and ""drive improvements in the quality of primary medical care"". ""Our priority is to ensure that patients have access to services that they need, when they need them,"" said a spokesperson for Birmingham South Central CCG. Another CCG told Pulse it had considered the ""full impact"" of the incentive scheme and was ""confident that there is no conflict of interest"". Pulse said that one scheme had already been looked at by the General Medical Council, the body which regulates medical standards in the UK, after local GP leaders expressed their concern. The magazine pointed out that initial hospital referrals for cancer patients should happen within two weeks of a GP first suspecting the condition. Dr Chand Nagpaul, chairman of the GPs committee of the doctors' trade union the British Medical Association, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that such schemes were a ""financial contaminant"" to patient-doctor trust. He said: ""It's short-sighted and misguided of CCGs to introduce such mechanisms, because they do lead to the potential for patients questioning the motives of GP referrals.

She wrote ""The Catcher in the Rye"" and ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" which are both classic novels.","Harper Lee's classic was published 50 years ago this summer and it remains the only novel she ever wrote. Lee, 84, has never explained why she stopped writing. She doesn't give interviews - ""Hell, no"" was her response to a request several decades ago - and that silence has only added to the intrigue. But her close friend Thomas Lane Butts, a retired minister in her hometown, Monroeville, Alabama, says she once told him the reason. Sitting on a pew in the Methodist church which the Lee family still attends, he described to me how she suddenly brought the subject up one night over dinner in New York. ""She asked me, 'You ever wonder why I didn't write anything else?' And I said, 'Along with several million other people, yes, I had wondered about that.' And she said, 'Well, what do you think?'"" Speaking in his slow southern drawl, the Rev Butts, who just turned 80, suggested to her that she had already written a great book and therefore didn't need to compete with herself. ""And when I got through she said, 'You're all wrong.' I said, 'Alright, smart Alec. You tell me.' She said, 'I would not go through all the deprivation of privacy through which I went for this book again for any amount of money.' ""And she said, 'I did not need to write another book. I said what I wanted to say in that book.'"" Harper Lee called it a simple tale about the ""conflict of the human soul"" and Monroeville, Alabama, is where she drew her inspiration. The story depicts the segregated South of her childhood, during the Depression. It was published at the height of the civil rights struggle. The Rev Butts grew up 10 miles outside Monroeville. By the late 1950s, he says, he was a ""fuzzy-cheeked young preacher"" campaigning for an end to segregation. He had met Martin Luther King Jr and signed a petition to boycott buses. The Ku Klux Klan had left a burning cross on his front lawn. He says To Kill a Mockingbird was not well received in Monroeville when it was published. ""The people who were hard racist did not like it because of the implication of the book,"" the Rev Butts told me. ""The book revealed racism and that always frightens a racist - when you pull the cover off them. ""Those of us who stood up for civil rights were much encouraged by the book because in a very skilful and subtle way it addressed itself for justice."" But these days, the Rev Butts says, there is enormous civic pride in Monroeville. The old courthouse, which Hollywood re-created for the film, now houses a museum to Harper Lee and the town's other literary icon, Truman Capote. Capote was a childhood friend of hers and is thought to be the inspiration for the Dill character in To Kill a Mockingbird. The town's residents often try to protect Lee, allowing her to live a normal life instead of being hounded by fans or bothered with prying questions. ""Being famous",1,5,5

India is struggling with inflation and currency weakness.,"India's gross domestic product (GDP) grew by 5.3% in the quarter compared with a year earlier, data showed. That is down from 6.1% in the previous quarter. Analysts were expecting the same figure for January to March. India is the third-largest economy in Asia but has been struggling with inflation and currency weakness. Since July last year, the Indian rupee has seen one of the biggest declines among Asian currencies, dropping more than 27% against the US dollar. ""Shocking numbers as growth was even lower than lows witnessed during the financial crisis,"" said Anubhuti Sahay from Standard Chartered Bank in Mumbai. The BBC's Yogita Limaye in Mumbai said that just a year ago India was aspiring for double-digit growth. But a global slowdown has reduced external demand, and high inflation coupled with a weak rupee has made things more expensive within the country. Domestic demand, which India's economy is largely reliant on, has also slowed in part due to the political upheaval in the country. India's economy is suffering from ""policy incoherence, shifting global risk appetite and a comatose government"", said Rajeev Malik, senior economist at brokerage CLSA India's Prime Minister Manmohan Singh admitted early this month that his government must do more to get the once fast-growing economy moving again. The Congress-led coalition government is caught up in a slew of corruption scandals. Key policy reforms, including allowing foreign investment in India's retail sector, have been delayed in parliament for more than a year. This has worried foreign investors and threatened the country's investment grade credit rating. ""This is definitely a very important signal for the government - this is a make or break situation for India and the government has to step on the panic button,"" said Rupa Rege Nitsure, chief economist at Bank of Baroda in Mumbai.

Last month, the Supreme Court ruled that the anthem must be played in every cinema before a film is screened. Some 20 people have been held in Kerala and Tamil Nadu since then for remaining seated during the anthem. Also, India's colonial-era sedition law has been often used against students, journalists, writers and social activists and those critical of the government.

Senior police official Sateesh Bino told the NDTV news channel that the writer-activist ""is being questioned for his controversial post on the national anthem on Facebook"" and had been charged with sedition. Earlier this month, 12 people were arrested at a cinema in Kerala, after they remained seated while the national anthem played.

Lennon saw the vacancy as an opportunity, and that was enough to encourage Hibs that a figure of his profile and experience would accept a role in the Championship. Even though his last job in Scotland involved leading a team on Champions League duty, Lennon's mind has not been swayed by haughtiness. The appointment of the former Celtic manager as successor to Alan Stubbs suits both parties, because it is mutually beneficial. Success is alluring, and Hibs offer Lennon the chance to accumulate more achievements. He was immediately engaged in crisis management at his previous club Bolton, but will find stability, potential and accomplishment at Easter Road. The demand will be to deliver promotion, but that will not seem daunting when the majority of the squad that pushed Rangers for a while last season then won the Scottish Cup is still in place. Lennon's task is to refine and bolster the team, when new managers are often faced with a period of overhaul. Stubbs left the club on an emotional high after delivering their first Scottish Cup in 114 years, but before the final against Rangers there was a tangible sense of exasperation that promotion had been missed. Hibs were entitled to feel that it was an unnecessary failure given their circumstances. The club is about to embark on a third season in the Championship, but by most other measures they can be considered a top-flight outfit. The budget will be significantly more than the rest of the teams in the division, the training ground at East Mains and facilities are first-class, the football side of the business is stable and well-run by George Craig, the club's head of football operations, the squad is full of talent. Lennon can rely on consistently assured performances from the likes of David Gray, Darren McGregor, Paul Hanlon, Lewis Stevenson, John McGinn, Fraser Fyvie, Dylan McGeouch, James Keatings and Jason Cummings. Some minor issues remain, such as who will fill the goal next season, but the challenge is more on adding depth and strength of will to the squad and man-management. McGinn, one of the most reliably effective players in the Championship last season, has already insisted that he remains committed to Hibs despite the failure to achieve promotion. The 21-year-old midfielder provides the kind of industry and spirit that a team can be built around. There may be critical decisions to make, though, since Cummings is entering the final year of his contract and so represents a sellable asset. He is a regular goalscorer, though, and Stubbs had to sign Anthony Stokes on loan last January to provide some support up front. These are tweaks compared to the amount of work Stubbs had to carry out when he was appointed two years ago. Hibs are ready to be guided forward, not waiting to be rescued. When Lennon left Celtic two years ago, it was to pursue a",1,3,4

Liam Craig sealed the win from the penalty spot with two minutes to play, before Graham Cummins finished a sumptuous stoppage-time move. And things got worse still for Caley Thistle after the match, with captain Gary Warren shown a red card in the tunnel. Saints remain five points clear of Hearts in fourth place, and closed the gap on third-placed Rangers, who play Aberdeen on Sunday, to three points. With game after game ticking past, Inverness' position looks increasingly perilous. Next weekend's trip to Motherwell, second-bottom on goal difference, is now seismic. This contest turned nightmarish for the hosts after a bright opening, but the truth is, given their predicament, Caley Thistle did not threaten St Johnstone's goal enough. Billy Mckay sent a shot over from close range. Alex Fisher nodded a diving header wide. Carl Tremarco miscued a volley. Greg Tansey did draw a save from Alan Mannus when he rasped in an effort from outside the box, but Richie Foran's side never looked likely to find the net. Their best opportunity came immediately after the Saints went ahead, when Tansey fed Cole, who seemed to panic in a terrific position and shot straight at Mannus. Cole's dismissal ended the contest when he appeared to be cautioned twice for challenging referee Stephen Finnie's decision not to award a foul. St Johnstone were merciless and could have had more. With just one win from their last 21 league games, Inverness look deep in trouble. Tommy Wright's side deserve so much credit. Saints were tactically brilliant, so strong defensively and ruthlessly capitalised on their man advantage. They took one of their few first-half chances when Michael Coulson broke down the left and sent a dangerous ball across the six-yard box. Owain Fon Williams could only parry into the danger area, Cummins' shot was blocked but Maclean followed up to force it home. They should have had another when Craig's superb curling corner flew all the way to the back post where Cummins slid in and somehow knocked it over from two yards. Craig, in his 300th appearance for the club, coolly converted a spot-kick after Cummins was tripped to seal the points. Cummins then slammed home after Miller danced around the area to tee him up, before Craig cracked the bar amid the late flurry.

State media picked up the story on Thursday, which was first reported in a local evening paper earlier this week. Liaoshen Wanbao reported the 49-year-old woman in Shenyang city had claimed her husband had divorced her 10 years ago because he disliked the shape of her face, said to be ""large and square"" with ""fat cheeks"". She said it spurred her to undergo facial surgery three times at a local hospital to shave her jawbones and reshape her face into a slimmer shape. During the third surgery the doctors discovered that if they proceeded further her nerves may be damaged, and halted the procedure. The woman, identified only by her surname Wang, later sued the hospital for 1.7 million yuan ($260,900; Â£183,900) in damages. She alleged the surgery had left her with soreness in her chin, and she could only eat and drink through a straw as ""when she exerted force on her lower jaw, she had the sensation that it would break"". The hospital, however, argued that the surgeries were conducted according to regulations, and pointed out that they encouraged her to seek psychiatric help instead of a third operation, which she refused. After mediation the woman agreed to accept 20,000 yuan ($3,100, Â£2,200) as compensation, said the report. On Weibo, some condemned the woman's husband, but others also chastised the woman. One top-voted comment read: ""It's purely an excuse, if her face was large then why did he decide to marry her in the first place? If he stopped loving her then he should have just said so."" It continued: ""This woman is also very silly to have believed that her face shape was the real reason for the divorce, she is lying to herself."" Said another Weibo user: ""Even if you had gone for facial surgery and made your face smaller, he would still have found other reasons to divorce you."" One person noted the sharp difference in the compensation amount and voiced suspicions: ""1.7 million was dropped to 20,000, it makes me wonder if she really did have a problem with her jaw.""

Freezing care provider fees to save money was no long sustainable, it said. Ministers say extra money will help NHS and social care services work together. The survey, which was completed by 147 directors of adult social services for councils in England, suggests that funding reductions to social care budgets have totalled £4.6bn since 2010 - a 31% overall reduction. Budgets for adult social care - which provides practical support to people due to illness, disability, old age or a low income - will reduce by a further £500m in cash terms this year, it said. ""Taking the growth in numbers of older and disabled people into account, this means that an additional £1.1bn would be needed to provide the same level of service as last year,"" the report warned.

""In virtually all our authorities, the number in need is growing, while the complexity of their needs is increasing."" ADASS called for the government to ""protect essential care and support services to the most vulnerable members of our community"". But a government spokesman said the survey ""ignores"" a commitment to invest £10bn in health services that are being ""joined up"" with social care, by 2020. The BBC has launched an online guide to the care system for the over-65s. The ""care calculator"" covers residential care and the support provided in people's own homes, for tasks such as washing and dressing. Users can submit their postcode and find out how much each service costs where they live in the UK. There is also a dedicated BBC Cost of Care website, with news stories, analysis and video. The spokesman said: ""Increasing budgets isn't the only solution. By working innovatively and joining up health and social care we can improve care and also save money."" However, Councillor Izzi Seccombe, from the Local Government Association (LGA), said adult social care services were facing ""enormous pressures"" due to ""insufficient funding, growing demand and escalating costs"". ""We have long warned that investing in the NHS whilst social care budgets are under continual pressure is simply a false economy. ""It is social care services that support elderly and vulnerable people to maintain their independence, live in their own community and stay out of hospital longer,"" she added. Caroline Abrahams, charity director at Age UK, said the idea of a further £1bn coming out of social care budgets was ""chilling"".

""In a lifetime of pretty much impossible things that have happened to our band, this is the highlight,"" said frontman Win Butler. Earlier, every stage at the event was closed after lightning struck ground. Dance act Rudimental were escorted off the main stage mid-set, and had to abandon their planned encore - Feel The Love, with guest vocalist John Newman. ""We're quite upset,"" musician Amir Amor told the BBC, ""but we had a great time anyway"". Metallica's Lars Ulrich was flying into the site by helicopter as the storm descended. ""It was kind of frightening,"" he said. ""When we landed, all the people picking us up were going, 'we didn't expect you were going to fly in this weather'. ""But the pilot didn't say anything about that. We saw the lightning up there. I thought it was pyrotechnics for Arcade Fire."" The thunderstorm heralded a brief but torrential downpour, and the power cut took BBC coverage off the air. Music resumed on the main stage at 19:00 BST with Lily Allen, who dedicated an expletive-laden song to FIFA president Sepp Blatter. Other performers on Friday included Blondie, who proved so popular it became impossible to enter or leave The Other Stage at lunchtime, and Paolo Nutini, whose soulful ballads were a fitting soundtrack as dusk fell over Somerset. Sophie Ellis-Bextor sneaked some disco into her set at the largely-acoustic Avalon Stage, while the pulsing synthpop of Glaswegian band Chvrches made for a steamy atmosphere in the John Peel tent as fans danced off the downpour. Arcade Fire took to the stage shortly after 22:00 BST, their arrival heralded by a man dressed from head-to-toe in a mirrored suit. Bravely, considering the weather conditions, the 12-piece band were largely dressed in white, but if they were worried about laundry bills, it didn't show. They threw themselves around the stage, thrashing and spinning as though plagued by a swarm of invisible bees, each member switching instruments between - and often during - songs. As well as guitars, they played steel drums, xylophones and even a hurdy gurdy. Frontman Win Butler made frequent excursions into the audience and, during the song Flashbulb Eyes, plucked a camera from a press photographer and carried it on stage to capture the band's performance. The set list was evenly spread across their four albums, with highlights including No Cars Go, Neighborhood #1 (Tunnels) and Rebellion (Lies). The group's recurring subject matter of suburban despair and alienation might have seemed like an odd fit for Glastonbury's peace and love ethos, but there is an optimism and belief in humanity at the core of their music. Plus, they have really catchy choruses.

The murder, filmed on CCTV and on mobile phones, sparked outrage. The Church of the Almighty God cult is banned in China but claims to have millions of members. Following the brutal killing in May, Chinese authorities said that they detained hundreds of members of the cult, reports the BBC's Martin Patience in Beijing. Interviewed in prison later, one of the defendants, Zhang Lidong showed no remorse. He said: ""I beat her with all my might and stamped on her too. She was a demon. We had to destroy her."" The group had entered a small McDonalds branch in Zhaoyuan in Shandong province last May soliciting phone numbers and hoping to recruit members to their cult. Ms Wu was waiting in the restaurant with her seven-year-old son and when she refused to give her number, an act which prompted the beating while they screamed at other diners to keep away or they would face the same fate. The public face of the Church of the Almighty God is a website full of uplifting hymns and homilies. But its core belief is that God has returned to earth as a Chinese woman to wreak the apocalypse. The only person who claims direct contact with this god is a former physics teacher, Zhao Weishan, who founded the cult 25 years ago and has since fled to the United States, says BBC China Editor Carrie Gracie. No-one knows exactly where he is, but much of the website's message of outright hostility to the Chinese government is delivered in English as well as Chinese.

The City Deal scheme will see eight council areas around Glasgow receive about £1bn from the UK and Scottish governments. The councils also have the power to borrow extra cash. The Glasgow and Clyde Valley City Deal involved massive investment by both the Scottish and UK governments last year. Eight councils - Glasgow, East Renfrewshire, Renfrewshire, Inverclyde, North and South Lanarkshire and East and West Dunbartonshire - are involved. The City Deal scheme will see Westminster and Holyrood give £500m each in additional grant funding to the eight council areas. The councils will supplement this by borrowing £130m. Councillors from across all eight areas will meet to discuss some of the schemes. Several of the projects being discussed later are in East Renfrewshire, where £44m is expected to be invested over the next few years, with much of the money coming from the City Deal funding. One is a water sports park at the Dams to Darnley Country Park. It would open in 2017 and include a centre offering wakeboarding, the fastest-growing extreme sport in the world. A new railway station in Barrhead and sliproad from the M77 would serve an area which could become one of East Renfrewshire's fastest growth areas. The council expects 1,000 new homes to be built there. Another project would transform the Levern Works site in Barrhead. A site formerly occupied by Nestle, where pet food was once made, would be cleared. The site will then be marketed for development for a range of uses that will bring new jobs to Barrhead.

The permit does not allow the company to carry out fracking - hydraulic fracturing of the land - to extract any oil or gas. Fracking is subject to a temporary ban in Wales until decision-making powers on the practice are devolved.

""Once the work begins, our officers will regulate and monitor the site to ensure it complies with the conditions of the permit, to protect people and the environment."" The permit for exploratory drilling comes despite a moratorium on fracking in Wales pending devolution of responsibility for such decisions.

At the party's weekly press briefing, I asked the Welsh Conservative leader Andrew RT Davies, who was elected on the list, whether he'd stand as a constituency candidate in his home turf of the Vale of Glamorgan but he said he hadn't thought about it. Presumably those are the kind of decisions they will now feel more confident contemplating. The party will also have a huge amount of new data on voters which it'll be able to call upon and the belief that campaigning hard on the NHS helped the Tories cross the line in places like the Vale of Clwyd and Gower. The Conservatives feel it's them, rather than any of the other opposition parties, who have become the repository of votes from those who are disaffected by the state of the NHS. Welsh Labour are going to hold a ""short sharp"" analysis into what went wrong. Carwyn Jones was in line with most of the criticism of Ed Miliband when he told AMs that the party needed to appeal to small business owners who are not millionaires but who work hard. What will be more difficult is countering the argument on the NHS, which the former minister Alun Davies believes is already lost. Another potential difficulty for Welsh Labour will be dealing with unhappiness within the party over council re-organisation. Bernie Attridge, the deputy leader of Flintshire Council, has tweeted saying the party needs to be careful on local government reform if it wants to retain the support of grassroots councillors. It also seems to have been the case that Labour lost more votes to UKIP than the Conservatives, which is another challenge to overcome. But Labour will at least have the advantage that it will be David Cameron, and not Ed Miliband, carrying out the latest round of public sector cuts that are likely to take effect sooner rather than later. The question is whether Carwyn Jones is going to be able to turn that to his advantage when his own record in government will be under scrutiny. Plaid Cymru's education spokesman, Simon Thomas, also in the party's weekly press briefing, said he believed Leanne Wood could portray herself as an alternative first minister because of the way she emotionally connected with people in the campaign. The party now has a year to make that a credible proposition after it failed to gain any new seats and came fourth, behind UKIP, in the overall share of the vote, despite her unprecedented profile.

The fountain on Parkway in the town was built to celebrate the Queen's accession to the throne in 1952. It is supplied by an underground tank, but had to be switched off after the water level dropped and could not be refilled. The council is buying water from a landscaping firm which already supplies water from a natural lake source, to maintain the borough's open spaces. It cannot be drunk so is permitted under the hosepipe ban regulations. Council chief executive, Michel Saminaden, said: ""They have told us that there is an abundance of water in this lake so we are probably doing them a favour by taking it.""

The group has warned that 750 more foster carers are ""urgently"" needed to meet the demands of the care system. It urged people to ""open their hearts and homes"" to vulnerable youngsters. Currently, more than 5,500 children are in foster care in Scotland, living with 4,400 families and carers. The Fostering Network surveyed 250 children, teenagers and foster carers across Scotland and discovered that many young people had failed to find stability. Almost half were already living with their third family, a quarter were with their fourth family and about 20 were living with their 10th family since going into care. There was a particular need for homes to be found for vulnerable teenagers, siblings and disabled children, the study found. Carla, 23, was taken into care at the age of 12 and had eight foster homes before moving in with the Randalls. ""Looking back now I realised that the Randalls saved my life,"" she said. ""I never understood the extent of the neglect and abuse I had endured until I came to live with a 'normal' loving family. ""They were just always themselves, the smallest details meant so much to me. ""They nurtured a young, angry, untrusting teenager to become a positive, empathetic and successful young woman."" The Fostering Network said instability had a detrimental effect on the child's education and wellbeing, while finding a stable foster carer from the outset could lead to improved relationships and a happier childhood. Sara Lurie, director of the Fostering Network Scotland, said: ""As each year passes, we see more and more children coming into care. ""We need people who can open their heart, and their homes, to vulnerable children and young people and use their skills to help support them to reach their full potential. ""In particular we need people who have the skills, patience and passion to look after teenagers who may have had a really tough time and be facing some real challenges, and to offer them love, stability and security. ""A good foster carer will believe in the ambition of the children in their care in the same way they'd believe in the ambition of their biological family members."" Apologies for the delay, see below as requested. A Scottish government spokeswoman said: ""Giving young people security is paramount and we have done a great deal of work with our partners across local government and the third sector to improve how we intervene early when there is a problem within families to find appropriate solutions quickly. ""We have also expanded the age at which young people can remain in foster care as part of the continuing care provisions and the support available when they transition into independent living.""",1,4,4

David Noble, group chief executive at the Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply (CIPS), said: ""Recent fears over a stall in the UK's manufacturing sector have now become a reality. ""An atmosphere of deep unease is building throughout the manufacturing supply chain, eating away at new orders, reducing British exports and putting more jobs at risk.

No. Instead, the champion spoke of his disbelief at the ease of his victory, his gratitude that he was safe, of his thanks to promoter Eddie Hearn, manager Alex Morrison and coach Sim for believing in him, and of his desire to celebrate with a fast-food burger and 20 chicken nuggets. ""When I got in the ring after the fight, I said, 'You've done it! You've done it!',"" reported a beaming Hearn at the post-fight media conference. ""And you know what Ricky said? 'Can you get a picture with me and Michael Buffer [the legendary American boxing ring announcer]?'"" When he has time to reflect during a well-earned holiday, Burns will take immense satisfaction at being only the third British-born fighter, after Bob Fitzsimmons and Duke McKenzie, to be a three-weight world champion. In Scottish terms, his achievements must mean that he is in the very top tier of boxing greats, comfortably mentioned in the same breath as former world champions Benny Lynch, Walter McGowan, Jackie Paterson, Ken Buchanan and Jim Watt, for example. Burns' record stands at 40 wins from 46 bouts. Remarkably, 11 of those have been world title fights. Buchanan's exploits in the United States add lustre to his legacy, but while Burns may never have fought someone like Roberto Duran, should Hearn manage to set up a bout against Cincinnati's Adrien Broner, the four-time world champion stripped of the WBA title because he could not make the weight, then Burns could achieve little more in the sport. ""There are some big fights out there for me,"" said Burns. ""I want to fight the top names. I will fight anybody. I do super-lightweight comfortably and lightweight is still an option. I would fight Terence Crawford again if it came down to it. ""That's nearly two years I have been with Tony and things have just started clicking. ""I had a bit of a bad run in the last year with stuff.",1,5,4

He said he would now look at the 125 existing marine protected areas to see if further improvements could be made. The Marine Conservation Society (MCS) described it as an ""embarrassing U-turn"" for the Welsh government, and has called for better protection of seas. Creating the zones would mean a ban on fishing and anchoring in some areas and had brought opposition. The Welsh Fishermen's Association said previously that existing conservation networks for Welsh waters are adequate. The Welsh government proposed the zones last year with the backing of the Countryside Council of Wales and the Marine Conservation Society. The minister for natural resources said the decision had been made after the thousands of responses to the consultation brought ""divergent and strongly held views"". Mr Davies said to ""avoid any continuing uncertainty over the options presented in the 2012 consultation, I am also withdrawing all the proposed sites"". His comments come after the findings were published of a task and finish team which reviewed the feedback. Now, he will concentrate on the existing 125 Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) that cover 36% of Welsh seas to see if any changes can be made rather than creating additional zones. ""We are now in a stronger position to assess our current contribution to the network's ecological coherence,"" he said. ""I have, therefore, commissioned an assessment of our current MPAs to identify if there are any gaps and what the options might be to fill those gaps. ""If any measures are required, I believe they should be simple, proportionate and fit for purpose."" Dr Peter Richardson, biodiversity programme manager for MCS, said the Welsh government ""spent an awful lot of time and money and encouraged other people to put effort into this consultation response"". He said: ""70% of the consultation responses were in favour of designating these sites and yet today the minister has announced he's scrapping the whole thing... bit of an embarrassing U-turn for the government I think."" He added: ""I think there are plenty of people in the fishing industry... that understand that in order to get the best yields from the marine habitats on which they depend, they have to be managed properly.""",1,5,4

The revolution is being led by people who are using technology to share information and start a change.,"This revolution is the result of someone sending a Facebook invitation to many people. I got it like other people on our network. The buzz around it was then created on different social media websites and with videos. I was here on 25 January when riot police forced us out and by the 28th, we were back following the violence. I've been sleeping here most of the time since. Our social network was established in 2005, when there was a democratic opening around the time of the presidential elections. People from different backgrounds all met through blogging and hoped to use technology for social change. It meant we have all gained good contacts, experience and strong networks. I like to think the social network is the people itself. Things like Facebook, Twitter, SMS and phones are just social tools. When they blocked Facebook and shut down technology, our network still operated because it's about people. Internet activists are also people and a lot of our organising, social work and relationships are developed offline. This is something that people dreamt of but didn't anticipate happening in reality. If anything, it shows that all the effort we put in over the past few years has not been wasted. It has climaxed into this critical mass of people you see in the square. At the moment I'm not getting a lot of internet connection. I'm trying not to drain my phone battery. We're still using it to distribute footage people are bringing to us that we've sorted through. I hope the internet will continue to play a complementary role in activism. At the moment we physically exist in downtown Cairo and I hope that when we have finished this sit-in, we will have won the right to organise ourselves outside the internet. Twitter: Amr Gharbeia I was involved in this revolution from the first day, 25 January, and I've now been spending my nights here for a while. For the past five years, I was very active online, blogging and tweeting. As we live under emergency laws in Egypt it has been very difficult to meet or communicate except on the internet. I'd never been part of a demonstration on the ground. At first we were mocking the event on 25 January. We questioned whether it was really possible to have a ""Facebook revolution"". I came on the 25th because I felt it was my duty as a citizen and I couldn't believe how it turned into something so different from what we've seen before. I was walking among the people and weeping. Now I sometimes just tweet to update people about what's going on or to call for a million-man demonstration or a day to remember our martyrs. I'm well-known among bloggers for my long articles and constant tweets, but once I was here I stopped communicating this way so much. I felt it was totally different to have real freedom rather than just hypothetical freedom or internet freedom. Blogging and tweeting has been important as we were building our minds.

The study is published","Today, China has between 26 and 28 Hainan gibbons left, but government records that date back to the 17th Century show that gibbons were once widespread across half of the country. The apes began to disappear from the documents about 150 years ago, corresponding with population growth. The study is published in the Proceedings of the Royal Society B. Hainan gibbons are now limited to a few isolated patches of forest in the south west of China. They live in just four social groups, one of which was only discovered a few weeks ago. Understanding this population crash has been difficult, but the old government documents have helped to reveal when and how the numbers fell. Dr Sam Turvey, from the Zoological Society of London, said: ""China is one of the few places in the world that has a very very rich, long historical record. ""Because it has had such a complex bureaucracy for so long, there has been a lot of need for reporting - not just numbers of households for tax purposes and things like that, but also in terms of the kinds of natural resources that were available in the immediate environment."" These included records of animals, including gibbons, he said. ""We looked at the pattern of disappearance of gibbons through time and how that varied from place to place and the different environmental conditions and human pressures that were also present in these places."" The archives show that gibbons were a common sight in about 20 provinces in China well into the 17th and 18th Century. However, Dr Turvey said it was ""a stark contrast to their very imperilled position today"". ""We see a really steep increase in population decline and real population collapse across China about 100-150 years ago,"" he added. ""And this correlates with demographic expansion in China towards the end of the Imperial era and through the 20th Century, and the massive increase in deforestation and human population growth through the time of the Chinese Republic and the establishment of the communist party."" The researchers said a better understanding of the animals' decline would help them to establish a conservation plan for the country's last few Hainan gibbons. Dr Turvey said: ""It is an incredible privilege to be able to see gibbons in China in the wild. ""The Hainan gibbon is such as rare species, but knowing that this species is still hanging on there gives you hope that conservation will be able to bring that population back from the brink.""

The Supreme Court judges said some proposals breached rights to privacy and a family life under the European Convention on Human Rights. However, the court said the aim of the Act, which is intended to promote and safeguard the rights and wellbeing of children and young people, was legitimate. Speaking ahead of his statement to the Scottish Parliament, Mr Swinney said the Scottish government remained ""absolutely committed"" to the Named Person service as a way to support children and their families.

openai_text-ada-001 (0 shot),The article discusses the history of mead and how it has evolved over the years. It also discusses the current business opportunity for meadmakers and how it has grown over the past decade.,"But what's brewing in this new crop of commercial meaderies - as they are known - is lot more refined from the drink that once decorated tables across medieval Europe. ""Do we have any mead makers or home brewers in the group?"" asks Ben Alexander, eying a crowd of a dozen or so people who have come to his Maine Meade Works, in Portland, on a rainy Friday for a tour. When no-one raises their hand, Mr Alexander launches into the full spiel. ""If you guys want to come around, I'll show you how this thing works,"" he says, gesturing to two ceiling-high columns of stainless steel filled with something resembling a mushy golden porridge. ""We mix up honey and water over there and we pump it through a hot water bath at 160 degrees [71C] in a stainless steel coil here. Each one produces about 50 to 75 gallons [227-340 litres] of mead a day,"" explains Mr Alexander. It's fair to say he is obsessed with mead. ""It's the quintessential local beverage - you can go anywhere in the world and find honey to make mead, and I think that's unique among alcoholic beverages,"" he gushes. After being introduced to the drink by a home brewer, Mr Alexander thought there were profits to be had in a commercial meadery. He founded Maine Mead Works in 2008, pouring his savings and money from friends and family into the business. His business has since grown, along with the popularity of mead in the US. It's now a seven-person operation that manufactures more than 7,500 cases a year, shipping them as far away as China. Mr Alexander is not the only one to have caught on to the commercial potential of mead. Vicky Rowe, the owner of mead information website GotMead, says interest in the product in the US has exploded in the past decade. ""We went from 30-40 meaderies making mead to somewhere in the vicinity of 250 in the last 10 years,"" she says. ""I like to say that everything old is new again - people come back to what was good once."" Even visitors to Mr Alexander's meadery agree. Tour participant Dirk Heseman admitted that while Maine Mead Works was the first meadery he'd actually visited, he has noticed that mead ""is becoming more and more available - similar to cider"". Just this year, commercial meaderies in the US have banded together to form an industry group, the American Mead Makers Association, to better share information and encourage growth in the industry. But there's a lot of work that needs to be done to improve the image of a drink long associated with Renaissance fairs and medieval re-enactments. ""I think our number one challenge as an industry is awareness of what mead is,"" says Mr Alexander. ""You ask 10 people in a room if they've ever heard of mead, and two of them might say, 'yes', and only one of them has had a very positive experience.""

There are many people who support this move, but it is not clear how it will be done.","It was a ""good opportunity"" and ""a chance to work together,"" a top Western Sahara official told the BBC. Morocco controls two-thirds of Western Sahara and sees it as part of its historic territory. However some, including the UN, see Western Sahara as Africa's last colony. Africa Live: More on this and other stories Find out more about Western Sahara A referendum was promised in 1991 but never carried out due to wrangling over who was eligible to vote. Thousands of Sahrawi refugees still live in refugee camps in Algeria - some have been there for 40 years. It is not clear what happens next but Western Sahara is hopeful that a committee set up by the AU will address the issues that both sides have raised. Some AU delegates said that it would be easier to resolve the issue with Morocco inside the AU. Sidi Mohammed, a Western Sahara official, told the BBC that Morocco's return to the AU means that it would now be expected to put ""in practice decisions taken by the AU with regard to a referendum in Western Sahara"". Mr Mohammed dismissed the suggestion that Morocco would now seek to get the AU to change its position, saying that the no country could unilaterally change the AU fundamental agreement, saying it opposed colonisation. In his speech at the AU summit, King Mohammed VI of Morocco said the readmission was not meant to divide the continental body. No. Algeria has always been a big supporter of Western Sahara's Polisario Front and it had wanted Morocco to accept independence of the territory as a condition for readmission. Zimbabwe and South Africa were also supportive of this stance but they were outnumbered by those who wanted Morocco back in the fold. There is no specific provision in the AU charter that bars any country from joining it. Morocco simply applied and the request was accepted by more than two-thirds of the 53 members. Morocco has been involved in intense lobbying and applied in July last year to rejoin the continental body. King Mohammed toured various African countries seeking support for the bid. No. While culturally the country's identity aligns with Arab states, its economic interests increasingly lie in Africa. This is a strategic move to continue exploring its interests in mining, construction, medical, insurance and banking sectors on the continent.

The former French president, he said, ""wanted to trumpet the flights he was taking in the air campaign, despite the fact that we had wiped out all the air defences and essentially set up the entire infrastructure"" for the intervention. President Obama said the intervention ""averted large-scale civilian casualties (and) prevented what almost surely would have been a prolonged and bloody civil conflict"". But he added: ""And despite all that, Libya is a mess."" He also criticised what he called ""free riders"" in the interview, saying European and Gulf countries were calling for action against Gaddafi, adding: ""But what has been a habit over the last several decades in these circumstances is people pushing us to act but then showing an unwillingness to put any skin in the game.""

Buksh will be sentenced on 27 June. The High Court in Glasgow heard that 43-year-old Mrs Buksh died after being struck on the head at least five times. Pathologists told the court that the lack of defensive injuries and the position of her body suggested she was assaulted as she slept. Following the attack, Buksh went to Cathcart Police Station and told an officer: ""I've come to hand myself in. I think my wife's dead. I hit her on the head. I did it."" The court was told that three psychiatrists described Buksh as suffering from an acute stress disorder at the time. Prosecutor Gordon Lamont said: ""The accused and his wife had been married for 25 years, but over the last 10 or 11 years their relationship appears to have broken down and they became increasingly estranged, albeit, still residing under the one roof. ""They slept separately and Mrs Buksh routinely slept on the sofa in the living room. Their children report that they barely spoke to each other."" Mr Lamont said the problems in the marriage intensified after Mrs Buksh went to Pakistan on holiday in May last year. He said she had become involved with another man and was making plans to move to Pakistan. The court also heard that two days before he killed his wife, Buksh went to Paisley Police Office and spoke with a support officer saying he feared his wife was going to take their youngest child, aged 10, to Pakistan and not return. He also made an emergency doctor's appointment and said he was suffering from stress and not sleeping. He was prescribed medication for stress.

But despite the church's best efforts the bats are not moving and are soiling the altar and church furniture, leaving the church with an ""appalling smell"". The creatures are protected by law and cannot be wilfully disturbed. Volunteers at the church have been working for the past decade to keep the altar, stonework and woodwork clean. But the bats, roosting in the higher areas of the church continually soil the interior of the building with urine and faeces. Church warden Liz Cowley said keeping the 11th Century building in good shape was difficult. She said: ""You can see the urine marks (on the altar), they won't go away. ""If people were coming in here damaging an ancient building like this, you would say it was criminal damage. ""The smell is appalling, it's a combination of ammonia from the urine and a musty smell from the droppings that catches at the back of the throat."" Members of the church had spent Â£10,000 trying to get the bats to move and had paid for specially-built lofts nearby. The Rev Paul Mothersdale, the Rector of St Hilda's Church, said a lot of money had been invested in trying to persuade the bats to move out of the church.

Source: Crown Prosecution Service But Mr and Mrs Moores, from Chandlers Ford, Hampshire, also want the offence to be upgraded to a charge of manslaughter. Mr Moores said: ""Somebody can drive drunk and kill my son. Why is that not manslaughter? ""Nothing can prepare a parent for seeing their child in the mortuary. That will stay with me every day, every day that vision comes into my mind. ""Our life is ruined."" Mrs Moores added: ""There's nothing careless about drink driving. I don't want anybody else to feel like us."" Ms Hackett, who lived in Radnor Street, Swindon, at the time of the offence, appealed against her sentence in September 2011, but was refused. A Ministry of Justice spokesperson said: ""We are determined to make sure those who kill whilst driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs face the full force of the law. ""That is why we are consulting on plans that will see the maximum sentence for a number of offences in this area increase from 14 years to life.""

openai_text-ada-001 (0 shot),The court ruled that tax subsidies that make healthcare affordable for low-income individuals can continue in the US. This is a major part of Mr Obama's legacy and Republicans have vowed to continue fighting the law.,"In a 6-3 decision, the justices said that tax subsidies that make health insurance affordable for low-income individuals can continue. The ruling preserves the law known as Obamacare, which Mr Obama considers a major part of his presidential legacy. Republicans have vowed to continue fighting the law. ""We've got more work to do, but what we're not going to do is unravel what has now been woven into the fabric of America,"" Mr Obama said. The case, known as King v Burwell, was the second major challenge the law has faced in the US's highest court. Unlike in many other western countries, the US does not have a single-payer healthcare system. Private companies, rather than the US government, provide health insurance for US citizens. The enactment of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) - one of Mr Obama's most significant and controversial domestic achievements - in 2010 mandated that every American had to purchase private insurance. It provided the subsidies to allow many to do so. In 2012, the mandate portion of the law was challenged in the court. The justices ruled to preserve it. In that decision, as in the decision on Thursday, Chief Justice John Roberts surprised observers by siding with his liberal colleagues in support of the law. ""Congress passed the Affordable Care act to improve health insurance markets, not to destroy them,"" Chief Justice John Roberts wrote in the opinion. Justice Anthony Kennedy dissented in 2012, but sided with the majority on Thursday. Had the court made the opposite decision, an estimated 8.7 million people in the US would have been at risk of losing the aid that makes healthcare affordable. The stakes could not have been higher. People's health (crucially important) and Obama's legacy (less important, but for him and those around him fairly vital) were at stake. Well a politically finely balanced Supreme Court has given an emphatic, overwhelming vote in favour of the president by 6-3. I bet ""No-drama Obama"" is high-fiving anyone and everyone in the White House - that is how big it is. Obama defies lame-duck expectations Demonstrators gathered outside the court as early on Thursday morning. Reading updates on their mobile phones, the crowd became jubilant when they learned mid-morning that the court had ruled in their favour. Some began dancing, while others chanted ""If you're covered and you know it clap your hands."" ""This is a big sigh of relief for millions across the country,"" said Ron Pollack of Families USA, a health-care advocacy organisation. ""The ACA is not just the law of the land, it will remain the law of the land"". ""Today is a good day for healthcare in America,"" said activist Benton Strong. ""I hope this is the end of the line."" Demonstrators opposing the subsidies did not have a large visible presence. Justice Antonin Scalia wrote in his dissent that the Supreme Court is setting a precedent of favouring some laws over others. ""We should start calling this law Scotuscare"" Justice Scalia wrote, referring to the court's acronym. ""Today's interpretation is not merely unnatural; it is unheard",1,4,5

About 60% of funding is made up from Scottish Government money, with lottery sales making up the rest.","sportscotland says it has yet to decide where the cuts will fall amid concerns that elite athletes could suffer. The cuts are being blamed on reduced government spending and a drop in National Lottery ticket sales - a major contributor to sports backing. Governing bodies are bracing themselves for potential job losses. About 60% of funding is made up from Scottish Government money, with lottery sales making up the rest. In the year ending 2015, total revenue was £65.1m, which is divided up and awarded to 52 sports. By the end of next year, that figure will have fallen to £51.8m - a cut to the Scottish sporting budget of 20% in just three years. sportscotland chairman Mel Young said: ""It's heartbreaking to me because I know the effort the sport governing bodies and the community that's around it; the volunteers and the mums and dads. ""And, to have to say that we're having to cut some money back is, I believe, not the right way to go."" Former badminton player Susan Egelstaff, a double bronze medallist at the Commonwealth Games [in 2002 and 2006] and an Olympian, fears the cuts will have ""a huge impact"". ""What that means in the future is that Scotland will be constantly playing catch-up,"" she said. ""It's almost impossible to catch up if you fall too far behind the leading nations."" The Scottish Government said sport and physical activity play a ""key role"" in a healthy Scotland and that ""significant"" investment would continue in those areas. ""Having successfully delivered the Commonwealth Games [in 2014] we are now focusing on protecting or raising investment in areas intended to decrease health inequality and improve life chances, and the small reduction in the sport budget allows us to support those priorities,"" Minister for Sport Aileen Campbell said. ""There is on-going support for active lifestyles through capital investment in cycling and walking, and over the last 10 years we have invested £168m in sport infrastructure - from grassroots to the elite performance which has increased the facilities and opportunities to get people active and achieve on the world stage at both the Olympics and Commonwealth Games.""",1,4,4

A report to Norwich City Council's planning committee, which meets on Thursday, advises councillors to approve the plans.

The council agreed that new employees relocating to the city could move in temporarily ahead of demolition. However other staff, including Ms Reeves, also moved in, in contravention of council policy. The council resisted calls for a full independent inquiry.

Election officials have urged patience. Uhuru Kenyatta, who faces trial at the International Criminal Court, has been leading in early presidential results declared from Monday's tightly contested election. He is due to stand trial at The Hague next month for allegedly fuelling violence after the disputed 2007 election. He denies the charge. His closest rival is outgoing Prime Minister Raila Odinga. With provisional results in from more than 40% of polling stations earlier on Wednesday, Mr Odinga had 42% of the vote compared with Mr Kenyatta's 53%. However, Mr Odinga's allies remain confident that he will gain ground as results from his strongholds, including the Coast Province, are declared. More than 1,000 people were killed in the violence which broke out in 2007-08 after Mr Odinga claimed he had been cheated of victory by supporters of President Mwai Kibaki, who is stepping down after two terms in office. The BBC's Solomon Mugera in the capital, Nairobi, says Kenyans are becoming increasingly anxious about the delay in finalising the results. Some businesses and schools across the country have remained shut since Monday's election, he says. This has led to a shortage of goods, pushing up the prices of basic foodstuff in areas such as Kibera, the biggest slum in Nairobi and a stronghold of Mr Odinga, our correspondent adds. Uhuru Kenyatta Raila Odinga Profile: Uhuru Kenyatta Profile: Raila Odinga Some electoral officials have had to drive hundreds of kilometres to the counting centre in Nairobi to deliver paper copies of the tally of their returns. At about 13:00 local time, returning officers from only 53 of the 290 constituencies had arrived and the election commission said it would announce results from constituencies as they were ready. Its website had stopped giving updated results from the presidential race on Wednesday, and was still showing figures from Tuesday night. Our correspondent says the large number of spoiled ballots - about 6% of the total vote, well over double the number of votes cast for the third-placed candidate, Musailia Mudavadi - has become a major bone of contention. Mr Odinga's Coalition of Reforms and Democracy (Cord) wants them to be counted, but Mr Kenyatta's Jubilee Coalition is resisting this. Late on Tuesday, the election commission announced that the spoiled ballots would count in the overall vote total, increasing the likelihood of a run-off between the top two candidates, news agencies report. Mr Kenyatta's running mate William Ruto, who is also facing a trial at the ICC, said foreign embassies may have influenced such a decision. ""We want to believe that this is not an attempt to deny the Jubilee Coalition a first-round victory as is clearly now on the wall,"" he is quoted by Reuters news agency as saying.

Their intention in travelling to the region, where areas are controlled by Islamic State (IS) militants or an al-Qaeda affiliate, is not clear. The Foreign Office has said it is in contact with the Turkish authorities. The BBC's Mark Lowen said the information about the ages of the children had not been independently verified and it was too early to know where the group were intending to head to. ""Were they heading for one of the more moderate groups in Syria. Were they heading for the area controlled by al-Nusra, the al-Qaeda affiliate?

Most are thought to have volunteered as fighters for the militant Islamist group. Around half are believed to have later returned to the UK, the Metropolitan Police has said. The latest detentions come two weeks after three British teenagers were stopped from travelling into Syria from Turkey. The three - two aged 17 and one 19, from north-west London - were arrested following a tip-off from British police and flown back to the UK. They have since been released on police bail. They had flown to Turkey from Barcelona and were arrested at Sabiha Gokcen airport in Istanbul.

Information about these cases is not always made public, but the group says that going back to 1994, foreign investors have sought compensation of almost €30bn (£24bn) from 20 states. Where the results are known (a small minority of the total), the tribunals have awarded total compensation of €3.5bn (about £2.8bn). In Britain, the possible implications of this provision for the National Health Service have been especially controversial. Campaigners believe that the investor tribunals would make it harder to reverse any decisions to contract services out to international healthcare firms. John Hilary of War on Want said: TTIP ""will make it impossible for any future government to repeal the Health & Social Care Act and bring the NHS back into public hands"". The petition lists a number of other areas where its signatories believes European standards would suffer if the TTIP negotiations are completed and the Canada deal is ratified: employment, social, environmental, privacy and consumer protection. The European Commission says the EU will not have to sacrifice its high standards. It also says investor protection provisions are important for investment flows and have in general worked well. But it accepts there is a need for improvement and is trying to achieve that in its bilateral negotiations. The petition has been organised as an exercise called a European Citizens' Initiative which can lead to a public hearing in the European Parliament and require the European Commission to give a formal response explaining why it is accepting or rejecting what the petitioners call for. The European Commission has already said that the petition doesn't qualify as such an Initiative. Campaigners have launched a legal challenge to this decision.",1,5,4

The dissident republican group said they killed him because he was training new IRA officers.,"Adrian Ismay, 52, was seriously hurt after a booby-trap device exploded under his van in Belfast on 4 March. The police said that a post-mortem examination showed he died as a ""direct result of the injuries"" of the bomb. A dissident republican group, widely referred to as the new IRA, said it carried out the attack. The organisation said Mr Ismay was targeted for training officers at Maghaberry Prison near Lisburn, County Antrim. Sue McAllister, director general of the Northern Ireland Prison Service, spent time with the Ismay family on Wednesday. She said they were ""devastated and beyond shock at what's happened"". ""Like all of us, they thought that he was on the mend and was doing really well,"" said Mrs McAllister. ""We thought he would make a full recovery, we expected him to come back to work in due course, so we're all shocked, but particularly Sharon and her daughters."" Mrs McAllister condemned the behaviour of some paramilitary inmates at Maghaberry Prison, who reportedly cheered, smoked cigars and mocked wardens at the high-security jail when news of Mr Ismay's death filtered through. ""This was just unacceptable behaviour by a very small number of prisoners,"" said Mrs McAllister. ""My colleagues in Maghaberry dealt with it professionally, with great fortitude and with the courage they display on a daily basis."" She admitted she and her colleagues in the Prison Service felt ""very angry"" on hearing the reports of the celebrations in the exercise yard of the prison. ""We encounter challenging behaviour by a small number of prisoners every day, and we deal with it with great professionalism and we do not stoop to behaving that way in response,"" she added. A man appeared in court on Saturday charged in connection with the bomb attack on Mr Ismay. Det Ch Insp Richard Campbell said it was ""yet another difficult day for the Ismay family, his friends and colleagues as they struggle to come to terms with the events of the past 12 days"".

""We are also liaising with the Public Prosecution Service in relation to the individual who is currently charged with attempted murder and causing an explosion with intent to endanger life.""

The finds","The shelter - in a hollow left behind by a fallen tree - at Blick Mead was used over a 90-year period from 4336 BC, it is believed. Archaeologist David Jacques, said: ""They... used the stump of the tree, about three metres high, as a wall."" The finds are being shown to United Nations heritage experts, who are currently visiting Stonehenge. Archaeologists are concerned a planned 2.9km tunnel being considered for the nearby A303 main road will damage the site. Discoveries have also shown stones were warmed up by the Mesolithic Period inhabitants and used in a hearth to emit heat in the earthy snug. Mr Jacques, a senior research fellow at the University of Buckingham, has worked at Blick Mead for over a decade, making a number of discoveries about the inhabitants. The tree stump created a wall height similar to a ""modern bungalow"". ""They've draped probably animal skins or thatch around the basin and connected it to a post so it's a very comfortable snug little place,"" he said. The wooden wall of the hollow was lined with flints and the large earthy pit created by the tree root lined with cobbles and decorated with ""exotic"" stones from outside the area. ""There are some clever and sophisticated things going on, the hot stones that they put into this little type of alcove wouldn't have been on fire,"" explained Mr Jacques. ""It looks more like these people have been using these hot stones as a type of storage heater so that you've got a lot of warmth coming off them."" Mr Jacques will meet the UN experts later to ask for the route to be moved closer to Salisbury and for hydrological assessments to be made. ""It's very likely the water flow would be reduced in and around the site,"" he said. ""It would take out all the organics and destroy all the animal bone we've been finding which is crucial for finding where they have been living and for getting radiocarbon dates from all the organics like pollen and wood. ""This is massively important for reconstructing what the landscape would have looked like."" Andy Rhind-Tutt, former mayor and chairman of Amesbury Museum and Heritage Trust said: ""I sincerely hope the team delivering the long-awaited A303 improvement look seriously at an alternative alignment south of Salisbury and away from this unequalled archaeological landscape. ""It would be criminal to destroy such a rich heritage and connection with our ancestors for the sake of blocking the view to the passing public of Stonehenge.""",1,4,4

Wrockwardine Wood and Sutherland academies, also run by the Telford Co-operative Multi-Academy Trust, were put in special measures earlier this week. The trust has not commented. Ofsted criticised the trust's lack of support to the schools and said each was now considering an alternative sponsor. Inspectors said pupils' achievement at the Phoenix Academy had dropped since it became an academy in 2013 and their latest report rated it inadequate in all areas. A report in 2013, before it converted, rated the secondary school as ""requiring improvement"", while Lakeside was rated ""good"" in 2012 under its former name the Lord Silkin School. In the latest report, inspectors said the curriculum at Phoenix Academy was ""inadequate"", while ""weak teaching"" meant pupils were not sufficiently challenged and were often ""disengaged and disruptive"". There was particular criticism of standards in English and maths which the watchdog said were limiting pupils' achievements in other areas. Ofsted's report said governors, managers and teachers had developed a ""culture of low expectations"", while leaders had failed to act decisively to halt the decline in pupils' achievement. There was, however, some praise for the acting head teacher. Inspectors said he had introduced a number of improvement measures and some were ""beginning to have an impact"". A report on Lakeside School highlighted similar concerns, criticising teachers for not sufficiently challenging pupils and for having ""over generous"" predictions of their achievement. Inspectors said many pupils, whether high achievers or those with special educational needs, were ""not making the progress they should"" and achievements at GCSE were well below the national average. Governors were also criticised for not holding leaders to account, while the report said management had failed to effectively monitor either pupils or teachers. Inspectors, did however highlight new initiatives to improve literacy which they said were ""beginning to have a positive impact"".",1,4,4

The article also says that the type of weapons used and connection to dissident republicans are being investigated.,"A ""terrorist hide"" was uncovered at Capanagh Forest near Larne after two members of the public found suspicious objects in the woods on Saturday. Some of the items found included an armour-piercing improvised rocket and two anti-personnel mines. The main line of police inquiry is the arms belonged to dissident republicans. Last week, Home Secretary Theresa May said MI5 believed an attack on targets in Great Britain by dissident republicans had become ""a strong possibility"". Analysis: Vincent Kearney, BBC News NI's home affairs correspondent The discovery of what appears to be a second dissident republican arms dump near Larne within three months has left police baffled. Based on location alone, the analysis would be that the items found most likely belonged to loyalist paramilitaries. But the nature of what was found suggests otherwise and the finger of suspicion firmly in the direction of dissident republicans. Det Supt Kevin Geddes said the threat level in Northern Ireland from dissident republican groups remains ""severe"" and an attack is ""highly likely"". Police officers found three barrels hidden in holes in the forest. As well as rockets and mines, there were also several pipe bombs, assault rifle ammunition and parts to construct a ""substantial number of explosive devices"". Det Supt Geddes said the seizure was significant ""both in terms of its size and its capability"". ""A number of these devices were ready to be deployed,"" he added. ""This seizure has undoubtedly saved lives."" He said the type of weapons that had been found meant police would focus their investigation on dissident republicans. In March, an arms find was made at Carnfunnock Country Park near Larne, and police said the were investigating a connection between the two discoveries. ""There are links in terms of the general location and the manner and method of storage and packaging of these munitions,"" Det Supt Geddes said. He added that police are ""indebted"" to the two people who noticed the suspicious objects in the Capanagh Forest.",1,4,4

Internet companies will also be required to allow Russian authorities access to users' information. One human rights group called the move ""draconian"". The law was approved by Russia's upper house of parliament in April. It includes measures to ensure that bloggers cannot remain anonymous, and states that social networks must maintain six months of data on its users. The information must be stored on servers based in Russian territory, so that government authorities can gain access. Critics see it as the latest in a series of recent moves to curb internet freedom. Hugh Williamson, of New York-based Human Rights Watch, has called the law ""another milestone in Russia's relentless crackdown on free expression"". ""The internet is the last island of free expression in Russia and these draconian regulations are clearly aimed at putting it under government control,"" he added. Opposition figures have used the internet to air their views, with some gaining millions of followers. Commentators opposing Vladimir Putin often face restrictions in broadcast outlets and newspapers. Analysis: Famil Ismailov, news editor, BBCRussian.com Russian bloggers are bracing themselves for the moment when Russia's new ""information security law"" comes into force on 1 August. Some already share advice on how to use proxy servers in order to access social media sites that, in their view, are under threat of being closed. It is hard to see how the law will be enforced. The servers for most of the popular social media platforms that many Russians use are based outside Russia. Many popular bloggers are already looking for, and apparently finding, ways to ""cheat"" the feature that counts page visits and keep their daily unique visitor numbers just under 3000, or to make sure that the statistics are hidden altogether. Anton Nossik, who is considered Russia's ""internet guru"", wrote in his LiveJournal blog that the new law didn't threaten individual bloggers directly, but provided legal grounds to block popular social networks like Facebook, Twitter, LiveJournal and Google. ""The issue of banning all these platforms in Russia is a political one and it will be decided by only one person"", Mr Nossik wrote, with a thinly veiled reference to President Vladimir Putin. Earlier in the year, Russia enacted a law that gave the government powers to block websites without explanation. In March, Moscow blocked the blog of Mr Navalny, along with two news sites and a organisation run by Garry Kasparov - a vocal critic of the Russian government. In a statement, Russia's prosecutor general's office said the blocks were imposed because of the sites' role in helping stage illegal protests. Earlier this week, Twitter blocked access to an anti-Kremlin account that often publishes leaked government documents, following a request by Russia's federal communications agency Roskomnadzor. For many years, Russia had relatively lax internet laws. However Moscow has recently changed its tune, with Mr Putin branding the internet an ongoing ""CIA project"". He also claimed that",1,4,3

The murder, filmed on CCTV and on mobile phones, sparked outrage. The Church of the Almighty God cult is banned in China but claims to have millions of members. Following the brutal killing in May, Chinese authorities said that they detained hundreds of members of the cult, reports the BBC's Martin Patience in Beijing. Interviewed in prison later, one of the defendants, Zhang Lidong showed no remorse. He said: ""I beat her with all my might and stamped on her too. She was a demon. We had to destroy her."" The group had entered a small McDonalds branch in Zhaoyuan in Shandong province last May soliciting phone numbers and hoping to recruit members to their cult. Ms Wu was waiting in the restaurant with her seven-year-old son and when she refused to give her number, an act which prompted the beating while they screamed at other diners to keep away or they would face the same fate. The public face of the Church of the Almighty God is a website full of uplifting hymns and homilies. But its core belief is that God has returned to earth as a Chinese woman to wreak the apocalypse. The only person who claims direct contact with this god is a former physics teacher, Zhao Weishan, who founded the cult 25 years ago and has since fled to the United States, says BBC China Editor Carrie Gracie. No-one knows exactly where he is, but much of the website's message of outright hostility to the Chinese government is delivered in English as well as Chinese.

State media picked up the story on Thursday, which was first reported in a local evening paper earlier this week. Liaoshen Wanbao reported the 49-year-old woman in Shenyang city had claimed her husband had divorced her 10 years ago because he disliked the shape of her face, said to be ""large and square"" with ""fat cheeks"". She said it spurred her to undergo facial surgery three times at a local hospital to shave her jawbones and reshape her face into a slimmer shape. During the third surgery the doctors discovered that if they proceeded further her nerves may be damaged, and halted the procedure. The woman, identified only by her surname Wang, later sued the hospital for 1.7 million yuan ($260,900; Â£183,900) in damages. She alleged the surgery had left her with soreness in her chin, and she could only eat and drink through a straw as ""when she exerted force on her lower jaw, she had the sensation that it would break"". The hospital, however, argued that the surgeries were conducted according to regulations, and pointed out that they encouraged her to seek psychiatric help instead of a third operation, which she refused. After mediation the woman agreed to accept 20,000 yuan ($3,100, Â£2,200) as compensation, said the report. On Weibo, some condemned the woman's husband, but others also chastised the woman. One top-voted comment read: ""It's purely an excuse, if her face was large then why did he decide to marry her in the first place? If he stopped loving her then he should have just said so."" It continued: ""This woman is also very silly to have believed that her face shape was the real reason for the divorce, she is lying to herself."" Said another Weibo user: ""Even if you had gone for facial surgery and made your face smaller, he would still have found other reasons to divorce you."" One person noted the sharp difference in the compensation amount and voiced suspicions: ""1.7 million was dropped to 20,000, it makes me wonder if she really did have a problem with her jaw."" Still others took the opportunity to crack jokes. ""What an odd reason for divorce! I wonder how square was this woman's square-shaped face? Like a television set? Microwave oven?"" Plastic surgery has long been a hot topic on Weibo. In December, users similarly expressed outrage when a Chinese man took out a newspaper advertisement pleading for his wife to go for plastic surgery.

""In a lifetime of pretty much impossible things that have happened to our band, this is the highlight,"" said frontman Win Butler. Earlier, every stage at the event was closed after lightning struck ground. Dance act Rudimental were escorted off the main stage mid-set, and had to abandon their planned encore - Feel The Love, with guest vocalist John Newman. ""We're quite upset,"" musician Amir Amor told the BBC, ""but we had a great time anyway"". Metallica's Lars Ulrich was flying into the site by helicopter as the storm descended. ""It was kind of frightening,"" he said. ""When we landed, all the people picking us up were going, 'we didn't expect you were going to fly in this weather'. ""But the pilot didn't say anything about that. We saw the lightning up there. I thought it was pyrotechnics for Arcade Fire."" The thunderstorm heralded a brief but torrential downpour, and the power cut took BBC coverage off the air. Music resumed on the main stage at 19:00 BST with Lily Allen, who dedicated an expletive-laden song to FIFA president Sepp Blatter. Other performers on Friday included Blondie, who proved so popular it became impossible to enter or leave The Other Stage at lunchtime, and Paolo Nutini, whose soulful ballads were a fitting soundtrack as dusk fell over Somerset. Sophie Ellis-Bextor sneaked some disco into her set at the largely-acoustic Avalon Stage, while the pulsing synthpop of Glaswegian band Chvrches made for a steamy atmosphere in the John Peel tent as fans danced off the downpour. Arcade Fire took to the stage shortly after 22:00 BST, their arrival heralded by a man dressed from head-to-toe in a mirrored suit. Bravely, considering the weather conditions, the 12-piece band were largely dressed in white, but if they were worried about laundry bills, it didn't show. They threw themselves around the stage, thrashing and spinning as though plagued by a swarm of invisible bees, each member switching instruments between - and often during - songs. As well as guitars, they played steel drums, xylophones and even a hurdy gurdy. Frontman Win Butler made frequent excursions into the audience and, during the song Flashbulb Eyes, plucked a camera from a press photographer and carried it on stage to capture the band's performance. The set list was evenly spread across their four albums, with highlights including No Cars Go, Neighborhood #1 (Tunnels) and Rebellion (Lies). The group's recurring subject matter of suburban despair and alienation might have seemed like an odd fit for Glastonbury's peace and love ethos, but there is an optimism and belief in humanity at the core of their music. Plus, they have really catchy choruses.

Archaeologist David Jacques, said: ""They... used the stump of the tree, about three metres high, as a wall."" The finds are being shown to United Nations heritage experts, who are currently visiting Stonehenge. Archaeologists are concerned a planned 2.9km tunnel being considered for the nearby A303 main road will damage the site. Discoveries have also shown stones were warmed up by the Mesolithic Period inhabitants and used in a hearth to emit heat in the earthy snug. Mr Jacques, a senior research fellow at the University of Buckingham, has worked at Blick Mead for over a decade, making a number of discoveries about the inhabitants. The tree stump created a wall height similar to a ""modern bungalow"". ""They've draped probably animal skins or thatch around the basin and connected it to a post so it's a very comfortable snug little place,"" he said. The wooden wall of the hollow was lined with flints and the large earthy pit created by the tree root lined with cobbles and decorated with ""exotic"" stones from outside the area. ""There are some clever and sophisticated things going on, the hot stones that they put into this little type of alcove wouldn't have been on fire,"" explained Mr Jacques. ""It looks more like these people have been using these hot stones as a type of storage heater so that you've got a lot of warmth coming off them."" Mr Jacques will meet the UN experts later to ask for the route to be moved closer to Salisbury and for hydrological assessments to be made. ""It's very likely the water flow would be reduced in and around the site,"" he said. ""It would take out all the organics and destroy all the animal bone we've been finding which is crucial for finding where they have been living and for getting radiocarbon dates from all the organics like pollen and wood. ""This is massively important for reconstructing what the landscape would have looked like."" Andy Rhind-Tutt, former mayor and chairman of Amesbury Museum and Heritage Trust said: ""I sincerely hope the team delivering the long-awaited A303 improvement look seriously at an alternative alignment south of Salisbury and away from this unequalled archaeological landscape.

The Blick Mead site is about 1.5 miles (2.4km) from Stonehenge and archaeologists said ""scientifically tested charcoal"" dug up from the site had ""revealed that it dated from around 4000 BC"". David Jacques said the dig had also found ""evidence of feasting"" including burnt flints, tools and remains of giant cattle, known as aurochs, which were eaten by early hunter gatherers. Mr Jacques said: ""British pre-history may have to be rewritten. This is the latest dated Mesolithic encampment ever found in the UK. ""Blick Mead site connects the early hunter gatherer groups returning to Britain after the Ice Age to the Stonehenge area, all the way through to the Neolithic in the late 5th Millennium BC. ""But our only chance to find out about the earliest chapter of Britain's history could be wrecked if the tunnel goes ahead."" Andy Rhind-Tutt, a former mayor and current chairman of Amesbury Museum, which part-funded the dig, said the discovery could ""provide what archaeologists have been searching for centuries - the answer to the story of the pre-history of Stonehenge.""

Buksh's amnesia is genuine and he did not know why he killed his wife.","Asghar Buksh, 55, repeatedly struck mother-of-six Nasreen Buksh over the head with a heavy blunt object which has never been found. He admitted culpable homicide on the basis of diminished responsibility after saying he had no recollection of the killing at Dixon Avenue, Glasgow, on 24 September last year. Buksh will be sentenced on 27 June. The High Court in Glasgow heard that 43-year-old Mrs Buksh died after being struck on the head at least five times. Pathologists told the court that the lack of defensive injuries and the position of her body suggested she was assaulted as she slept. Following the attack, Buksh went to Cathcart Police Station and told an officer: ""I've come to hand myself in. I think my wife's dead. I hit her on the head. I did it."" The court was told that three psychiatrists described Buksh as suffering from an acute stress disorder at the time. Prosecutor Gordon Lamont said: ""The accused and his wife had been married for 25 years, but over the last 10 or 11 years their relationship appears to have broken down and they became increasingly estranged, albeit, still residing under the one roof. ""They slept separately and Mrs Buksh routinely slept on the sofa in the living room. Their children report that they barely spoke to each other."" Mr Lamont said the problems in the marriage intensified after Mrs Buksh went to Pakistan on holiday in May last year. He said she had become involved with another man and was making plans to move to Pakistan. The court also heard that two days before he killed his wife, Buksh went to Paisley Police Office and spoke with a support officer saying he feared his wife was going to take their youngest child, aged 10, to Pakistan and not return. He also made an emergency doctor's appointment and said he was suffering from stress and not sleeping. He was prescribed medication for stress. Defence counsel Sarah Livingstone said: ""My client has no memory of this incident. His amnesia is absolutely genuine. ""This is not a case where this man was a bad husband, there was no domestic abuse. This was an unhappy marriage, but however, unhappy it was it didn't justify killing his wife. ""He suffered an acute stress reaction. Three psychiatrists all agree that he was suffering from an abnormality of the mind.""

If a deal cannot be struck, the business may still have to be liquidated.","BHS entered administration in April. Since then, efforts have been continuing to rescue it from closure and save the jobs of its 11,000 staff. Last week, a surprise late bid led by retail veteran Greg Tufnell transformed the race to acquire the retailer. His team, said to be backed by Portuguese money, is the front-runner. But if a deal cannot be struck, the business may still have to be liquidated. The remaining bidders have faded into the background. Another consortium led by Matalan tycoon John Hargreaves and Turkish retail entrepreneur Cafer Mahiroglu has reportedly run into difficulties, while other suitors have apparently failed to impress with their proposals. Some of those involved in the different bids have impressive retailing histories. But then Sir Philip Green, who controlled BHS from 2000 to 2015, also had a brilliant track record. And he ended up selling the business for Â£1. So what are the chances of saving BHS from the liquidators? And just who are the people aiming to do it? In the public eye, Greg Tufnell is easily overshadowed by his more famous brother Phil, the former England cricketer. But that could change if his bid for BHS is successful, because he hopes to become the firm's next chairman. And as far as his credentials for the job are concerned, the 54-year-old executive certainly talks the talk. He describes himself as ""a highly experienced managing director with Mothercare and Arcadia, a blend of entrepreneur, strategist and hands-on operator with significant commercial business turnaround, acquisition and fund-raising experience"". His record shows that he was buying and merchandising director at Next from 1991 to 1994. He then spent three years as managing director of menswear retailer Burton, part of the Arcadia group, followed by another three years as managing director of Mothercare. He currently appears to occupy a portfolio of different jobs, including the chairmanships of leather accessories brand Zatchels and recruitment consultancy hga Group. Earlier this month, he registered a new firm, Richess Group, at Companies House. Its other directors are Nick de Scossa, a Swiss banker, and Lisbon-based entrepreneur Jose Maria Soares Bento. Until Mr Tufnell's bid turned up, many observers had assumed that BHS would be snapped up by Matalan founder Mr Hargreaves. But it appears that the cost of a deal may have proved too high. Sources say Mr Hargreaves was asked to improve his offer and balked. Like Sir Philip Green, 71-year-old John Hargreaves also enjoys the life of the super-rich. He has an estimated fortune of Â£1bn, according to the Sunday Times Rich List. But in stark contrast to the ebullient Sir Philip, Mr Hargreaves is described by industry insiders as quiet-spoken, someone who shuns the limelight. Mr Hargreaves is no longer directly involved in the business he founded. He sold his 69% stake in Matalan in 2000, then in 2006 took it private through Missouri Bidco, a company 53.5% owned by him and his family.

He describes himself as a ""one-man melting pot"". He first made a name for himself in journalism, including a stint as Brussels correspondent for the right-wing Daily Telegraph newspaper and editor of The Spectator magazine. His humorous persona led him to become a fixture on various television programmes, including the satirical BBC panel show Have I Got News For You. He still has a lucrative and entertaining column in the Daily Telegraph, in which august forum he explained the reasons for his decision on the EU. As a politician, he has been a Conservative member of parliament for two constituencies, Henley from 2001 to 2008 and then Uxbridge and South Ruislip from 2015. Lest you think he was putting his feet up between parliamentary mandates, he is also currently serving the second of two terms as mayor of London, no mean feat in a city where the centre-left Labour Party has dominated in recent decades. That's indicative of the position Mr Johnson has carved out for himself as one of the most charismatic politicians in the UK who has wide appeal beyond Conservative heartlands - polling has suggested that his stance on the EU referendum may sway some undecided voters. Just look what happens when you type his name into Google.co.uk. Not quite. He has previously courted controversy for his remarks about (among others) the populations of Liverpool, Portsmouth and Papua New Guinea, not to mention run-ins with his own party leadership and TV chef Jamie Oliver. Last October he accidentally flattened a 10-year-old schoolboy at what was meant to be a friendly game of photo-op rugby in Japan.

Eight councils - Glasgow, East Renfrewshire, Renfrewshire, Inverclyde, North and South Lanarkshire and East and West Dunbartonshire - are involved. The City Deal scheme will see Westminster and Holyrood give £500m each in additional grant funding to the eight council areas. The councils will supplement this by borrowing £130m. Councillors from across all eight areas will meet to discuss some of the schemes. Several of the projects being discussed later are in East Renfrewshire, where £44m is expected to be invested over the next few years, with much of the money coming from the City Deal funding. One is a water sports park at the Dams to Darnley Country Park. It would open in 2017 and include a centre offering wakeboarding, the fastest-growing extreme sport in the world. A new railway station in Barrhead and sliproad from the M77 would serve an area which could become one of East Renfrewshire's fastest growth areas. The council expects 1,000 new homes to be built there. Another project would transform the Levern Works site in Barrhead. A site formerly occupied by Nestle, where pet food was once made, would be cleared. The site will then be marketed for development for a range of uses that will bring new jobs to Barrhead. A wide range of other infrastructure projects across the eight council areas will also be discussed.",1,4,4

""In future I will be better - definitely,"" said the former Barcelona and Bayern Munich coach. ""This season has been a massive lesson for me."" He added: ""We have a lot of beautiful things to fight for and to qualify for the Champions League will be a huge success. But we have to be honest with ourselves. We were not good enough to compete for the Premier League [title]."" Defeat at Stamford Bridge left City just four points ahead of Arsenal and Manchester United, both of whom have a game in hand. With the FA Cup being City's only realistic chance of winning a trophy this term, it is likely to be the worst season of Guardiola's managerial career. The 46-year-old has never gone a single season without winning a trophy - he has won the title in six out of seven attempts and his sides have always reached the last four of the Champions League. Guardiola has also responded to questions about a row between City and Chelsea coaching staff at Stamford Bridge following the defeat on Wednesday night. There have been conflicting claims about the precise nature of the row, but stewards were needed to calm the situation down after Chelsea's 2-1 win. The incident centred around a disagreement between Chelsea fitness coach Paolo Bertelli and Manchester City masseur Mark Sertori, both of whom speak Italian, as the Premier League leaders celebrated their victory. Guardiola said: ""We are so polite in our defeats and we are so polite when we win. When we win, normally we celebrate a little bit, then we go to the locker room. Chelsea manager Antonio Conte was not involved and has played the incident down. He said: ""Respect is the most important thing in football.""",1,5,4

""Do we have any mead makers or home brewers in the group?"" asks Ben Alexander, eying a crowd of a dozen or so people who have come to his Maine Meade Works, in Portland, on a rainy Friday for a tour. When no-one raises their hand, Mr Alexander launches into the full spiel. ""If you guys want to come around, I'll show you how this thing works,"" he says, gesturing to two ceiling-high columns of stainless steel filled with something resembling a mushy golden porridge. ""We mix up honey and water over there and we pump it through a hot water bath at 160 degrees [71C] in a stainless steel coil here. Each one produces about 50 to 75 gallons [227-340 litres] of mead a day,"" explains Mr Alexander. It's fair to say he is obsessed with mead. ""It's the quintessential local beverage - you can go anywhere in the world and find honey to make mead, and I think that's unique among alcoholic beverages,"" he gushes. After being introduced to the drink by a home brewer, Mr Alexander thought there were profits to be had in a commercial meadery. He founded Maine Mead Works in 2008, pouring his savings and money from friends and family into the business. His business has since grown, along with the popularity of mead in the US. It's now a seven-person operation that manufactures more than 7,500 cases a year, shipping them as far away as China. Mr Alexander is not the only one to have caught on to the commercial potential of mead. Vicky Rowe, the owner of mead information website GotMead, says interest in the product in the US has exploded in the past decade. ""We went from 30-40 meaderies making mead to somewhere in the vicinity of 250 in the last 10 years,"" she says. ""I like to say that everything old is new again - people come back to what was good once."" Even visitors to Mr Alexander's meadery agree. Tour participant Dirk Heseman admitted that while Maine Mead Works was the first meadery he'd actually visited, he has noticed that mead ""is becoming more and more available - similar to cider"". Just this year, commercial meaderies in the US have banded together to form an industry group, the American Mead Makers Association, to better share information and encourage growth in the industry. But there's a lot of work that needs to be done to improve the image of a drink long associated with Renaissance fairs and medieval re-enactments. ""I think our number one challenge as an industry is awareness of what mead is,"" says Mr Alexander. ""You ask 10 people in a room if they've ever heard of mead, and two of them might say, 'yes', and only one of them has had a very positive experience."" The mead of the past was often sweet, and didn't appeal to many drinkers",1,5,4

Freezing care provider fees to save money was no long sustainable, it said. Ministers say extra money will help NHS and social care services work together. The survey, which was completed by 147 directors of adult social services for councils in England, suggests that funding reductions to social care budgets have totalled £4.6bn since 2010 - a 31% overall reduction. Budgets for adult social care - which provides practical support to people due to illness, disability, old age or a low income - will reduce by a further £500m in cash terms this year, it said. ""Taking the growth in numbers of older and disabled people into account, this means that an additional £1.1bn would be needed to provide the same level of service as last year,"" the report warned. It said some councils had made savings in the past by freezing fees paid to providers, but care providers were now also facing financial problems. Some companies - particularly those in southern England - are struggling to attract staff, amid increasing concern about the quality of care, it said. ""What is at stake is the continuing capacity of adult social care to sustain services to those in greatest need,"" ADASS president Ray James said. ""In virtually all our authorities, the number in need is growing, while the complexity of their needs is increasing."" ADASS called for the government to ""protect essential care and support services to the most vulnerable members of our community"". But a government spokesman said the survey ""ignores"" a commitment to invest £10bn in health services that are being ""joined up"" with social care, by 2020. The BBC has launched an online guide to the care system for the over-65s. The ""care calculator"" covers residential care and the support provided in people's own homes, for tasks such as washing and dressing. Users can submit their postcode and find out how much each service costs where they live in the UK. There is also a dedicated BBC Cost of Care website, with news stories, analysis and video. The spokesman said: ""Increasing budgets isn't the only solution. By working innovatively and joining up health and social care we can improve care and also save money."" However, Councillor Izzi Seccombe, from the Local Government Association (LGA), said adult social care services were facing ""enormous pressures"" due to ""insufficient funding, growing demand and escalating costs"". ""We have long warned that investing in the NHS whilst social care budgets are under continual pressure is simply a false economy. ""It is social care services that support elderly and vulnerable people to maintain their independence, live in their own community and stay out of hospital longer,"" she added.

openai_text-curie-001,"Cuts to local government funding are causing problems for councils across the UK, with Leicestershire being one of the worst hit.","Byron Rhodes is taking me around the modern council headquarters. It's full of light. It's busy. The building has regenerated the area around Melton Mowbray's railway station, once a muddy pot-holed piece of wasteland where those in the know parked for free. Now the council offices link the station to a park and the town centre. It was partly paid for with insurance money after a fire destroyed the old offices on the other side of town. A supermarket moved in to replace it and helped with the money too, putting the council on a firm financial footing. But that was four years ago and the crisis is a different one today. It's being experienced by all local authorities - cuts in central government funding which threaten the services they provide. Mr Rhodes is also deputy leader of Leicestershire County Council, with responsibility for finance. Leicestershire is historically the poorest funded council in the country because of a quirk of Whitehall recalculations, going back a quarter of a century since the poll tax, or community charge, was scrapped. At the moment councils get income from council tax, a share of the business rates, any income they generate themselves from services plus a grant from central government. It's the grant cut which is causing them grief. What's called the ""core funding"" is worked out by the number of homes multiplied by a set amount. And each authority has a different value set per dwelling. If we look at Surrey, which is top of the table, the amount will be £1,686 by 2019/20. Nottinghamshire is mid-table at £1,482, Derbyshire is in the lower reaches with £1,422 per dwelling and then comes Leicestershire at £1,354. ""The funding system is chaotic,"" says Byron Rhodes. ""It doesn't reflect real need. Look at Oxfordshire which is an interesting example,"" he says with a glint in his eye. Could he possibly be referring to the prime ministerial plea to the county council about cutbacks to services there? ""If we had the same funding as Oxfordshire, we'd have £50m a year extra. If we had the same as Surrey, we'd have £100m more. We'd be partying everyday if we had that kind of money."" Leicestershire have been helped with a small share of what's been called transitional funding - about £300m to help councils following pressure from Conservative MPs. Think back to the vote on Sunday trading. With a majority of only 17 in the Commons, the Conservatives lost the vote when 20 odd rebelled. Last month there would've been another rebellion, including some of our own Tory MPs in the East Midlands, if something wasn't done to improve the local government finance settlement over the next four years. The money has gone largely to shire counties. Leicestershire got £6.6m spread over two years, enough to save some services from closure. But it's a drop in the ocean for an authority with a £19m black hole in the budget every year after the latest cutbacks. Labour have protested that 83% of the councils getting transition funding are Conservative-run. Many Labour-run",1,5,4

Needing 99 to win, England sent out Jos Buttler and Ben Stokes in the top four. But they were eventually beaten by the fading light, finishing 25 runs short of a famous victory on 74-4. The tourists could not find the boundary frequently enough before the umpires brought the teams off, with Joe Root 33 not out. However, this was a hugely impressive performance from England and one that will fill them with confidence ahead of the second Test in Dubai, which begins on Thursday. After England concluded their innings on 598-9 in the morning, Pakistan looked assured at 113-3 shortly after tea, leading by 38 with seven second-innings wickets remaining. But the match turned when veteran batsman Younus Khan, playing in his 102nd Test match, mistimed a wild heave to give Rashid his first Test wicket - caught at point by Stokes. Rashid - whose figures in the first innings were the worst ever by a debutant - then quickly added a second victim, having Asad Shafiq caught behind for six. The door was opened for England, and Rashid and Moeen Ali barged through it as they polished off the last five wickets for 14 runs. Pakistan skipper Misbah ul-Haq - who had played with restraint for his 51 - inexplicably aimed an uncharacteristic slog at Moeen and was bowled. Moeen then removed Wahab Riaz caught behind, before Rashid claimed the final three wickets - all superbly caught at first slip by James Anderson. England sensed an unlikely victory, but their reorganised batting order could not score quickly enough as Pakistan's tactic of spin from both ends and fielders on the boundary brought them regular wickets. Makeshift opener Buttler was trapped lbw for four, Moeen and Stokes were caught on the boundary in quick succession, and Jonny Bairstow was stumped attempting a big shot. However, in truth it was mistakes earlier in the match that ultimately proved more costly as England fell just short of their first win on the subcontinent since beating India in Kolkata in 2012. In Pakistan's first innings, Ian Bell dropped Mohammad Hafeez (98) and Shafiq (107) at slip early in their innings. And Shoaib Malik, who made 245, was dismissed off a no-ball by Stuart Broad.

Lennon saw the vacancy as an opportunity, and that was enough to encourage Hibs that a figure of his profile and experience would accept a role in the Championship. Even though his last job in Scotland involved leading a team on Champions League duty, Lennon's mind has not been swayed by haughtiness. The appointment of the former Celtic manager as successor to Alan Stubbs suits both parties, because it is mutually beneficial. Success is alluring, and Hibs offer Lennon the chance to accumulate more achievements. He was immediately engaged in crisis management at his previous club Bolton, but will find stability, potential and accomplishment at Easter Road. The demand will be to deliver promotion, but that will not seem daunting when the majority of the squad that pushed Rangers for a while last season then won the Scottish Cup is still in place. Lennon's task is to refine and bolster the team, when new managers are often faced with a period of overhaul. Stubbs left the club on an emotional high after delivering their first Scottish Cup in 114 years, but before the final against Rangers there was a tangible sense of exasperation that promotion had been missed. Hibs were entitled to feel that it was an unnecessary failure given their circumstances. The club is about to embark on a third season in the Championship, but by most other measures they can be considered a top-flight outfit. The budget will be significantly more than the rest of the teams in the division, the training ground at East Mains and facilities are first-class, the football side of the business is stable and well-run by George Craig, the club's head of football operations, the squad is full of talent. Lennon can rely on consistently assured performances from the likes of David Gray, Darren McGregor, Paul Hanlon, Lewis Stevenson, John McGinn, Fraser Fyvie, Dylan McGeouch, James Keatings and Jason Cummings. Some minor issues remain, such as who will fill the goal next season, but the challenge is more on adding depth and strength of will to the squad and man-management. McGinn, one of the most reliably effective players in the Championship last season, has already insisted that he remains committed to Hibs despite the failure to achieve promotion. The 21-year-old midfielder provides the kind of industry and spirit that a team can be built around. There may be critical decisions to make, though, since Cummings is entering the final year of his contract and so represents a sellable asset. He is a regular goalscorer, though, and Stubbs had to sign Anthony Stokes on loan last January to provide some support up front.

The Foreign Office has said it is in contact with the Turkish authorities. The BBC's Mark Lowen said the information about the ages of the children had not been independently verified and it was too early to know where the group were intending to head to.

openai_text-curie-001,GP practices are being paid to help local NHS groups limit the number of patient referrals and cut costs.,"GP practices are being paid to help local NHS groups limit the number of patient referrals and cut costs, the doctors' magazine Pulse found. Appointments affected include scans and consultations with specialists - including those for cancer patients. The British Medical Association said such incentives were ""misguided"". At least nine clinical commissioning groups (CCGs) were offering GP practices payments for hitting targets, according to Pulse's investigation. In one case, Birmingham South Central CCG was offering practices more than Â£11,000 to reduce new outpatient attendances, follow-ups, A&E attendances and emergency admissions by 1%, compared with 2014/15. It said the schemes, which exclude cancer referrals, were designed to ""incentivise best quality practice"" and ""drive improvements in the quality of primary medical care"". ""Our priority is to ensure that patients have access to services that they need, when they need them,"" said a spokesperson for Birmingham South Central CCG. Another CCG told Pulse it had considered the ""full impact"" of the incentive scheme and was ""confident that there is no conflict of interest"". Pulse said that one scheme had already been looked at by the General Medical Council, the body which regulates medical standards in the UK, after local GP leaders expressed their concern. The magazine pointed out that initial hospital referrals for cancer patients should happen within two weeks of a GP first suspecting the condition. Dr Chand Nagpaul, chairman of the GPs committee of the doctors' trade union the British Medical Association, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that such schemes were a ""financial contaminant"" to patient-doctor trust. He said: ""It's short-sighted and misguided of CCGs to introduce such mechanisms, because they do lead to the potential for patients questioning the motives of GP referrals. ""We believe it is far more appropriate for CCGs to introduce clinical pathways that ensure patients are referred appropriately rather than these crude, salesman-like bonuses which pay GPs simply to make reduction to referrals in numerical terms."" Dr Peter Melton is local GP and clinical chief officer for North East Lincolnshire CCG, which offers the equivalent of more than Â£6,000 to practices that reduce outpatient referrals to the same level as the 25% with the lowest referral rates (which include two-week urgent cancer referrals) in 2014/15. He said the CCG was already among the best in England for referring suspected cancer patients to a consultant within two weeks and the scheme was not about avoiding sending people to hospital. ""It is not focussing on referral reduction per se but on better clinical and quality standards for the patient,"" he explained. ""The expectation is practices will be encouraged to investigate more locally and monitor the patient in the first instance rather than automatically refer in to a secondary care service."" Analysis by the BBC's Helen Briggs The NHS is under pressure to make savings, with a target of carving out Â£22bn of efficiency savings by 2020. NHS leaders want to cut patient referrals that are deemed inappropriate, particularly when patients could be cared for locally.

She has a high standard to live up to - notably Prince's show in 2007, which took place in the middle of a Miami thunderstorm and is widely accepted as the greatest performance in the event's history, if not Prince's career. Here are some of the other most memorable - and surprising - moments from the last 30 years. Super Bowl performers get a very strict 12-minute time limit, so most performers cram their set with as much music as possible. Not Michael Jackson. After shooting onto the stage at the Pasadena Rose Bowl, he stood completely still, staring at the world for a full 90 seconds. Ninety. It was a master class in ratcheting expectation to a fever pitch. And the screams when he launched into Jam (not one of his best songs) proved he knew what he was doing. Brilliantly, Jackson staged this entire performance while wearing a jacket it looked like he'd borrowed from Muammar Gaddafi. Beat that, Gaga. Baby, he was born to run... and slide on his knees... and crotch slam a TV camera. In his autobiography, The Boss explains the incident like this: ""Too much adrenalin, a late drop, too much speed, here I come, Mikeâ€¦ BOOM! ""And I'm onto his camera, the lens implanted into my chest with one leg off the stage. I use his camera to push myself back up andâ€¦ BLAM! BORN TO RUN!"" It led to the memorable headline: ""America Attacked by Bruce Springsteen's crotch"" - but it didn't stop the star delivering one of the most powerful and energetic Super Bowl shows in recent history. Even if they were fined for over-running by 40 seconds. Coldplay were the headline act at last year's Super Bowl in Santa Clara - but someone forgot to tell Beyonce. She only performed one song, Formation, underscoring its message of black pride and power with back-up dancers dressed in leather body suits and black berets reminiscent of the Black Panthers movement. Some of her dancers were even pictured holding up a sign declaring ""Justice 4 Mario Woods"" - a 26-year-old black man who was shot dead by armed police in San Francisco two months earlier. The performance heralded the arrival of her unapologetically political album, Lemonade, later in the year.

However, since it was published 50 years ago, the author has been largely private and the town in which she grew up has changed greatly.","Harper Lee's classic was published 50 years ago this summer and it remains the only novel she ever wrote. Lee, 84, has never explained why she stopped writing. She doesn't give interviews - ""Hell, no"" was her response to a request several decades ago - and that silence has only added to the intrigue. But her close friend Thomas Lane Butts, a retired minister in her hometown, Monroeville, Alabama, says she once told him the reason. Sitting on a pew in the Methodist church which the Lee family still attends, he described to me how she suddenly brought the subject up one night over dinner in New York. ""She asked me, 'You ever wonder why I didn't write anything else?' And I said, 'Along with several million other people, yes, I had wondered about that.' And she said, 'Well, what do you think?'"" Speaking in his slow southern drawl, the Rev Butts, who just turned 80, suggested to her that she had already written a great book and therefore didn't need to compete with herself. ""And when I got through she said, 'You're all wrong.' I said, 'Alright, smart Alec. You tell me.' She said, 'I would not go through all the deprivation of privacy through which I went for this book again for any amount of money.' ""And she said, 'I did not need to write another book. I said what I wanted to say in that book.'"" Harper Lee called it a simple tale about the ""conflict of the human soul"" and Monroeville, Alabama, is where she drew her inspiration. The story depicts the segregated South of her childhood, during the Depression. It was published at the height of the civil rights struggle. The Rev Butts grew up 10 miles outside Monroeville. By the late 1950s, he says, he was a ""fuzzy-cheeked young preacher"" campaigning for an end to segregation. He had met Martin Luther King Jr and signed a petition to boycott buses. The Ku Klux Klan had left a burning cross on his front lawn. He says To Kill a Mockingbird was not well received in Monroeville when it was published. ""The people who were hard racist did not like it because of the implication of the book,"" the Rev Butts told me. ""The book revealed racism and that always frightens a racist - when you pull the cover off them. ""Those of us who stood up for civil rights were much encouraged by the book because in a very skilful and subtle way it addressed itself for justice."" But these days, the Rev Butts says, there is enormous civic pride in Monroeville. The old courthouse, which Hollywood re-created for the film, now houses a museum to Harper Lee and the town's other literary icon, Truman Capote. Capote was a childhood friend of hers and is thought to be the inspiration for the Dill character in To Kill a Mockingbird. The town's residents often try to protect Lee, allowing her to live a normal life instead of being hounded by fans or bothered with prying questions. ""Being famous",1,5,4

That is down from 6.1% in the previous quarter. Analysts were expecting the same figure for January to March. India is the third-largest economy in Asia but has been struggling with inflation and currency weakness. Since July last year, the Indian rupee has seen one of the biggest declines among Asian currencies, dropping more than 27% against the US dollar. ""Shocking numbers as growth was even lower than lows witnessed during the financial crisis,"" said Anubhuti Sahay from Standard Chartered Bank in Mumbai. The BBC's Yogita Limaye in Mumbai said that just a year ago India was aspiring for double-digit growth. But a global slowdown has reduced external demand, and high inflation coupled with a weak rupee has made things more expensive within the country. Domestic demand, which India's economy is largely reliant on, has also slowed in part due to the political upheaval in the country. India's economy is suffering from ""policy incoherence, shifting global risk appetite and a comatose government"", said Rajeev Malik, senior economist at brokerage CLSA India's Prime Minister Manmohan Singh admitted early this month that his government must do more to get the once fast-growing economy moving again. The Congress-led coalition government is caught up in a slew of corruption scandals. Key policy reforms, including allowing foreign investment in India's retail sector, have been delayed in parliament for more than a year. This has worried foreign investors and threatened the country's investment grade credit rating.

Wrockwardine Wood and Sutherland academies, also run by the Telford Co-operative Multi-Academy Trust, were put in special measures earlier this week. The trust has not commented. Ofsted criticised the trust's lack of support to the schools and said each was now considering an alternative sponsor. Inspectors said pupils' achievement at the Phoenix Academy had dropped since it became an academy in 2013 and their latest report rated it inadequate in all areas. A report in 2013, before it converted, rated the secondary school as ""requiring improvement"", while Lakeside was rated ""good"" in 2012 under its former name the Lord Silkin School. In the latest report, inspectors said the curriculum at Phoenix Academy was ""inadequate"", while ""weak teaching"" meant pupils were not sufficiently challenged and were often ""disengaged and disruptive"". There was particular criticism of standards in English and maths which the watchdog said were limiting pupils' achievements in other areas. Ofsted's report said governors, managers and teachers had developed a ""culture of low expectations"", while leaders had failed to act decisively to halt the decline in pupils' achievement. There was, however, some praise for the acting head teacher. Inspectors said he had introduced a number of improvement measures and some were ""beginning to have an impact"". A report on Lakeside School highlighted similar concerns, criticising teachers for not sufficiently challenging pupils and for having ""over generous"" predictions of their achievement. Inspectors said many pupils, whether high achievers or those with special educational needs, were ""not making the progress they should"" and achievements at GCSE were well below the national average.

The hosts, slacker after the break, had beleaguered striker Larnell Cole sent-off after he confronted the referee. Liam Craig sealed the win from the penalty spot with two minutes to play, before Graham Cummins finished a sumptuous stoppage-time move. And things got worse still for Caley Thistle after the match, with captain Gary Warren shown a red card in the tunnel. Saints remain five points clear of Hearts in fourth place, and closed the gap on third-placed Rangers, who play Aberdeen on Sunday, to three points. With game after game ticking past, Inverness' position looks increasingly perilous. Next weekend's trip to Motherwell, second-bottom on goal difference, is now seismic. This contest turned nightmarish for the hosts after a bright opening, but the truth is, given their predicament, Caley Thistle did not threaten St Johnstone's goal enough. Billy Mckay sent a shot over from close range. Alex Fisher nodded a diving header wide. Carl Tremarco miscued a volley. Greg Tansey did draw a save from Alan Mannus when he rasped in an effort from outside the box, but Richie Foran's side never looked likely to find the net. Their best opportunity came immediately after the Saints went ahead, when Tansey fed Cole, who seemed to panic in a terrific position and shot straight at Mannus. Cole's dismissal ended the contest when he appeared to be cautioned twice for challenging referee Stephen Finnie's decision not to award a foul. St Johnstone were merciless and could have had more. With just one win from their last 21 league games, Inverness look deep in trouble. Tommy Wright's side deserve so much credit. Saints were tactically brilliant, so strong defensively and ruthlessly capitalised on their man advantage. They took one of their few first-half chances when Michael Coulson broke down the left and sent a dangerous ball across the six-yard box. Owain Fon Williams could only parry into the danger area, Cummins' shot was blocked but Maclean followed up to force it home. They should have had another when Craig's superb curling corner flew all the way to the back post where Cummins slid in and somehow knocked it over from two yards. Craig, in his 300th appearance for the club, coolly converted a spot-kick after Cummins was tripped to seal the points. Cummins then slammed home after Miller danced around the area to tee him up, before Craig cracked the bar amid the late flurry. With a tendency to finish the season strongly, and just a three-point gap to Rangers, the Perth side look capable of something special this term. Inverness CT manager Richie Foran: ""It is a tough time of the season to be sitting bottom, and I need real men to stand up to that, but not enough of them did that today. ""It is pure luck we are still in it and it is only four points. I sound like a broken record but one win changes it - that is the truth.

A reading below 50 indicates falling output. It is the first time that activity in the sector has fallen since March 2013. Firms blamed soft domestic demand, a fall in new business from overseas and uncertainty ahead of the EU referendum. A slowdown in the oil and gas industry, a major customer for UK companies, is also hitting production. The index for new orders fell to 50.4 in April, from 51.9 the month before, matching February's three-year low. Rob Dobson, senior economist at Markit, said: ""On this evidence manufacturing production is now falling at a quarterly pace of around 1%, and will likely act as a drag on the economy again during the second quarter and putting greater pressure on the service sector to sustain GDP growth.

David Noble, group chief executive at the Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply (CIPS), said: ""Recent fears over a stall in the UK's manufacturing sector have now become a reality. ""An atmosphere of deep unease is building throughout the manufacturing supply chain, eating away at new orders, reducing British exports and putting more jobs at risk. ""A sense of apprehension across the sector is being caused by enduring volatility in the oil and gas industry, falling retailer confidence and the uncertainty created by the EU referendum."" The Markit/CIPS survey found new export orders contracted for the fourth straight month in April as the global economy continued to slow. A measure of employment in the manufacturing sector was also below the 50 mark for its fourth straight month.

openai_text-curie-001,Morocco has been accepted back into the African Union after years of campaigning.,"It was a ""good opportunity"" and ""a chance to work together,"" a top Western Sahara official told the BBC. Morocco controls two-thirds of Western Sahara and sees it as part of its historic territory. However some, including the UN, see Western Sahara as Africa's last colony. Africa Live: More on this and other stories Find out more about Western Sahara A referendum was promised in 1991 but never carried out due to wrangling over who was eligible to vote. Thousands of Sahrawi refugees still live in refugee camps in Algeria - some have been there for 40 years. It is not clear what happens next but Western Sahara is hopeful that a committee set up by the AU will address the issues that both sides have raised. Some AU delegates said that it would be easier to resolve the issue with Morocco inside the AU. Sidi Mohammed, a Western Sahara official, told the BBC that Morocco's return to the AU means that it would now be expected to put ""in practice decisions taken by the AU with regard to a referendum in Western Sahara"". Mr Mohammed dismissed the suggestion that Morocco would now seek to get the AU to change its position, saying that the no country could unilaterally change the AU fundamental agreement, saying it opposed colonisation. In his speech at the AU summit, King Mohammed VI of Morocco said the readmission was not meant to divide the continental body. No. Algeria has always been a big supporter of Western Sahara's Polisario Front and it had wanted Morocco to accept independence of the territory as a condition for readmission. Zimbabwe and South Africa were also supportive of this stance but they were outnumbered by those who wanted Morocco back in the fold. There is no specific provision in the AU charter that bars any country from joining it. Morocco simply applied and the request was accepted by more than two-thirds of the 53 members. Morocco has been involved in intense lobbying and applied in July last year to rejoin the continental body. King Mohammed toured various African countries seeking support for the bid. No. While culturally the country's identity aligns with Arab states, its economic interests increasingly lie in Africa. This is a strategic move to continue exploring its interests in mining, construction, medical, insurance and banking sectors on the continent.

The council's head of neighbourhood and strategic housing, Kristine Reeves, was later sacked over the affair. The development proposals, put forward by Norwich City Council, include 60 flats and 45 houses. The report to the council says 35 of the houses and flats will be for social rent. A report to Norwich City Council's planning committee, which meets on Thursday, advises councillors to approve the plans. Elderly residents were moved out of Greyhound Opening and nearby Goldsmith Street seven years ago after Norwich City Council agreed to redevelop the site. The council agreed that new employees relocating to the city could move in temporarily ahead of demolition. However other staff, including Ms Reeves, also moved in, in contravention of council policy. The council resisted calls for a full independent inquiry. Its own investigation found safeguards covering conflicts of interest were in place but not followed. In February 2009, London-based architects Riches Hawley Mikhail won a competition to design a new social housing development on the site, but they were never commissioned. During that year homes on the derelict site were demolished, but the site has since remained untouched.",1,5,5

The ruling NEC body discussed the issue at a meeting on Friday, where they also decided to allow a controversial anti-Islam campaigner to run for the UKIP leadership. Mr Oakden said: ""A member of the NEC had contacted the person that is putting this forward and said to them they need to follow the proper process of completing the necessary forms and submitting them to the NEC.

""Her lack of effort in pursuing the aims of the party both locally and nationally is of concern to members across the region."" Mr Owen added he believed members would stop supporting UKIP if Ms Brown remained in the role. However, a spokesman for the party's assembly group dismissed the letter as written by a ""tiny and insignificant group"". In February, Ms Brown denied an allegation she had smoked recreational drugs in a hotel room.

Downing Street did not comment on President Obama's remark to the PM about defence spending, reportedly made before Chancellor George Osborne said the government would fulfil a Nato pledge to spend 2% of national income on defence last year. In response to the interview, a spokesman for the US National Security Council said Mr Cameron had been ""as close a partner as the president has had"" adding that ""we deeply value the UK's contributions on our shared national security and foreign policy objectives"".

openai_text-curie-001,Ricky Burns won the WBA World Super-Lightweight title by knockout in a confident display at Glasgow's Hydro.,"With three defeats in his previous six bouts, the Scottish boxer's career seemed to be on the wane. But his power, timing and focus returned in a supremely confident display at Glasgow's Hydro on Saturday night as he clinched the vacant WBA World Super-Lightweight title - and entered the record books as the first Scot to win world titles at three weights. Italy's Michele Di Rocco, at 34 a year older than Burns, hadn't lost a fight since September 2007. He arrived with a record of 40 wins and a draw from 42 bouts. He left a lesser figure. The referee deemed the man from Assisi to be in no state to continue in the eighth round, the result of a welter of blows to his head and body and made all the more unbearable by the hostile acoustic energy generated by 8,000 Scottish fans. Surely, for Burns, this was time to shout about his record, the ideal moment to counter all those who had written him off and questioned the wisdom of him leaving trainer Billy Nelson two years ago to work with Tony Sim in Essex? No. Instead, the champion spoke of his disbelief at the ease of his victory, his gratitude that he was safe, of his thanks to promoter Eddie Hearn, manager Alex Morrison and coach Sim for believing in him, and of his desire to celebrate with a fast-food burger and 20 chicken nuggets. ""When I got in the ring after the fight, I said, 'You've done it! You've done it!',"" reported a beaming Hearn at the post-fight media conference. ""And you know what Ricky said? 'Can you get a picture with me and Michael Buffer [the legendary American boxing ring announcer]?'"" When he has time to reflect during a well-earned holiday, Burns will take immense satisfaction at being only the third British-born fighter, after Bob Fitzsimmons and Duke McKenzie, to be a three-weight world champion. In Scottish terms, his achievements must mean that he is in the very top tier of boxing greats, comfortably mentioned in the same breath as former world champions Benny Lynch, Walter McGowan, Jackie Paterson, Ken Buchanan and Jim Watt, for example. Burns' record stands at 40 wins from 46 bouts. Remarkably, 11 of those have been world title fights. Buchanan's exploits in the United States add lustre to his legacy, but while Burns may never have fought someone like Roberto Duran, should Hearn manage to set up a bout against Cincinnati's Adrien Broner, the four-time world champion stripped of the WBA title because he could not make the weight, then Burns could achieve little more in the sport. ""There are some big fights out there for me,"" said Burns. ""I want to fight the top names. I will fight anybody. I do super-lightweight comfortably and lightweight is still an option. I would fight Terence Crawford again if it came down to it. ""That's nearly two years I have been with Tony and things have just started clicking.

The draw sees third-placed Hampshire claim 12 points, while Surrey take 10 points and stay sixth in Division One. Burns' epic effort saw him stay in the field for all but 10 overs of the entire match, as he defied Hampshire's bowling efforts on a flat Oval pitch. The left-hander was dropped twice in the slip cordon in his career-best 219, but was the only one to resist as Ian Holland (3-37) dismissed Tom Curran (53), Amar Virdi and Mark Footitt to force the follow-on after Surrey began the day on 410-7. Mark Stoneman (47) and Burns then put on an opening stand of 109 before Holland's medium pace had Stoneman lbw and Scott Borthwick bowled in a single over.

Sexually explicit content is not outlawed in Russia, but the law bans ""the illegal production, dissemination and advertisement of pornographic materials and objects"". It is not uncommon for Russia to ban websites. The government agency Roskomnadzor maintains a blacklist that now includes thousands of them.

The law was approved by Russia's upper house of parliament in April. It includes measures to ensure that bloggers cannot remain anonymous, and states that social networks must maintain six months of data on its users. The information must be stored on servers based in Russian territory, so that government authorities can gain access.

Some already share advice on how to use proxy servers in order to access social media sites that, in their view, are under threat of being closed. It is hard to see how the law will be enforced. The servers for most of the popular social media platforms that many Russians use are based outside Russia. Many popular bloggers are already looking for, and apparently finding, ways to ""cheat"" the feature that counts page visits and keep their daily unique visitor numbers just under 3000, or to make sure that the statistics are hidden altogether. Anton Nossik, who is considered Russia's ""internet guru"", wrote in his LiveJournal blog that the new law didn't threaten individual bloggers directly, but provided legal grounds to block popular social networks like Facebook, Twitter, LiveJournal and Google. ""The issue of banning all these platforms in Russia is a political one and it will be decided by only one person"", Mr Nossik wrote, with a thinly veiled reference to President Vladimir Putin. Earlier in the year, Russia enacted a law that gave the government powers to block websites without explanation. In March, Moscow blocked the blog of Mr Navalny, along with two news sites and a organisation run by Garry Kasparov - a vocal critic of the Russian government. In a statement, Russia's prosecutor general's office said the blocks were imposed because of the sites' role in helping stage illegal protests. Earlier this week, Twitter blocked access to an anti-Kremlin account that often publishes leaked government documents, following a request by Russia's federal communications agency Roskomnadzor.

It also says they should not ratify a similar deal that has already been done between the EU and Canada. It says some aspects pose a threat to democracy and the rule of law. One of the concerns mentioned in the petition is the idea of tribunals that foreign investors would be able to use in some circumstances to sue governments. There is a great deal of controversy over exactly what this system, known as Investor State Dispute Settlement, would enable companies to do, but campaigners see it as an opportunity for international business to get compensation for government policy changes that adversely affect them. This kind of provision exists in many bilateral trade and investment agreements. Friends of the Earth have published new research on the impact they have had on EU countries. Information about these cases is not always made public, but the group says that going back to 1994, foreign investors have sought compensation of almost €30bn (£24bn) from 20 states. Where the results are known (a small minority of the total), the tribunals have awarded total compensation of €3.5bn (about £2.8bn). In Britain, the possible implications of this provision for the National Health Service have been especially controversial. Campaigners believe that the investor tribunals would make it harder to reverse any decisions to contract services out to international healthcare firms. John Hilary of War on Want said: TTIP ""will make it impossible for any future government to repeal the Health & Social Care Act and bring the NHS back into public hands"". The petition lists a number of other areas where its signatories believes European standards would suffer if the TTIP negotiations are completed and the Canada deal is ratified: employment, social, environmental, privacy and consumer protection. The European Commission says the EU will not have to sacrifice its high standards. It also says investor protection provisions are important for investment flows and have in general worked well. But it accepts there is a need for improvement and is trying to achieve that in its bilateral negotiations. The petition has been organised as an exercise called a European Citizens' Initiative which can lead to a public hearing in the European Parliament and require the European Commission to give a formal response explaining why it is accepting or rejecting what the petitioners call for.

""And, to have to say that we're having to cut some money back is, I believe, not the right way to go."" Former badminton player Susan Egelstaff, a double bronze medallist at the Commonwealth Games [in 2002 and 2006] and an Olympian, fears the cuts will have ""a huge impact"". ""What that means in the future is that Scotland will be constantly playing catch-up,"" she said. ""It's almost impossible to catch up if you fall too far behind the leading nations."" The Scottish Government said sport and physical activity play a ""key role"" in a healthy Scotland and that ""significant"" investment would continue in those areas. ""Having successfully delivered the Commonwealth Games [in 2014] we are now focusing on protecting or raising investment in areas intended to decrease health inequality and improve life chances, and the small reduction in the sport budget allows us to support those priorities,"" Minister for Sport Aileen Campbell said. ""There is on-going support for active lifestyles through capital investment in cycling and walking, and over the last 10 years we have invested £168m in sport infrastructure - from grassroots to the elite performance which has increased the facilities and opportunities to get people active and achieve on the world stage at both the Olympics and Commonwealth Games.""",1,4,5

At the party's weekly press briefing, I asked the Welsh Conservative leader Andrew RT Davies, who was elected on the list, whether he'd stand as a constituency candidate in his home turf of the Vale of Glamorgan but he said he hadn't thought about it. Presumably those are the kind of decisions they will now feel more confident contemplating. The party will also have a huge amount of new data on voters which it'll be able to call upon and the belief that campaigning hard on the NHS helped the Tories cross the line in places like the Vale of Clwyd and Gower. The Conservatives feel it's them, rather than any of the other opposition parties, who have become the repository of votes from those who are disaffected by the state of the NHS. Welsh Labour are going to hold a ""short sharp"" analysis into what went wrong. Carwyn Jones was in line with most of the criticism of Ed Miliband when he told AMs that the party needed to appeal to small business owners who are not millionaires but who work hard. What will be more difficult is countering the argument on the NHS, which the former minister Alun Davies believes is already lost. Another potential difficulty for Welsh Labour will be dealing with unhappiness within the party over council re-organisation. Bernie Attridge, the deputy leader of Flintshire Council, has tweeted saying the party needs to be careful on local government reform if it wants to retain the support of grassroots councillors. It also seems to have been the case that Labour lost more votes to UKIP than the Conservatives, which is another challenge to overcome. But Labour will at least have the advantage that it will be David Cameron, and not Ed Miliband, carrying out the latest round of public sector cuts that are likely to take effect sooner rather than later. The question is whether Carwyn Jones is going to be able to turn that to his advantage when his own record in government will be under scrutiny. Plaid Cymru's education spokesman, Simon Thomas, also in the party's weekly press briefing, said he believed Leanne Wood could portray herself as an alternative first minister because of the way she emotionally connected with people in the campaign. The party now has a year to make that a credible proposition after it failed to gain any new seats and came fourth, behind UKIP, in the overall share of the vote, despite her unprecedented profile. He also said that on the campaign trail people wanted to know what Plaid was going to do about the NHS and that people ""did not see the strengths"" of its arguments. The Welsh Liberal Democrats are still licking their wounds but in a ""je ne regrette rien"" moment, the leader Kirsty Williams said she had no regrets over the coalition.

I was here on 25 January when riot police forced us out and by the 28th, we were back following the violence. I've been sleeping here most of the time since. Our social network was established in 2005, when there was a democratic opening around the time of the presidential elections. People from different backgrounds all met through blogging and hoped to use technology for social change. It meant we have all gained good contacts, experience and strong networks. I like to think the social network is the people itself. Things like Facebook, Twitter, SMS and phones are just social tools. When they blocked Facebook and shut down technology, our network still operated because it's about people. Internet activists are also people and a lot of our organising, social work and relationships are developed offline. This is something that people dreamt of but didn't anticipate happening in reality. If anything, it shows that all the effort we put in over the past few years has not been wasted. It has climaxed into this critical mass of people you see in the square. At the moment I'm not getting a lot of internet connection. I'm trying not to drain my phone battery. We're still using it to distribute footage people are bringing to us that we've sorted through. I hope the internet will continue to play a complementary role in activism. At the moment we physically exist in downtown Cairo and I hope that when we have finished this sit-in, we will have won the right to organise ourselves outside the internet. Twitter: Amr Gharbeia I was involved in this revolution from the first day, 25 January, and I've now been spending my nights here for a while. For the past five years, I was very active online, blogging and tweeting. As we live under emergency laws in Egypt it has been very difficult to meet or communicate except on the internet. I'd never been part of a demonstration on the ground. At first we were mocking the event on 25 January. We questioned whether it was really possible to have a ""Facebook revolution"". I came on the 25th because I felt it was my duty as a citizen and I couldn't believe how it turned into something so different from what we've seen before. I was walking among the people and weeping. Now I sometimes just tweet to update people about what's going on or to call for a million-man demonstration or a day to remember our martyrs. I'm well-known among bloggers for my long articles and constant tweets, but once I was here I stopped communicating this way so much. I felt it was totally different to have real freedom rather than just hypothetical freedom or internet freedom. Blogging and tweeting has been important as we were building our minds.

Election officials have urged patience. Uhuru Kenyatta, who faces trial at the International Criminal Court, has been leading in early presidential results declared from Monday's tightly contested election. He is due to stand trial at The Hague next month for allegedly fuelling violence after the disputed 2007 election. He denies the charge. His closest rival is outgoing Prime Minister Raila Odinga. With provisional results in from more than 40% of polling stations earlier on Wednesday, Mr Odinga had 42% of the vote compared with Mr Kenyatta's 53%. However, Mr Odinga's allies remain confident that he will gain ground as results from his strongholds, including the Coast Province, are declared. More than 1,000 people were killed in the violence which broke out in 2007-08 after Mr Odinga claimed he had been cheated of victory by supporters of President Mwai Kibaki, who is stepping down after two terms in office. The BBC's Solomon Mugera in the capital, Nairobi, says Kenyans are becoming increasingly anxious about the delay in finalising the results. Some businesses and schools across the country have remained shut since Monday's election, he says.

The couple spoke out in response to consultation on proposed reform of sentencing for driving offences. They believe increased sentences should be backed up by manslaughter charges. Mr Moores, 28, was killed by a Vauxhall Astra driven by Donna Hackett on the M4 near Swindon. Hackett, then aged 26, fled and was found by police asleep in a ditch. She served half of a six-year jail term after she was found guilty of causing death by careless driving while drunk.

The group has warned that 750 more foster carers are ""urgently"" needed to meet the demands of the care system. It urged people to ""open their hearts and homes"" to vulnerable youngsters. Currently, more than 5,500 children are in foster care in Scotland, living with 4,400 families and carers. The Fostering Network surveyed 250 children, teenagers and foster carers across Scotland and discovered that many young people had failed to find stability. Almost half were already living with their third family, a quarter were with their fourth family and about 20 were living with their 10th family since going into care. There was a particular need for homes to be found for vulnerable teenagers, siblings and disabled children, the study found. Carla, 23, was taken into care at the age of 12 and had eight foster homes before moving in with the Randalls. ""Looking back now I realised that the Randalls saved my life,"" she said. ""I never understood the extent of the neglect and abuse I had endured until I came to live with a 'normal' loving family. ""They were just always themselves, the smallest details meant so much to me. ""They nurtured a young, angry, untrusting teenager to become a positive, empathetic and successful young woman."" The Fostering Network said instability had a detrimental effect on the child's education and wellbeing, while finding a stable foster carer from the outset could lead to improved relationships and a happier childhood. Sara Lurie, director of the Fostering Network Scotland, said: ""As each year passes, we see more and more children coming into care. ""We need people who can open their heart, and their homes, to vulnerable children and young people and use their skills to help support them to reach their full potential.

The ruling preserves the law known as Obamacare, which Mr Obama considers a major part of his presidential legacy. Republicans have vowed to continue fighting the law. ""We've got more work to do, but what we're not going to do is unravel what has now been woven into the fabric of America,"" Mr Obama said. The case, known as King v Burwell, was the second major challenge the law has faced in the US's highest court. Unlike in many other western countries, the US does not have a single-payer healthcare system. Private companies, rather than the US government, provide health insurance for US citizens. The enactment of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) - one of Mr Obama's most significant and controversial domestic achievements - in 2010 mandated that every American had to purchase private insurance. It provided the subsidies to allow many to do so. In 2012, the mandate portion of the law was challenged in the court. The justices ruled to preserve it. In that decision, as in the decision on Thursday, Chief Justice John Roberts surprised observers by siding with his liberal colleagues in support of the law. ""Congress passed the Affordable Care act to improve health insurance markets, not to destroy them,"" Chief Justice John Roberts wrote in the opinion. Justice Anthony Kennedy dissented in 2012, but sided with the majority on Thursday. Had the court made the opposite decision, an estimated 8.7 million people in the US would have been at risk of losing the aid that makes healthcare affordable. The stakes could not have been higher. People's health (crucially important) and Obama's legacy (less important, but for him and those around him fairly vital) were at stake. Well a politically finely balanced Supreme Court has given an emphatic, overwhelming vote in favour of the president by 6-3. I bet ""No-drama Obama"" is high-fiving anyone and everyone in the White House - that is how big it is. Obama defies lame-duck expectations Demonstrators gathered outside the court as early on Thursday morning. Reading updates on their mobile phones, the crowd became jubilant when they learned mid-morning that the court had ruled in their favour. Some began dancing, while others chanted ""If you're covered and you know it clap your hands."" ""This is a big sigh of relief for millions across the country,"" said Ron Pollack of Families USA, a health-care advocacy organisation. ""The ACA is not just the law of the land, it will remain the law of the land"". ""Today is a good day for healthcare in America,"" said activist Benton Strong. ""I hope this is the end of the line."" Demonstrators opposing the subsidies did not have a large visible presence. Justice Antonin Scalia wrote in his dissent that the Supreme Court is setting a precedent of favouring some laws over others.

openai_text-curie-001,The lack of a coroner to oversee the inquest into the 1976 murders of nine people at Kingsmill is delaying the case.,"Republicans ambushed a mini-bus carrying the men at Kingsmill in County Armagh in 1976 and murdered them after checking what religion they were. Senior coroner John Leckey is retiring this year and told a preliminary hearing of the inquest in Belfast that no replacement has been appointed. His retirement could leave only one coroner in Northern Ireland. Kingsmill is among dozens of inquests dating from the early days of the Troubles that face delay because not enough money is available to investigate or there is nobody to oversee fresh hearings. Mr Leckey said: ""I feel for the bereaved families, not exclusively Kingsmill but for other inquests I am involved in. ""It is a disappointment that is widespread."" A lawyer for some of the Kingsmill victims' families said they would be pressing Stormont's justice department for more resources to allow an inquest to go ahead. Karen Armstrong, a sister of one of the murdered men, said the lack of resources was ""a political problem"". ""We are not going to lie down and accept it,"" she said. ""We will fight until we get another date and they have to make sure there are enough coroners in Northern Ireland to deal with our and many other cases."" Ulster Unionist MLA Danny Kennedy said he would be asking Justice Minister David Ford to ensure the matter was referred to the relevant authorities so that ""action can be taken as soon as possible"". ""Justice has been denied for almost 40 years and it is totally unacceptable that this inquest should be delayed further due to the unavailability of a coroner,"" he said. ""This was one of the most shocking and cruel events of the Troubles and the inquest must be treated with the seriousness this crime merits."" A Department of Justice spokesman said: ""Officials are actively working to ensure that all necessary resources are provided for the conduct of inquests in Northern Ireland. ""There are currently three full-time coroners in Northern Ireland. In addition, one High Court judge and one County Court judge have also been appointed as coroners.""",1,4,3

Researchers have used government records to understand when and how the numbers of gibbons declined, and believe that better understanding of the animals' decline would help to establish a conservation plan for","Today, China has between 26 and 28 Hainan gibbons left, but government records that date back to the 17th Century show that gibbons were once widespread across half of the country. The apes began to disappear from the documents about 150 years ago, corresponding with population growth. The study is published in the Proceedings of the Royal Society B. Hainan gibbons are now limited to a few isolated patches of forest in the south west of China. They live in just four social groups, one of which was only discovered a few weeks ago. Understanding this population crash has been difficult, but the old government documents have helped to reveal when and how the numbers fell. Dr Sam Turvey, from the Zoological Society of London, said: ""China is one of the few places in the world that has a very very rich, long historical record. ""Because it has had such a complex bureaucracy for so long, there has been a lot of need for reporting - not just numbers of households for tax purposes and things like that, but also in terms of the kinds of natural resources that were available in the immediate environment."" These included records of animals, including gibbons, he said. ""We looked at the pattern of disappearance of gibbons through time and how that varied from place to place and the different environmental conditions and human pressures that were also present in these places."" The archives show that gibbons were a common sight in about 20 provinces in China well into the 17th and 18th Century. However, Dr Turvey said it was ""a stark contrast to their very imperilled position today"". ""We see a really steep increase in population decline and real population collapse across China about 100-150 years ago,"" he added. ""And this correlates with demographic expansion in China towards the end of the Imperial era and through the 20th Century, and the massive increase in deforestation and human population growth through the time of the Chinese Republic and the establishment of the communist party."" The researchers said a better understanding of the animals' decline would help them to establish a conservation plan for the country's last few Hainan gibbons. Dr Turvey said: ""It is an incredible privilege to be able to see gibbons in China in the wild. ""The Hainan gibbon is such as rare species, but knowing that this species is still hanging on there gives you hope that conservation will be able to bring that population back from the brink.""

Some of the items found included an armour-piercing improvised rocket and two anti-personnel mines. The main line of police inquiry is the arms belonged to dissident republicans. Last week, Home Secretary Theresa May said MI5 believed an attack on targets in Great Britain by dissident republicans had become ""a strong possibility"". Analysis: Vincent Kearney, BBC News NI's home affairs correspondent The discovery of what appears to be a second dissident republican arms dump near Larne within three months has left police baffled. Based on location alone, the analysis would be that the items found most likely belonged to loyalist paramilitaries. But the nature of what was found suggests otherwise and the finger of suspicion firmly in the direction of dissident republicans. Det Supt Kevin Geddes said the threat level in Northern Ireland from dissident republican groups remains ""severe"" and an attack is ""highly likely"". Police officers found three barrels hidden in holes in the forest. As well as rockets and mines, there were also several pipe bombs, assault rifle ammunition and parts to construct a ""substantial number of explosive devices"". Det Supt Geddes said the seizure was significant ""both in terms of its size and its capability"". ""A number of these devices were ready to be deployed,"" he added. ""This seizure has undoubtedly saved lives."" He said the type of weapons that had been found meant police would focus their investigation on dissident republicans. In March, an arms find was made at Carnfunnock Country Park near Larne, and police said the were investigating a connection between the two discoveries.

Archaeologists are concerned a planned 2.9km tunnel being considered for the nearby A303 main road will damage the site. Discoveries have also shown stones were warmed up by the Mesolithic Period inhabitants and used in a hearth to emit heat in the earthy snug.

Buksh will be sentenced on 27 June. The High Court in Glasgow heard that 43-year-old Mrs Buksh died after being struck on the head at least five times. Pathologists told the court that the lack of defensive injuries and the position of her body suggested she was assaulted as she slept. Following the attack, Buksh went to Cathcart Police Station and told an officer: ""I've come to hand myself in. I think my wife's dead. I hit her on the head. I did it.""

The city was rocked by riots in April when a black man died after suffering injuries in police custody. Six officers were charged over the death of the 25-year-old, Freddie Gray. Speaking at a news conference on Wednesday, Mayor Rawlings-Blake said Mr Batts had ""served this city with distinction"" since becoming police chief in October 2012. But referring to the city's high homicide rate, she said ""too many continue to die"". ""The focus has been too much on the leadership of the department and not enough on the crime fighting,"" she told reporters, adding: ""We need to get the crime surge under control."" The city has seen a sharp increase in violence since Freddie Gray's death on 19 April, with 155 homicides this year, a 48% increase over the same period last year. On Tuesday, the police department announced that an outside organisation will review its response to the civil unrest that followed Mr Gray's death. The US justice department is also conducting a civil rights review of the Baltimore force and Mr Batts has been criticised by the city's police union. Earlier on Wednesday, the union released its report into the police handling of the rioting. It said officers had complained ""that they lacked basic riot equipment, training, and, as events unfolded, direction from leadership"". The report also said ""officers repeatedly expressed concern that the passive response to the civil unrest had allowed the disorder to grow into full scale rioting"". Recent events had ""placed attention on police leadership"", Ms Rawlings-Blake said, but denied her decision was influenced by the union report. Mr Davis, who is taking over immediately as interim police chief, praised his ""friend"" Mr Batts and said he was a ""true reform commissioner"".

His intervention in the debate - made, as he termed it, with ""deafening eclat"" - was even said to have helped cause the pound to slide on the international money markets as traders thought it made the possibility of a so-called Brexit more likely. He has arguably the highest profile of any of the governing Conservative Party except the Prime Minister David Cameron, but those outside the UK may be wondering: who is he, and is that actually his hair? Read on. Profile: Boris Johnson How could 'zip wire prat' become prime minister? Read more about the UK's referendum on the EU Alexander Boris de Pfeffel Johnson, to give him his full name, was born in New York and is descended from Turkish, French and German stock. He describes himself as a ""one-man melting pot"". He first made a name for himself in journalism, including a stint as Brussels correspondent for the right-wing Daily Telegraph newspaper and editor of The Spectator magazine. His humorous persona led him to become a fixture on various television programmes, including the satirical BBC panel show Have I Got News For You. He still has a lucrative and entertaining column in the Daily Telegraph, in which august forum he explained the reasons for his decision on the EU. As a politician, he has been a Conservative member of parliament for two constituencies, Henley from 2001 to 2008 and then Uxbridge and South Ruislip from 2015. Lest you think he was putting his feet up between parliamentary mandates, he is also currently serving the second of two terms as mayor of London, no mean feat in a city where the centre-left Labour Party has dominated in recent decades. That's indicative of the position Mr Johnson has carved out for himself as one of the most charismatic politicians in the UK who has wide appeal beyond Conservative heartlands - polling has suggested that his stance on the EU referendum may sway some undecided voters. Just look what happens when you type his name into Google.co.uk. Not quite. He has previously courted controversy for his remarks about (among others) the populations of Liverpool, Portsmouth and Papua New Guinea, not to mention run-ins with his own party leadership and TV chef Jamie Oliver. Last October he accidentally flattened a 10-year-old schoolboy at what was meant to be a friendly game of photo-op rugby in Japan. But none of this seems to have affected his standing among the party faithful or the public at large. Even getting stuck on a zip-wire during the London Olympics in 2012, a sure-fire route to derision for any other politician, only enhanced his eccentric image.

""In future I will be better - definitely,"" said the former Barcelona and Bayern Munich coach. ""This season has been a massive lesson for me."" He added: ""We have a lot of beautiful things to fight for and to qualify for the Champions League will be a huge success. But we have to be honest with ourselves. We were not good enough to compete for the Premier League [title]."" Defeat at Stamford Bridge left City just four points ahead of Arsenal and Manchester United, both of whom have a game in hand. With the FA Cup being City's only realistic chance of winning a trophy this term, it is likely to be the worst season of Guardiola's managerial career. The 46-year-old has never gone a single season without winning a trophy - he has won the title in six out of seven attempts and his sides have always reached the last four of the Champions League. Guardiola has also responded to questions about a row between City and Chelsea coaching staff at Stamford Bridge following the defeat on Wednesday night. There have been conflicting claims about the precise nature of the row, but stewards were needed to calm the situation down after Chelsea's 2-1 win. The incident centred around a disagreement between Chelsea fitness coach Paolo Bertelli and Manchester City masseur Mark Sertori, both of whom speak Italian, as the Premier League leaders celebrated their victory. Guardiola said: ""We are so polite in our defeats and we are so polite when we win. When we win, normally we celebrate a little bit, then we go to the locker room.

openai_text-curie-001 (0 shot),Commercial meaderies are producing a more refined form of mead that is gaining in popularity.,"But what's brewing in this new crop of commercial meaderies - as they are known - is lot more refined from the drink that once decorated tables across medieval Europe. ""Do we have any mead makers or home brewers in the group?"" asks Ben Alexander, eying a crowd of a dozen or so people who have come to his Maine Meade Works, in Portland, on a rainy Friday for a tour. When no-one raises their hand, Mr Alexander launches into the full spiel. ""If you guys want to come around, I'll show you how this thing works,"" he says, gesturing to two ceiling-high columns of stainless steel filled with something resembling a mushy golden porridge. ""We mix up honey and water over there and we pump it through a hot water bath at 160 degrees [71C] in a stainless steel coil here. Each one produces about 50 to 75 gallons [227-340 litres] of mead a day,"" explains Mr Alexander. It's fair to say he is obsessed with mead. ""It's the quintessential local beverage - you can go anywhere in the world and find honey to make mead, and I think that's unique among alcoholic beverages,"" he gushes. After being introduced to the drink by a home brewer, Mr Alexander thought there were profits to be had in a commercial meadery. He founded Maine Mead Works in 2008, pouring his savings and money from friends and family into the business. His business has since grown, along with the popularity of mead in the US. It's now a seven-person operation that manufactures more than 7,500 cases a year, shipping them as far away as China. Mr Alexander is not the only one to have caught on to the commercial potential of mead. Vicky Rowe, the owner of mead information website GotMead, says interest in the product in the US has exploded in the past decade. ""We went from 30-40 meaderies making mead to somewhere in the vicinity of 250 in the last 10 years,"" she says. ""I like to say that everything old is new again - people come back to what was good once."" Even visitors to Mr Alexander's meadery agree. Tour participant Dirk Heseman admitted that while Maine Mead Works was the first meadery he'd actually visited, he has noticed that mead ""is becoming more and more available - similar to cider"". Just this year, commercial meaderies in the US have banded together to form an industry group, the American Mead Makers Association, to better share information and encourage growth in the industry. But there's a lot of work that needs to be done to improve the image of a drink long associated with Renaissance fairs and medieval re-enactments. ""I think our number one challenge as an industry is awareness of what mead is,"" says Mr Alexander. ""You ask 10 people in a room if they've ever heard of mead, and two of them might say, 'yes', and only one of them has had a very positive experience."" The mead of the past was often sweet, and didn't appeal to many drinkers",1,5,4

Andy Rhind-Tutt, a former mayor and current chairman of Amesbury Museum, which part-funded the dig, said the discovery could ""provide what archaeologists have been searching for centuries - the answer to the story of the pre-history of Stonehenge."" Earlier this month, the government announced funding for a 1.8-mile (2.9km) tunnel to remove congestion from the main road past Stonehenge.

However, Pakistan's spinners and fielders were able","Pakistan seemed to be cruising to a draw before debutant Adil Rashid - who returned 0-163 in the first innings - turned the match with five wickets. Needing 99 to win, England sent out Jos Buttler and Ben Stokes in the top four. But they were eventually beaten by the fading light, finishing 25 runs short of a famous victory on 74-4. The tourists could not find the boundary frequently enough before the umpires brought the teams off, with Joe Root 33 not out. However, this was a hugely impressive performance from England and one that will fill them with confidence ahead of the second Test in Dubai, which begins on Thursday. After England concluded their innings on 598-9 in the morning, Pakistan looked assured at 113-3 shortly after tea, leading by 38 with seven second-innings wickets remaining. But the match turned when veteran batsman Younus Khan, playing in his 102nd Test match, mistimed a wild heave to give Rashid his first Test wicket - caught at point by Stokes. Rashid - whose figures in the first innings were the worst ever by a debutant - then quickly added a second victim, having Asad Shafiq caught behind for six. The door was opened for England, and Rashid and Moeen Ali barged through it as they polished off the last five wickets for 14 runs. Pakistan skipper Misbah ul-Haq - who had played with restraint for his 51 - inexplicably aimed an uncharacteristic slog at Moeen and was bowled. Moeen then removed Wahab Riaz caught behind, before Rashid claimed the final three wickets - all superbly caught at first slip by James Anderson. England sensed an unlikely victory, but their reorganised batting order could not score quickly enough as Pakistan's tactic of spin from both ends and fielders on the boundary brought them regular wickets. Makeshift opener Buttler was trapped lbw for four, Moeen and Stokes were caught on the boundary in quick succession, and Jonny Bairstow was stumped attempting a big shot. However, in truth it was mistakes earlier in the match that ultimately proved more costly as England fell just short of their first win on the subcontinent since beating India in Kolkata in 2012. In Pakistan's first innings, Ian Bell dropped Mohammad Hafeez (98) and Shafiq (107) at slip early in their innings. And Shoaib Malik, who made 245, was dismissed off a no-ball by Stuart Broad. England captain Alastair Cook, whose record-breaking 263 in the first innings was ultimately in vain, admitted England were frustrated to come so close to victory.

openai_text-curie-001 (0 shot),Former Celtic manager Lennon is coming to Hibs as their new manager. He is expected to help the team achieve promotion to the Scottish Premiership.,"His previous jobs were at Celtic and Bolton, but moving to the second tier of Scottish football was no hindrance to him returning to work at Easter Road. Lennon saw the vacancy as an opportunity, and that was enough to encourage Hibs that a figure of his profile and experience would accept a role in the Championship. Even though his last job in Scotland involved leading a team on Champions League duty, Lennon's mind has not been swayed by haughtiness. The appointment of the former Celtic manager as successor to Alan Stubbs suits both parties, because it is mutually beneficial. Success is alluring, and Hibs offer Lennon the chance to accumulate more achievements. He was immediately engaged in crisis management at his previous club Bolton, but will find stability, potential and accomplishment at Easter Road. The demand will be to deliver promotion, but that will not seem daunting when the majority of the squad that pushed Rangers for a while last season then won the Scottish Cup is still in place. Lennon's task is to refine and bolster the team, when new managers are often faced with a period of overhaul. Stubbs left the club on an emotional high after delivering their first Scottish Cup in 114 years, but before the final against Rangers there was a tangible sense of exasperation that promotion had been missed. Hibs were entitled to feel that it was an unnecessary failure given their circumstances. The club is about to embark on a third season in the Championship, but by most other measures they can be considered a top-flight outfit. The budget will be significantly more than the rest of the teams in the division, the training ground at East Mains and facilities are first-class, the football side of the business is stable and well-run by George Craig, the club's head of football operations, the squad is full of talent. Lennon can rely on consistently assured performances from the likes of David Gray, Darren McGregor, Paul Hanlon, Lewis Stevenson, John McGinn, Fraser Fyvie, Dylan McGeouch, James Keatings and Jason Cummings. Some minor issues remain, such as who will fill the goal next season, but the challenge is more on adding depth and strength of will to the squad and man-management. McGinn, one of the most reliably effective players in the Championship last season, has already insisted that he remains committed to Hibs despite the failure to achieve promotion. The 21-year-old midfielder provides the kind of industry and spirit that a team can be built around. There may be critical decisions to make, though, since Cummings is entering the final year of his contract and so represents a sellable asset. He is a regular goalscorer, though, and Stubbs had to sign Anthony Stokes on loan last January to provide some support up front. These are tweaks compared to the amount of work Stubbs had to carry out when he was appointed two years ago. Hibs are ready to be guided forward, not waiting to be rescued.

The council's head of neighbourhood and strategic housing, Kristine Reeves, was later sacked over the affair. The development proposals, put forward by Norwich City Council, include 60 flats and 45 houses. The report to the council says 35 of the houses and flats will be for social rent. A report to Norwich City Council's planning committee, which meets on Thursday, advises councillors to approve the plans. Elderly residents were moved out of Greyhound Opening and nearby Goldsmith Street seven years ago after Norwich City Council agreed to redevelop the site. The council agreed that new employees relocating to the city could move in temporarily ahead of demolition. However other staff, including Ms Reeves, also moved in, in contravention of council policy. The council resisted calls for a full independent inquiry. Its own investigation found safeguards covering conflicts of interest were in place but not followed. In February 2009, London-based architects Riches Hawley Mikhail won a competition to design a new social housing development on the site, but they were never commissioned. During that year homes on the derelict site were demolished, but the site has since remained untouched.",1,4,4
openai_text-curie-001 (0 shot),Inverness CT manager Richie Foran was disappointed with his team's performance and how they responded after being down 1-0 at half-time. Saints were tactically brilliant and capitalized on their man advantage to win the game.,"Steven Maclean bundled home the opener five minutes before half-time. The hosts, slacker after the break, had beleaguered striker Larnell Cole sent-off after he confronted the referee. Liam Craig sealed the win from the penalty spot with two minutes to play, before Graham Cummins finished a sumptuous stoppage-time move. And things got worse still for Caley Thistle after the match, with captain Gary Warren shown a red card in the tunnel. Saints remain five points clear of Hearts in fourth place, and closed the gap on third-placed Rangers, who play Aberdeen on Sunday, to three points. With game after game ticking past, Inverness' position looks increasingly perilous. Next weekend's trip to Motherwell, second-bottom on goal difference, is now seismic. This contest turned nightmarish for the hosts after a bright opening, but the truth is, given their predicament, Caley Thistle did not threaten St Johnstone's goal enough. Billy Mckay sent a shot over from close range. Alex Fisher nodded a diving header wide. Carl Tremarco miscued a volley. Greg Tansey did draw a save from Alan Mannus when he rasped in an effort from outside the box, but Richie Foran's side never looked likely to find the net. Their best opportunity came immediately after the Saints went ahead, when Tansey fed Cole, who seemed to panic in a terrific position and shot straight at Mannus. Cole's dismissal ended the contest when he appeared to be cautioned twice for challenging referee Stephen Finnie's decision not to award a foul. St Johnstone were merciless and could have had more. With just one win from their last 21 league games, Inverness look deep in trouble. Tommy Wright's side deserve so much credit. Saints were tactically brilliant, so strong defensively and ruthlessly capitalised on their man advantage. They took one of their few first-half chances when Michael Coulson broke down the left and sent a dangerous ball across the six-yard box. Owain Fon Williams could only parry into the danger area, Cummins' shot was blocked but Maclean followed up to force it home. They should have had another when Craig's superb curling corner flew all the way to the back post where Cummins slid in and somehow knocked it over from two yards. Craig, in his 300th appearance for the club, coolly converted a spot-kick after Cummins was tripped to seal the points. Cummins then slammed home after Miller danced around the area to tee him up, before Craig cracked the bar amid the late flurry. With a tendency to finish the season strongly, and just a three-point gap to Rangers, the Perth side look capable of something special this term. Inverness CT manager Richie Foran: ""It is a tough time of the season to be sitting bottom, and I need real men to stand up to that, but not enough of them did that today. ""It is pure luck we are still in it and it is only four points. I sound like a broken record but one win changes it - that is the truth.

The Supreme Court judges said some proposals breached rights to privacy and a family life under the European Convention on Human Rights. However, the court said the aim of the Act, which is intended to promote and safeguard the rights and wellbeing of children and young people, was legitimate. Speaking ahead of his statement to the Scottish Parliament, Mr Swinney said the Scottish government remained ""absolutely committed"" to the Named Person service as a way to support children and their families.

Last month, the Supreme Court ruled that the anthem must be played in every cinema before a film is screened. Some 20 people have been held in Kerala and Tamil Nadu since then for remaining seated during the anthem. Also, India's colonial-era sedition law has been often used against students, journalists, writers and social activists and those critical of the government.

Morocco controls two-thirds of Western Sahara and sees it as part of its historic territory. However some, including the UN, see Western Sahara as Africa's last colony. Africa Live: More on this and other stories Find out more about Western Sahara A referendum was promised in 1991 but never carried out due to wrangling over who was eligible to vote. Thousands of Sahrawi refugees still live in refugee camps in Algeria - some have been there for 40 years. It is not clear what happens next but Western Sahara is hopeful that a committee set up by the AU will address the issues that both sides have raised. Some AU delegates said that it would be easier to resolve the issue with Morocco inside the AU. Sidi Mohammed, a Western Sahara official, told the BBC that Morocco's return to the AU means that it would now be expected to put ""in practice decisions taken by the AU with regard to a referendum in Western Sahara"". Mr Mohammed dismissed the suggestion that Morocco would now seek to get the AU to change its position, saying that the no country could unilaterally change the AU fundamental agreement, saying it opposed colonisation. In his speech at the AU summit, King Mohammed VI of Morocco said the readmission was not meant to divide the continental body. No. Algeria has always been a big supporter of Western Sahara's Polisario Front and it had wanted Morocco to accept independence of the territory as a condition for readmission. Zimbabwe and South Africa were also supportive of this stance but they were outnumbered by those who wanted Morocco back in the fold. There is no specific provision in the AU charter that bars any country from joining it. Morocco simply applied and the request was accepted by more than two-thirds of the 53 members. Morocco has been involved in intense lobbying and applied in July last year to rejoin the continental body. King Mohammed toured various African countries seeking support for the bid. No. While culturally the country's identity aligns with Arab states, its economic interests increasingly lie in Africa. This is a strategic move to continue exploring its interests in mining, construction, medical, insurance and banking sectors on the continent.

The schemes, which exclude cancer referrals, were designed to ""incentivise best quality practice"" and ""drive improvements in the quality of primary medical care.""","GP practices are being paid to help local NHS groups limit the number of patient referrals and cut costs, the doctors' magazine Pulse found. Appointments affected include scans and consultations with specialists - including those for cancer patients. The British Medical Association said such incentives were ""misguided"". At least nine clinical commissioning groups (CCGs) were offering GP practices payments for hitting targets, according to Pulse's investigation. In one case, Birmingham South Central CCG was offering practices more than Â£11,000 to reduce new outpatient attendances, follow-ups, A&E attendances and emergency admissions by 1%, compared with 2014/15. It said the schemes, which exclude cancer referrals, were designed to ""incentivise best quality practice"" and ""drive improvements in the quality of primary medical care"". ""Our priority is to ensure that patients have access to services that they need, when they need them,"" said a spokesperson for Birmingham South Central CCG. Another CCG told Pulse it had considered the ""full impact"" of the incentive scheme and was ""confident that there is no conflict of interest"". Pulse said that one scheme had already been looked at by the General Medical Council, the body which regulates medical standards in the UK, after local GP leaders expressed their concern. The magazine pointed out that initial hospital referrals for cancer patients should happen within two weeks of a GP first suspecting the condition. Dr Chand Nagpaul, chairman of the GPs committee of the doctors' trade union the British Medical Association, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that such schemes were a ""financial contaminant"" to patient-doctor trust. He said: ""It's short-sighted and misguided of CCGs to introduce such mechanisms, because they do lead to the potential for patients questioning the motives of GP referrals. ""We believe it is far more appropriate for CCGs to introduce clinical pathways that ensure patients are referred appropriately rather than these crude, salesman-like bonuses which pay GPs simply to make reduction to referrals in numerical terms."" Dr Peter Melton is local GP and clinical chief officer for North East Lincolnshire CCG, which offers the equivalent of more than Â£6,000 to practices that reduce outpatient referrals to the same level as the 25% with the lowest referral rates (which include two-week urgent cancer referrals) in 2014/15. He said the CCG was already among the best in England for referring suspected cancer patients to a consultant within two weeks and the scheme was not about avoiding sending people to hospital. ""It is not focussing on referral reduction per se but on better clinical and quality standards for the patient,"" he explained. ""The expectation is practices will be encouraged to investigate more locally and monitor the patient in the first instance rather than automatically refer in to a secondary care service.""

Some of the items found included an armour-piercing improvised rocket and two anti-personnel mines. The main line of police inquiry is the arms belonged to dissident republicans. Last week, Home Secretary Theresa May said MI5 believed an attack on targets in Great Britain by dissident republicans had become ""a strong possibility"". Analysis: Vincent Kearney, BBC News NI's home affairs correspondent The discovery of what appears to be a second dissident republican arms dump near Larne within three months has left police baffled. Based on location alone, the analysis would be that the items found most likely belonged to loyalist paramilitaries. But the nature of what was found suggests otherwise and the finger of suspicion firmly in the direction of dissident republicans. Det Supt Kevin Geddes said the threat level in Northern Ireland from dissident republican groups remains ""severe"" and an attack is ""highly likely"". Police officers found three barrels hidden in holes in the forest. As well as rockets and mines, there were also several pipe bombs, assault rifle ammunition and parts to construct a ""substantial number of explosive devices"". Det Supt Geddes said the seizure was significant ""both in terms of its size and its capability"". ""A number of these devices were ready to be deployed,"" he added. ""This seizure has undoubtedly saved lives."" He said the type of weapons that had been found meant police would focus their investigation on dissident republicans.

openai_text-curie-001 (0 shot),Ricky Burns became the first Scot to win world titles at three weights by defeating Michele Di Rocco.,"With three defeats in his previous six bouts, the Scottish boxer's career seemed to be on the wane. But his power, timing and focus returned in a supremely confident display at Glasgow's Hydro on Saturday night as he clinched the vacant WBA World Super-Lightweight title - and entered the record books as the first Scot to win world titles at three weights. Italy's Michele Di Rocco, at 34 a year older than Burns, hadn't lost a fight since September 2007. He arrived with a record of 40 wins and a draw from 42 bouts. He left a lesser figure. The referee deemed the man from Assisi to be in no state to continue in the eighth round, the result of a welter of blows to his head and body and made all the more unbearable by the hostile acoustic energy generated by 8,000 Scottish fans. Surely, for Burns, this was time to shout about his record, the ideal moment to counter all those who had written him off and questioned the wisdom of him leaving trainer Billy Nelson two years ago to work with Tony Sim in Essex? No. Instead, the champion spoke of his disbelief at the ease of his victory, his gratitude that he was safe, of his thanks to promoter Eddie Hearn, manager Alex Morrison and coach Sim for believing in him, and of his desire to celebrate with a fast-food burger and 20 chicken nuggets. ""When I got in the ring after the fight, I said, 'You've done it! You've done it!',"" reported a beaming Hearn at the post-fight media conference. ""And you know what Ricky said? 'Can you get a picture with me and Michael Buffer [the legendary American boxing ring announcer]?'"" When he has time to reflect during a well-earned holiday, Burns will take immense satisfaction at being only the third British-born fighter, after Bob Fitzsimmons and Duke McKenzie, to be a three-weight world champion. In Scottish terms, his achievements must mean that he is in the very top tier of boxing greats, comfortably mentioned in the same breath as former world champions Benny Lynch, Walter McGowan, Jackie Paterson, Ken Buchanan and Jim Watt, for example. Burns' record stands at 40 wins from 46 bouts. Remarkably, 11 of those have been world title fights. Buchanan's exploits in the United States add lustre to his legacy, but while Burns may never have fought someone like Roberto Duran, should Hearn manage to set up a bout against Cincinnati's Adrien Broner, the four-time world champion stripped of the WBA title because he could not make the weight, then Burns could achieve little more in the sport. ""There are some big fights out there for me,"" said Burns. ""I want to fight the top names. I will fight anybody. I do super-lightweight comfortably and lightweight is still an option. I would fight Terence Crawford again if it came down to it. ""That's nearly two years I have been with Tony and things have just started clicking. ""I had a bit of a bad run in the last year with stuff.",1,5,4

Following on, he then made 68 in Surrey's 166-3 to keep Hampshire at bay and prompt handshakes at 16:50 BST. The draw sees third-placed Hampshire claim 12 points, while Surrey take 10 points and stay sixth in Division One. Burns' epic effort saw him stay in the field for all but 10 overs of the entire match, as he defied Hampshire's bowling efforts on a flat Oval pitch. The left-hander was dropped twice in the slip cordon in his career-best 219, but was the only one to resist as Ian Holland (3-37) dismissed Tom Curran (53), Amar Virdi and Mark Footitt to force the follow-on after Surrey began the day on 410-7. Mark Stoneman (47) and Burns then put on an opening stand of 109 before Holland's medium pace had Stoneman lbw and Scott Borthwick bowled in a single over. Sean Ervine became the only man to dismiss Burns in 756 minutes of play when he missed a ball down the leg side, but Jason Roy and Dominic Sibley continued on until the conclusion. Surrey captain Rory Burns told BBC Radio London: ""I'm really pleased that we've fought that hard to get the draw and the extra five points, and obviously pretty happy with how I've played. ""We had to bat seven sessions to get us to safety and that's all I was thinking. ""There were some jitters in the nineties and I got a lifeline, which was quite nice. When I was getting close to 200, I was more thinking about the situation of getting to the follow-on mark. ""They're a good side and they played really well.

College principal Chris Wilkes said the decision was related to ""low student numbers rather than any other reason"". He said it would continue to focus on adult education. Famous Ruskin College alumni include former deputy prime minister John Prescott and Dennis Skinner, MP for Bolsover in Derbyshire. BA English Studies, BA History with Social Sciences and MA Women's Studies are being discontinued. Anne Hughes, 63, from Thame in Oxfordshire, has been studying BA English Studies part-time at the college for two years. She said she was ""absolutely distraught"" it was being cut. She is physically disabled and has depression, and said she chose to study at the college because it worked with ""disadvantaged, disabled and mature students"". The college also offers bespoke timetables, unlike some other places of higher education, she added. Online petitions have been set up in a bid to save the English faculty and the Women's Studies course. One signatory, Jenny Lewis, wrote on the first petition: ""[Tutors] Helen Kidd and Tom Sherry are carrying on the great Ruskin tradition of bringing opportunities to those that otherwise would not have them."" Student and activist Saskia Ritchie, who set up the second petition, said Ruskin had been set up for ""people who would traditionally be excluded from academia"" and gives ""access to truly excellent learning opportunities"". Mr Wilkes said the college would lose about 25 students as a result of the cuts. He added degrees had been on offer at the college for about 10 years and were ""relatively new"" considering the college's 116-year history. ""Our focus will continue to be on educating adults and I think what we're doing is just renewing our offer but doing it in a different way, fulfilling our mission in a different way, to perhaps how we've done it in the past,"" Mr Wilkes added.

The cuts are being blamed on reduced government spending and a drop in National Lottery ticket sales - a major contributor to sports backing. Governing bodies are bracing themselves for potential job losses. About 60% of funding is made up from Scottish Government money, with lottery sales making up the rest. In the year ending 2015, total revenue was £65.1m, which is divided up and awarded to 52 sports. By the end of next year, that figure will have fallen to £51.8m - a cut to the Scottish sporting budget of 20% in just three years. sportscotland chairman Mel Young said: ""It's heartbreaking to me because I know the effort the sport governing bodies and the community that's around it; the volunteers and the mums and dads. ""And, to have to say that we're having to cut some money back is, I believe, not the right way to go."" Former badminton player Susan Egelstaff, a double bronze medallist at the Commonwealth Games [in 2002 and 2006] and an Olympian, fears the cuts will have ""a huge impact"". ""What that means in the future is that Scotland will be constantly playing catch-up,"" she said. ""It's almost impossible to catch up if you fall too far behind the leading nations."" The Scottish Government said sport and physical activity play a ""key role"" in a healthy Scotland and that ""significant"" investment would continue in those areas. ""Having successfully delivered the Commonwealth Games [in 2014] we are now focusing on protecting or raising investment in areas intended to decrease health inequality and improve life chances, and the small reduction in the sport budget allows us to support those priorities,"" Minister for Sport Aileen Campbell said. ""There is on-going support for active lifestyles through capital investment in cycling and walking, and over the last 10 years we have invested £168m in sport infrastructure - from grassroots to the elite performance which has increased the facilities and opportunities to get people active and achieve on the world stage at both the Olympics and Commonwealth Games.""",1,5,5

She said that, although Carlisle had made a ""positive contribution"" to others through football, she had to sentence him for the risk his ""erratic"" driving had created.

Freezing care provider fees to save money was no long sustainable, it said. Ministers say extra money will help NHS and social care services work together. The survey, which was completed by 147 directors of adult social services for councils in England, suggests that funding reductions to social care budgets have totalled £4.6bn since 2010 - a 31% overall reduction. Budgets for adult social care - which provides practical support to people due to illness, disability, old age or a low income - will reduce by a further £500m in cash terms this year, it said. ""Taking the growth in numbers of older and disabled people into account, this means that an additional £1.1bn would be needed to provide the same level of service as last year,"" the report warned. It said some councils had made savings in the past by freezing fees paid to providers, but care providers were now also facing financial problems. Some companies - particularly those in southern England - are struggling to attract staff, amid increasing concern about the quality of care, it said. ""What is at stake is the continuing capacity of adult social care to sustain services to those in greatest need,"" ADASS president Ray James said. ""In virtually all our authorities, the number in need is growing, while the complexity of their needs is increasing."" ADASS called for the government to ""protect essential care and support services to the most vulnerable members of our community"". But a government spokesman said the survey ""ignores"" a commitment to invest £10bn in health services that are being ""joined up"" with social care, by 2020. The BBC has launched an online guide to the care system for the over-65s. The ""care calculator"" covers residential care and the support provided in people's own homes, for tasks such as washing and dressing. Users can submit their postcode and find out how much each service costs where they live in the UK. There is also a dedicated BBC Cost of Care website, with news stories, analysis and video. The spokesman said: ""Increasing budgets isn't the only solution. By working innovatively and joining up health and social care we can improve care and also save money."" However, Councillor Izzi Seccombe, from the Local Government Association (LGA), said adult social care services were facing ""enormous pressures"" due to ""insufficient funding, growing demand and escalating costs"". ""We have long warned that investing in the NHS whilst social care budgets are under continual pressure is simply a false economy. ""It is social care services that support elderly and vulnerable people to maintain their independence, live in their own community and stay out of hospital longer,"" she added.

Earlier, every stage at the event was closed after lightning struck ground. Dance act Rudimental were escorted off the main stage mid-set, and had to abandon their planned encore - Feel The Love, with guest vocalist John Newman. ""We're quite upset,"" musician Amir Amor told the BBC, ""but we had a great time anyway"". Metallica's Lars Ulrich was flying into the site by helicopter as the storm descended. ""It was kind of frightening,"" he said. ""When we landed, all the people picking us up were going, 'we didn't expect you were going to fly in this weather'. ""But the pilot didn't say anything about that. We saw the lightning up there. I thought it was pyrotechnics for Arcade Fire.""

Other performers on Friday included Blondie, who proved so popular it became impossible to enter or leave The Other Stage at lunchtime, and Paolo Nutini, whose soulful ballads were a fitting soundtrack as dusk fell over Somerset. Sophie Ellis-Bextor sneaked some disco into her set at the largely-acoustic Avalon Stage, while the pulsing synthpop of Glaswegian band Chvrches made for a steamy atmosphere in the John Peel tent as fans danced off the downpour. Arcade Fire took to the stage shortly after 22:00 BST, their arrival heralded by a man dressed from head-to-toe in a mirrored suit. Bravely, considering the weather conditions, the 12-piece band were largely dressed in white, but if they were worried about laundry bills, it didn't show.

At the party's weekly press briefing, I asked the Welsh Conservative leader Andrew RT Davies, who was elected on the list, whether he'd stand as a constituency candidate in his home turf of the Vale of Glamorgan but he said he hadn't thought about it. Presumably those are the kind of decisions they will now feel more confident contemplating. The party will also have a huge amount of new data on voters which it'll be able to call upon and the belief that campaigning hard on the NHS helped the Tories cross the line in places like the Vale of Clwyd and Gower. The Conservatives feel it's them, rather than any of the other opposition parties, who have become the repository of votes from those who are disaffected by the state of the NHS. Welsh Labour are going to hold a ""short sharp"" analysis into what went wrong. Carwyn Jones was in line with most of the criticism of Ed Miliband when he told AMs that the party needed to appeal to small business owners who are not millionaires but who work hard. What will be more difficult is countering the argument on the NHS, which the former minister Alun Davies believes is already lost. Another potential difficulty for Welsh Labour will be dealing with unhappiness within the party over council re-organisation. Bernie Attridge, the deputy leader of Flintshire Council, has tweeted saying the party needs to be careful on local government reform if it wants to retain the support of grassroots councillors. It also seems to have been the case that Labour lost more votes to UKIP than the Conservatives, which is another challenge to overcome. But Labour will at least have the advantage that it will be David Cameron, and not Ed Miliband, carrying out the latest round of public sector cuts that are likely to take effect sooner rather than later. The question is whether Carwyn Jones is going to be able to turn that to his advantage when his own record in government will be under scrutiny. Plaid Cymru's education spokesman, Simon Thomas, also in the party's weekly press briefing, said he believed Leanne Wood could portray herself as an alternative first minister because of the way she emotionally connected with people in the campaign. The party now has a year to make that a credible proposition after it failed to gain any new seats and came fourth, behind UKIP, in the overall share of the vote, despite her unprecedented profile. He also said that on the campaign trail people wanted to know what Plaid was going to do about the NHS and that people ""did not see the strengths"" of its arguments.

Currently, more than 5,500 children are in foster care in Scotland, living with 4,400 families and carers. The Fostering Network surveyed 250 children, teenagers and foster carers across Scotland and discovered that many young people had failed to find stability. Almost half were already living with their third family, a quarter were with their fourth family and about 20 were living with their 10th family since going into care. There was a particular need for homes to be found for vulnerable teenagers, siblings and disabled children, the study found. Carla, 23, was taken into care at the age of 12 and had eight foster homes before moving in with the Randalls. ""Looking back now I realised that the Randalls saved my life,"" she said. ""I never understood the extent of the neglect and abuse I had endured until I came to live with a 'normal' loving family. ""They were just always themselves, the smallest details meant so much to me. ""They nurtured a young, angry, untrusting teenager to become a positive, empathetic and successful young woman."" The Fostering Network said instability had a detrimental effect on the child's education and wellbeing, while finding a stable foster carer from the outset could lead to improved relationships and a happier childhood. Sara Lurie, director of the Fostering Network Scotland, said: ""As each year passes, we see more and more children coming into care. ""We need people who can open their heart, and their homes, to vulnerable children and young people and use their skills to help support them to reach their full potential.

That is down from 6.1% in the previous quarter. Analysts were expecting the same figure for January to March. India is the third-largest economy in Asia but has been struggling with inflation and currency weakness. Since July last year, the Indian rupee has seen one of the biggest declines among Asian currencies, dropping more than 27% against the US dollar. ""Shocking numbers as growth was even lower than lows witnessed during the financial crisis,"" said Anubhuti Sahay from Standard Chartered Bank in Mumbai. The BBC's Yogita Limaye in Mumbai said that just a year ago India was aspiring for double-digit growth. But a global slowdown has reduced external demand, and high inflation coupled with a weak rupee has made things more expensive within the country. Domestic demand, which India's economy is largely reliant on, has also slowed in part due to the political upheaval in the country. India's economy is suffering from ""policy incoherence, shifting global risk appetite and a comatose government"", said Rajeev Malik, senior economist at brokerage CLSA India's Prime Minister Manmohan Singh admitted early this month that his government must do more to get the once fast-growing economy moving again. The Congress-led coalition government is caught up in a slew of corruption scandals. Key policy reforms, including allowing foreign investment in India's retail sector, have been delayed in parliament for more than a year. This has worried foreign investors and threatened the country's investment grade credit rating. ""This is definitely a very important signal for the government - this is a make or break situation for India and the government has to step on the panic button,"" said Rupa Rege Nitsure, chief economist at Bank of Baroda in Mumbai.

Wrockwardine Wood and Sutherland academies, also run by the Telford Co-operative Multi-Academy Trust, were put in special measures earlier this week. The trust has not commented. Ofsted criticised the trust's lack of support to the schools and said each was now considering an alternative sponsor. Inspectors said pupils' achievement at the Phoenix Academy had dropped since it became an academy in 2013 and their latest report rated it inadequate in all areas. A report in 2013, before it converted, rated the secondary school as ""requiring improvement"", while Lakeside was rated ""good"" in 2012 under its former name the Lord Silkin School. In the latest report, inspectors said the curriculum at Phoenix Academy was ""inadequate"", while ""weak teaching"" meant pupils were not sufficiently challenged and were often ""disengaged and disruptive"". There was particular criticism of standards in English and maths which the watchdog said were limiting pupils' achievements in other areas. Ofsted's report said governors, managers and teachers had developed a ""culture of low expectations"", while leaders had failed to act decisively to halt the decline in pupils' achievement. There was, however, some praise for the acting head teacher. Inspectors said he had introduced a number of improvement measures and some were ""beginning to have an impact"". A report on Lakeside School highlighted similar concerns, criticising teachers for not sufficiently challenging pupils and for having ""over generous"" predictions of their achievement. Inspectors said many pupils, whether high achievers or those with special educational needs, were ""not making the progress they should"" and achievements at GCSE were well below the national average. Governors were also criticised for not holding leaders to account, while the report said management had failed to effectively monitor either pupils or teachers.

A reading below 50 indicates falling output. It is the first time that activity in the sector has fallen since March 2013. Firms blamed soft domestic demand, a fall in new business from overseas and uncertainty ahead of the EU referendum. A slowdown in the oil and gas industry, a major customer for UK companies, is also hitting production. The index for new orders fell to 50.4 in April, from 51.9 the month before, matching February's three-year low. Rob Dobson, senior economist at Markit, said: ""On this evidence manufacturing production is now falling at a quarterly pace of around 1%, and will likely act as a drag on the economy again during the second quarter and putting greater pressure on the service sector to sustain GDP growth. ""The manufacturing labour market is also being impacted, with the data signalling close to 20,000 job losses over the past three months."" Last week, official figures showed UK economic growth slowed to 0.4% in the first quarter of the year from 0.6% in late 2015, propped up by the services sector. David Noble, group chief executive at the Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply (CIPS), said: ""Recent fears over a stall in the UK's manufacturing sector have now become a reality. ""An atmosphere of deep unease is building throughout the manufacturing supply chain, eating away at new orders, reducing British exports and putting more jobs at risk. ""A sense of apprehension across the sector is being caused by enduring volatility in the oil and gas industry, falling retailer confidence and the uncertainty created by the EU referendum."" The Markit/CIPS survey found new export orders contracted for the fourth straight month in April as the global economy continued to slow. A measure of employment in the manufacturing sector was also below the 50 mark for its fourth straight month. Lee Hopley, chief economist at the manufacturers' organisation, EEF, said: ""The sharp drop to a three-year low and another month of reported job cuts could be the clearest sign yet that referendum uncertainty is starting to weigh on the real economy.

The couple spoke out in response to consultation on proposed reform of sentencing for driving offences. They believe increased sentences should be backed up by manslaughter charges. Mr Moores, 28, was killed by a Vauxhall Astra driven by Donna Hackett on the M4 near Swindon. Hackett, then aged 26, fled and was found by police asleep in a ditch. She served half of a six-year jail term after she was found guilty of causing death by careless driving while drunk. The Ministry of Justice consultation suggests offenders who cause death by careless driving while under the influence of drink or drugs could soon be handed a life sentence - an increase on the current 14-year upper limit.

The ruling preserves the law known as Obamacare, which Mr Obama considers a major part of his presidential legacy. Republicans have vowed to continue fighting the law. ""We've got more work to do, but what we're not going to do is unravel what has now been woven into the fabric of America,"" Mr Obama said. The case, known as King v Burwell, was the second major challenge the law has faced in the US's highest court. Unlike in many other western countries, the US does not have a single-payer healthcare system. Private companies, rather than the US government, provide health insurance for US citizens. The enactment of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) - one of Mr Obama's most significant and controversial domestic achievements - in 2010 mandated that every American had to purchase private insurance. It provided the subsidies to allow many to do so. In 2012, the mandate portion of the law was challenged in the court. The justices ruled to preserve it. In that decision, as in the decision on Thursday, Chief Justice John Roberts surprised observers by siding with his liberal colleagues in support of the law. ""Congress passed the Affordable Care act to improve health insurance markets, not to destroy them,"" Chief Justice John Roberts wrote in the opinion. Justice Anthony Kennedy dissented in 2012, but sided with the majority on Thursday. Had the court made the opposite decision, an estimated 8.7 million people in the US would have been at risk of losing the aid that makes healthcare affordable. The stakes could not have been higher. People's health (crucially important) and Obama's legacy (less important, but for him and those around him fairly vital) were at stake. Well a politically finely balanced Supreme Court has given an emphatic, overwhelming vote in favour of the president by 6-3. I bet ""No-drama Obama"" is high-fiving anyone and everyone in the White House - that is how big it is. Obama defies lame-duck expectations Demonstrators gathered outside the court as early on Thursday morning. Reading updates on their mobile phones, the crowd became jubilant when they learned mid-morning that the court had ruled in their favour. Some began dancing, while others chanted ""If you're covered and you know it clap your hands."" ""This is a big sigh of relief for millions across the country,"" said Ron Pollack of Families USA, a health-care advocacy organisation.

Uhuru Kenyatta, who faces trial at the International Criminal Court, has been leading in early presidential results declared from Monday's tightly contested election. He is due to stand trial at The Hague next month for allegedly fuelling violence after the disputed 2007 election. He denies the charge. His closest rival is outgoing Prime Minister Raila Odinga. With provisional results in from more than 40% of polling stations earlier on Wednesday, Mr Odinga had 42% of the vote compared with Mr Kenyatta's 53%. However, Mr Odinga's allies remain confident that he will gain ground as results from his strongholds, including the Coast Province, are declared.

The BBC's Solomon Mugera in the capital, Nairobi, says Kenyans are becoming increasingly anxious about the delay in finalising the results.

It's full of light. It's busy. The building has regenerated the area around Melton Mowbray's railway station, once a muddy pot-holed piece of wasteland where those in the know parked for free. Now the council offices link the station to a park and the town centre. It was partly paid for with insurance money after a fire destroyed the old offices on the other side of town. A supermarket moved in to replace it and helped with the money too, putting the council on a firm financial footing. But that was four years ago and the crisis is a different one today. It's being experienced by all local authorities - cuts in central government funding which threaten the services they provide. Mr Rhodes is also deputy leader of Leicestershire County Council, with responsibility for finance. Leicestershire is historically the poorest funded council in the country because of a quirk of Whitehall recalculations, going back a quarter of a century since the poll tax, or community charge, was scrapped. At the moment councils get income from council tax, a share of the business rates, any income they generate themselves from services plus a grant from central government. It's the grant cut which is causing them grief. What's called the ""core funding"" is worked out by the number of homes multiplied by a set amount. And each authority has a different value set per dwelling. If we look at Surrey, which is top of the table, the amount will be £1,686 by 2019/20. Nottinghamshire is mid-table at £1,482, Derbyshire is in the lower reaches with £1,422 per dwelling and then comes Leicestershire at £1,354. ""The funding system is chaotic,"" says Byron Rhodes. ""It doesn't reflect real need. Look at Oxfordshire which is an interesting example,"" he says with a glint in his eye. Could he possibly be referring to the prime ministerial plea to the county council about cutbacks to services there? ""If we had the same funding as Oxfordshire, we'd have £50m a year extra. If we had the same as Surrey, we'd have £100m more. We'd be partying everyday if we had that kind of money."" Leicestershire have been helped with a small share of what's been called transitional funding - about £300m to help councils following pressure from Conservative MPs. Think back to the vote on Sunday trading. With a majority of only 17 in the Commons, the Conservatives lost the vote when 20 odd rebelled. Last month there would've been another rebellion, including some of our own Tory MPs in the East Midlands, if something wasn't done to improve the local government finance settlement over the next four years. The money has gone largely to shire counties. Leicestershire got £6.6m spread over two years, enough to save some services from closure.

Since then, efforts have been continuing to rescue it from closure and save the jobs of its 11,000 staff. Last week, a surprise late bid led by retail veteran Greg Tufnell transformed the race to acquire the retailer. His team, said to be backed by Portuguese money, is the front-runner. But if a deal cannot be struck, the business may still have to be liquidated. The remaining bidders have faded into the background. Another consortium led by Matalan tycoon John Hargreaves and Turkish retail entrepreneur Cafer Mahiroglu has reportedly run into difficulties, while other suitors have apparently failed to impress with their proposals. Some of those involved in the different bids have impressive retailing histories. But then Sir Philip Green, who controlled BHS from 2000 to 2015, also had a brilliant track record. And he ended up selling the business for Â£1. So what are the chances of saving BHS from the liquidators? And just who are the people aiming to do it? In the public eye, Greg Tufnell is easily overshadowed by his more famous brother Phil, the former England cricketer. But that could change if his bid for BHS is successful, because he hopes to become the firm's next chairman. And as far as his credentials for the job are concerned, the 54-year-old executive certainly talks the talk. He describes himself as ""a highly experienced managing director with Mothercare and Arcadia, a blend of entrepreneur, strategist and hands-on operator with significant commercial business turnaround, acquisition and fund-raising experience"". His record shows that he was buying and merchandising director at Next from 1991 to 1994. He then spent three years as managing director of menswear retailer Burton, part of the Arcadia group, followed by another three years as managing director of Mothercare. He currently appears to occupy a portfolio of different jobs, including the chairmanships of leather accessories brand Zatchels and recruitment consultancy hga Group.

Until Mr Tufnell's bid turned up, many observers had assumed that BHS would be snapped up by Matalan founder Mr Hargreaves. But it appears that the cost of a deal may have proved too high. Sources say Mr Hargreaves was asked to improve his offer and balked. Like Sir Philip Green, 71-year-old John Hargreaves also enjoys the life of the super-rich. He has an estimated fortune of Â£1bn, according to the Sunday Times Rich List. But in stark contrast to the ebullient Sir Philip, Mr Hargreaves is described by industry insiders as quiet-spoken, someone who shuns the limelight. Mr Hargreaves is no longer directly involved in the business he founded. He sold his 69% stake in Matalan in 2000, then in 2006 took it private through Missouri Bidco, a company 53.5% owned by him and his family.

The permit does not allow the company to carry out fracking - hydraulic fracturing of the land - to extract any oil or gas.

""Once the work begins, our officers will regulate and monitor the site to ensure it complies with the conditions of the permit, to protect people and the environment."" The permit for exploratory drilling comes despite a moratorium on fracking in Wales pending devolution of responsibility for such decisions. In August, the UK government urged councils in England to speed up the process of approval for fracking projects. However, Natural Resources Minister Carl Sargeant said fracking technology was ""unproven"", and that Welsh Labour ministers preferred to look at renewable energy.",1,5,4

But despite the church's best efforts the bats are not moving and are soiling the altar and church furniture, leaving the church with an ""appalling smell"". The creatures are protected by law and cannot be wilfully disturbed. Volunteers at the church have been working for the past decade to keep the altar, stonework and woodwork clean. But the bats, roosting in the higher areas of the church continually soil the interior of the building with urine and faeces. Church warden Liz Cowley said keeping the 11th Century building in good shape was difficult. She said: ""You can see the urine marks (on the altar), they won't go away. ""If people were coming in here damaging an ancient building like this, you would say it was criminal damage. ""The smell is appalling, it's a combination of ammonia from the urine and a musty smell from the droppings that catches at the back of the throat."" Members of the church had spent Â£10,000 trying to get the bats to move and had paid for specially-built lofts nearby. The Rev Paul Mothersdale, the Rector of St Hilda's Church, said a lot of money had been invested in trying to persuade the bats to move out of the church. The Rev Mothersdale said: ""We've tried to do everything that English Nature, or Natural England, have wanted us to do. ""Money has been spent, not only by the congregation, not only out of church funds, but local people have mucked in and helped. ""And yet we're no further forward, we're still as we were 10 years ago."" Lucy Bellini, of Natural England, said the bats had to be carefully monitored. Ms Bellini said: ""It is a really regionally important roost.

Political leaders, businesses, sporting organisations, and charities will meet at Lancaster House on Thursday. Mr Cameron says corruption is ""the root of so many of the world's problems"". He also described it as ""an enemy of progress"". ""It destroys jobs and holds back economic growth, traps the poorest in desperate poverty, and undermines our security by pushing people towards extremist groups,"" he added. ""The battle against corruption will not be won overnight. It will take time, courage and determination to deliver the reforms that are necessary. But we cannot hope to solve the major global challenges we face without tackling the exploitation, fraud and dishonesty at their heart.

Russia is to be represented by deputy foreign minister Oleg Syromolotov. Panellists are expected to include World Bank president Jim Yong Kim and International Monetary Fund's managing director Christine Lagarde. Under the prime minister's plans, leaders at the summit would pledge to expose corruption and pursue and punish those who perpetrate, facilitate or are complicit in it. Campaigners have also called for a crackdown on tax havens linked to the United Kingdom.

It was sent to UKIP's national executive committee (NEC) before a row over racial slurs about a Labour MP, for which Ms Brown apologised. But UKIP chairman Paul Oakden said the letter did not follow proper process. A UKIP assembly group spokesman said the letter was written by a group with a ""long-standing grudge"" against the AM. The ruling NEC body discussed the issue at a meeting on Friday, where they also decided to allow a controversial anti-Islam campaigner to run for the UKIP leadership. Mr Oakden said: ""A member of the NEC had contacted the person that is putting this forward and said to them they need to follow the proper process of completing the necessary forms and submitting them to the NEC.

""Her lack of effort in pursuing the aims of the party both locally and nationally is of concern to members across the region."" Mr Owen added he believed members would stop supporting UKIP if Ms Brown remained in the role. However, a spokesman for the party's assembly group dismissed the letter as written by a ""tiny and insignificant group"". In February, Ms Brown denied an allegation she had smoked recreational drugs in a hotel room.

Internet companies will also be required to allow Russian authorities access to users' information. One human rights group called the move ""draconian"". The law was approved by Russia's upper house of parliament in April. It includes measures to ensure that bloggers cannot remain anonymous, and states that social networks must maintain six months of data on its users. The information must be stored on servers based in Russian territory, so that government authorities can gain access. Critics see it as the latest in a series of recent moves to curb internet freedom. Hugh Williamson, of New York-based Human Rights Watch, has called the law ""another milestone in Russia's relentless crackdown on free expression"". ""The internet is the last island of free expression in Russia and these draconian regulations are clearly aimed at putting it under government control,"" he added. Opposition figures have used the internet to air their views, with some gaining millions of followers. Commentators opposing Vladimir Putin often face restrictions in broadcast outlets and newspapers. Analysis: Famil Ismailov, news editor, BBCRussian.com Russian bloggers are bracing themselves for the moment when Russia's new ""information security law"" comes into force on 1 August. Some already share advice on how to use proxy servers in order to access social media sites that, in their view, are under threat of being closed. It is hard to see how the law will be enforced. The servers for most of the popular social media platforms that many Russians use are based outside Russia. Many popular bloggers are already looking for, and apparently finding, ways to ""cheat"" the feature that counts page visits and keep their daily unique visitor numbers just under 3000, or to make sure that the statistics are hidden altogether. Anton Nossik, who is considered Russia's ""internet guru"", wrote in his LiveJournal blog that the new law didn't threaten individual bloggers directly, but provided legal grounds to block popular social networks like Facebook, Twitter, LiveJournal and Google. ""The issue of banning all these platforms in Russia is a political one and it will be decided by only one person"", Mr Nossik wrote, with a thinly veiled reference to President Vladimir Putin. Earlier in the year, Russia enacted a law that gave the government powers to block websites without explanation. In March, Moscow blocked the blog of Mr Navalny, along with two news sites and a organisation run by Garry Kasparov - a vocal critic of the Russian government. In a statement, Russia's prosecutor general's office said the blocks were imposed because of the sites' role in helping stage illegal protests. Earlier this week, Twitter blocked access to an anti-Kremlin account that often publishes leaked government documents, following a request by Russia's federal communications agency Roskomnadzor. For many years, Russia had relatively lax internet laws. However Moscow has recently changed its tune, with Mr Putin branding the internet an ongoing ""CIA project"". He also claimed that",1,3,4

It also says they should not ratify a similar deal that has already been done between the EU and Canada. It says some aspects pose a threat to democracy and the rule of law. One of the concerns mentioned in the petition is the idea of tribunals that foreign investors would be able to use in some circumstances to sue governments. There is a great deal of controversy over exactly what this system, known as Investor State Dispute Settlement, would enable companies to do, but campaigners see it as an opportunity for international business to get compensation for government policy changes that adversely affect them. This kind of provision exists in many bilateral trade and investment agreements. Friends of the Earth have published new research on the impact they have had on EU countries. Information about these cases is not always made public, but the group says that going back to 1994, foreign investors have sought compensation of almost €30bn (£24bn) from 20 states. Where the results are known (a small minority of the total), the tribunals have awarded total compensation of €3.5bn (about £2.8bn). In Britain, the possible implications of this provision for the National Health Service have been especially controversial. Campaigners believe that the investor tribunals would make it harder to reverse any decisions to contract services out to international healthcare firms. John Hilary of War on Want said: TTIP ""will make it impossible for any future government to repeal the Health & Social Care Act and bring the NHS back into public hands"". The petition lists a number of other areas where its signatories believes European standards would suffer if the TTIP negotiations are completed and the Canada deal is ratified: employment, social, environmental, privacy and consumer protection. The European Commission says the EU will not have to sacrifice its high standards. It also says investor protection provisions are important for investment flows and have in general worked well. But it accepts there is a need for improvement and is trying to achieve that in its bilateral negotiations. The petition has been organised as an exercise called a European Citizens' Initiative which can lead to a public hearing in the European Parliament and require the European Commission to give a formal response explaining why it is accepting or rejecting what the petitioners call for. The European Commission has already said that the petition doesn't qualify as such an Initiative. Campaigners have launched a legal challenge to this decision.",1,4,4

The apes began to disappear from the documents about 150 years ago, corresponding with population growth. The study is published in the Proceedings of the Royal Society B. Hainan gibbons are now limited to a few isolated patches of forest in the south west of China. They live in just four social groups, one of which was only discovered a few weeks ago. Understanding this population crash has been difficult, but the old government documents have helped to reveal when and how the numbers fell. Dr Sam Turvey, from the Zoological Society of London, said: ""China is one of the few places in the world that has a very very rich, long historical record. ""Because it has had such a complex bureaucracy for so long, there has been a lot of need for reporting - not just numbers of households for tax purposes and things like that, but also in terms of the kinds of natural resources that were available in the immediate environment."" These included records of animals, including gibbons, he said. ""We looked at the pattern of disappearance of gibbons through time and how that varied from place to place and the different environmental conditions and human pressures that were also present in these places."" The archives show that gibbons were a common sight in about 20 provinces in China well into the 17th and 18th Century. However, Dr Turvey said it was ""a stark contrast to their very imperilled position today"". ""We see a really steep increase in population decline and real population collapse across China about 100-150 years ago,"" he added. ""And this correlates with demographic expansion in China towards the end of the Imperial era and through the 20th Century, and the massive increase in deforestation and human population growth through the time of the Chinese Republic and the establishment of the communist party.""

They try to protect her from fans and prying questions.","Harper Lee's classic was published 50 years ago this summer and it remains the only novel she ever wrote. Lee, 84, has never explained why she stopped writing. She doesn't give interviews - ""Hell, no"" was her response to a request several decades ago - and that silence has only added to the intrigue. But her close friend Thomas Lane Butts, a retired minister in her hometown, Monroeville, Alabama, says she once told him the reason. Sitting on a pew in the Methodist church which the Lee family still attends, he described to me how she suddenly brought the subject up one night over dinner in New York. ""She asked me, 'You ever wonder why I didn't write anything else?' And I said, 'Along with several million other people, yes, I had wondered about that.' And she said, 'Well, what do you think?'"" Speaking in his slow southern drawl, the Rev Butts, who just turned 80, suggested to her that she had already written a great book and therefore didn't need to compete with herself. ""And when I got through she said, 'You're all wrong.' I said, 'Alright, smart Alec. You tell me.' She said, 'I would not go through all the deprivation of privacy through which I went for this book again for any amount of money.' ""And she said, 'I did not need to write another book. I said what I wanted to say in that book.'"" Harper Lee called it a simple tale about the ""conflict of the human soul"" and Monroeville, Alabama, is where she drew her inspiration. The story depicts the segregated South of her childhood, during the Depression. It was published at the height of the civil rights struggle. The Rev Butts grew up 10 miles outside Monroeville. By the late 1950s, he says, he was a ""fuzzy-cheeked young preacher"" campaigning for an end to segregation. He had met Martin Luther King Jr and signed a petition to boycott buses. The Ku Klux Klan had left a burning cross on his front lawn. He says To Kill a Mockingbird was not well received in Monroeville when it was published. ""The people who were hard racist did not like it because of the implication of the book,"" the Rev Butts told me. ""The book revealed racism and that always frightens a racist - when you pull the cover off them. ""Those of us who stood up for civil rights were much encouraged by the book because in a very skilful and subtle way it addressed itself for justice."" But these days, the Rev Butts says, there is enormous civic pride in Monroeville. The old courthouse, which Hollywood re-created for the film, now houses a museum to Harper Lee and the town's other literary icon, Truman Capote. Capote was a childhood friend of hers and is thought to be the inspiration for the Dill character in To Kill a Mockingbird. The town's residents often try to protect Lee, allowing her to live a normal life instead of being hounded by fans or bothered with prying questions. ""Being famous",1,4,3

She later sued the hospital for 1.7 million yuan ($260,900; Â£183,900) in","Though the unverified story was short on details, and did not have the husband's side of the story, ""divorced because of fat face"" quickly became a top trend on microblogging network Weibo. State media picked up the story on Thursday, which was first reported in a local evening paper earlier this week. Liaoshen Wanbao reported the 49-year-old woman in Shenyang city had claimed her husband had divorced her 10 years ago because he disliked the shape of her face, said to be ""large and square"" with ""fat cheeks"". She said it spurred her to undergo facial surgery three times at a local hospital to shave her jawbones and reshape her face into a slimmer shape. During the third surgery the doctors discovered that if they proceeded further her nerves may be damaged, and halted the procedure. The woman, identified only by her surname Wang, later sued the hospital for 1.7 million yuan ($260,900; Â£183,900) in damages. She alleged the surgery had left her with soreness in her chin, and she could only eat and drink through a straw as ""when she exerted force on her lower jaw, she had the sensation that it would break"". The hospital, however, argued that the surgeries were conducted according to regulations, and pointed out that they encouraged her to seek psychiatric help instead of a third operation, which she refused. After mediation the woman agreed to accept 20,000 yuan ($3,100, Â£2,200) as compensation, said the report. On Weibo, some condemned the woman's husband, but others also chastised the woman. One top-voted comment read: ""It's purely an excuse, if her face was large then why did he decide to marry her in the first place? If he stopped loving her then he should have just said so."" It continued: ""This woman is also very silly to have believed that her face shape was the real reason for the divorce, she is lying to herself."" Said another Weibo user: ""Even if you had gone for facial surgery and made your face smaller, he would still have found other reasons to divorce you."" One person noted the sharp difference in the compensation amount and voiced suspicions: ""1.7 million was dropped to 20,000, it makes me wonder if she really did have a problem with her jaw."" Still others took the opportunity to crack jokes. ""What an odd reason for divorce! I wonder how square was this woman's square-shaped face? Like a television set? Microwave oven?"" Plastic surgery has long been a hot topic on Weibo. In December, users similarly expressed outrage when a Chinese man took out a newspaper advertisement pleading for his wife to go for plastic surgery. More than seven million cosmetic surgeries were performed in China in 2014. The industry's value, pegged at around 400bn yuan, is expected to double by 2019, according to the China Association of Plastics and Aesthetics.",1,3,4
openai_text-curie-001 (0 shot),This article discusses how the Egyptian Revolution started on Facebook and how it has evolved since then.,"This revolution is the result of someone sending a Facebook invitation to many people. I got it like other people on our network. The buzz around it was then created on different social media websites and with videos. I was here on 25 January when riot police forced us out and by the 28th, we were back following the violence. I've been sleeping here most of the time since. Our social network was established in 2005, when there was a democratic opening around the time of the presidential elections. People from different backgrounds all met through blogging and hoped to use technology for social change. It meant we have all gained good contacts, experience and strong networks. I like to think the social network is the people itself. Things like Facebook, Twitter, SMS and phones are just social tools. When they blocked Facebook and shut down technology, our network still operated because it's about people. Internet activists are also people and a lot of our organising, social work and relationships are developed offline. This is something that people dreamt of but didn't anticipate happening in reality. If anything, it shows that all the effort we put in over the past few years has not been wasted. It has climaxed into this critical mass of people you see in the square. At the moment I'm not getting a lot of internet connection. I'm trying not to drain my phone battery. We're still using it to distribute footage people are bringing to us that we've sorted through. I hope the internet will continue to play a complementary role in activism. At the moment we physically exist in downtown Cairo and I hope that when we have finished this sit-in, we will have won the right to organise ourselves outside the internet. Twitter: Amr Gharbeia I was involved in this revolution from the first day, 25 January, and I've now been spending my nights here for a while. For the past five years, I was very active online, blogging and tweeting. As we live under emergency laws in Egypt it has been very difficult to meet or communicate except on the internet. I'd never been part of a demonstration on the ground. At first we were mocking the event on 25 January. We questioned whether it was really possible to have a ""Facebook revolution"". I came on the 25th because I felt it was my duty as a citizen and I couldn't believe how it turned into something so different from what we've seen before. I was walking among the people and weeping. Now I sometimes just tweet to update people about what's going on or to call for a million-man demonstration or a day to remember our martyrs. I'm well-known among bloggers for my long articles and constant tweets, but once I was here I stopped communicating this way so much. I felt it was totally different to have real freedom rather than just hypothetical freedom or internet freedom. Blogging and tweeting has been important as we were building our minds.

But despite the church's best efforts the bats are not moving and are soiling the altar and church furniture, leaving the church with an ""appalling smell"". The creatures are protected by law and cannot be wilfully disturbed. Volunteers at the church have been working for the past decade to keep the altar, stonework and woodwork clean. But the bats, roosting in the higher areas of the church continually soil the interior of the building with urine and faeces. Church warden Liz Cowley said keeping the 11th Century building in good shape was difficult. She said: ""You can see the urine marks (on the altar), they won't go away. ""If people were coming in here damaging an ancient building like this, you would say it was criminal damage. ""The smell is appalling, it's a combination of ammonia from the urine and a musty smell from the droppings that catches at the back of the throat.""

The Rev Paul Mothersdale, the Rector of St Hilda's Church, said a lot of money had been invested in trying to persuade the bats to move out of the church. The Rev Mothersdale said: ""We've tried to do everything that English Nature, or Natural England, have wanted us to do.

He admitted culpable homicide on the basis of diminished responsibility after saying he had no recollection of the killing at Dixon Avenue, Glasgow, on 24 September last year. Buksh will be sentenced on 27 June. The High Court in Glasgow heard that 43-year-old Mrs Buksh died after being struck on the head at least five times. Pathologists told the court that the lack of defensive injuries and the position of her body suggested she was assaulted as she slept. Following the attack, Buksh went to Cathcart Police Station and told an officer: ""I've come to hand myself in. I think my wife's dead. I hit her on the head. I did it."" The court was told that three psychiatrists described Buksh as suffering from an acute stress disorder at the time. Prosecutor Gordon Lamont said: ""The accused and his wife had been married for 25 years, but over the last 10 or 11 years their relationship appears to have broken down and they became increasingly estranged, albeit, still residing under the one roof. ""They slept separately and Mrs Buksh routinely slept on the sofa in the living room. Their children report that they barely spoke to each other."" Mr Lamont said the problems in the marriage intensified after Mrs Buksh went to Pakistan on holiday in May last year. He said she had become involved with another man and was making plans to move to Pakistan. The court also heard that two days before he killed his wife, Buksh went to Paisley Police Office and spoke with a support officer saying he feared his wife was going to take their youngest child, aged 10, to Pakistan and not return. He also made an emergency doctor's appointment and said he was suffering from stress and not sleeping. He was prescribed medication for stress.

""This is not a case where this man was a bad husband, there was no domestic abuse. This was an unhappy marriage, but however, unhappy it was it didn't justify killing his wife.

Internet companies will also be required to allow Russian authorities access to users' information. One human rights group called the move ""draconian"". The law was approved by Russia's upper house of parliament in April. It includes measures to ensure that bloggers cannot remain anonymous, and states that social networks must maintain six months of data on its users. The information must be stored on servers based in Russian territory, so that government authorities can gain access. Critics see it as the latest in a series of recent moves to curb internet freedom. Hugh Williamson, of New York-based Human Rights Watch, has called the law ""another milestone in Russia's relentless crackdown on free expression"". ""The internet is the last island of free expression in Russia and these draconian regulations are clearly aimed at putting it under government control,"" he added.

Some already share advice on how to use proxy servers in order to access social media sites that, in their view, are under threat of being closed. It is hard to see how the law will be enforced. The servers for most of the popular social media platforms that many Russians use are based outside Russia. Many popular bloggers are already looking for, and apparently finding, ways to ""cheat"" the feature that counts page visits and keep their daily unique visitor numbers just under 3000, or to make sure that the statistics are hidden altogether. Anton Nossik, who is considered Russia's ""internet guru"", wrote in his LiveJournal blog that the new law didn't threaten individual bloggers directly, but provided legal grounds to block popular social networks like Facebook, Twitter, LiveJournal and Google. ""The issue of banning all these platforms in Russia is a political one and it will be decided by only one person"", Mr Nossik wrote, with a thinly veiled reference to President Vladimir Putin. Earlier in the year, Russia enacted a law that gave the government powers to block websites without explanation. In March, Moscow blocked the blog of Mr Navalny, along with two news sites and a organisation run by Garry Kasparov - a vocal critic of the Russian government. In a statement, Russia's prosecutor general's office said the blocks were imposed because of the sites' role in helping stage illegal protests.

Fracking is subject to a temporary ban in Wales until decision-making powers on the practice are devolved. Natural Resources Wales said it had carried out a ""thorough assessment"" of the company's plans before approving them, with all work including reinstatement of the land to be completed within 12 months. ""It's important that any activity of this kind doesn't harm the environment, and this permit makes it clear what Coastal Oil and Gas Limited will need to do to comply with this,"" a spokesman said. ""Once the work begins, our officers will regulate and monitor the site to ensure it complies with the conditions of the permit, to protect people and the environment."" The permit for exploratory drilling comes despite a moratorium on fracking in Wales pending devolution of responsibility for such decisions. In August, the UK government urged councils in England to speed up the process of approval for fracking projects. However, Natural Resources Minister Carl Sargeant said fracking technology was ""unproven"", and that Welsh Labour ministers preferred to look at renewable energy.",1,5,5

It also says they should not ratify a similar deal that has already been done between the EU and Canada. It says some aspects pose a threat to democracy and the rule of law. One of the concerns mentioned in the petition is the idea of tribunals that foreign investors would be able to use in some circumstances to sue governments. There is a great deal of controversy over exactly what this system, known as Investor State Dispute Settlement, would enable companies to do, but campaigners see it as an opportunity for international business to get compensation for government policy changes that adversely affect them. This kind of provision exists in many bilateral trade and investment agreements. Friends of the Earth have published new research on the impact they have had on EU countries. Information about these cases is not always made public, but the group says that going back to 1994, foreign investors have sought compensation of almost €30bn (£24bn) from 20 states. Where the results are known (a small minority of the total), the tribunals have awarded total compensation of €3.5bn (about £2.8bn). In Britain, the possible implications of this provision for the National Health Service have been especially controversial. Campaigners believe that the investor tribunals would make it harder to reverse any decisions to contract services out to international healthcare firms. John Hilary of War on Want said: TTIP ""will make it impossible for any future government to repeal the Health & Social Care Act and bring the NHS back into public hands"". The petition lists a number of other areas where its signatories believes European standards would suffer if the TTIP negotiations are completed and the Canada deal is ratified: employment, social, environmental, privacy and consumer protection. The European Commission says the EU will not have to sacrifice its high standards. It also says investor protection provisions are important for investment flows and have in general worked well. But it accepts there is a need for improvement and is trying to achieve that in its bilateral negotiations. The petition has been organised as an exercise called a European Citizens' Initiative which can lead to a public hearing in the European Parliament and require the European Commission to give a formal response explaining why it is accepting or rejecting what the petitioners call for. The European Commission has already said that the petition doesn't qualify as such an Initiative. Campaigners have launched a legal challenge to this decision.",0,5,3

State media picked up the story on Thursday, which was first reported in a local evening paper earlier this week. Liaoshen Wanbao reported the 49-year-old woman in Shenyang city had claimed her husband had divorced her 10 years ago because he disliked the shape of her face, said to be ""large and square"" with ""fat cheeks"". She said it spurred her to undergo facial surgery three times at a local hospital to shave her jawbones and reshape her face into a slimmer shape. During the third surgery the doctors discovered that if they proceeded further her nerves may be damaged, and halted the procedure. The woman, identified only by her surname Wang, later sued the hospital for 1.7 million yuan ($260,900; Â£183,900) in damages. She alleged the surgery had left her with soreness in her chin, and she could only eat and drink through a straw as ""when she exerted force on her lower jaw, she had the sensation that it would break"". The hospital, however, argued that the surgeries were conducted according to regulations, and pointed out that they encouraged her to seek psychiatric help instead of a third operation, which she refused. After mediation the woman agreed to accept 20,000 yuan ($3,100, Â£2,200) as compensation, said the report. On Weibo, some condemned the woman's husband, but others also chastised the woman. One top-voted comment read: ""It's purely an excuse, if her face was large then why did he decide to marry her in the first place? If he stopped loving her then he should have just said so."" It continued: ""This woman is also very silly to have believed that her face shape was the real reason for the divorce, she is lying to herself."" Said another Weibo user: ""Even if you had gone for facial surgery and made your face smaller, he would still have found other reasons to divorce you."" One person noted the sharp difference in the compensation amount and voiced suspicions: ""1.7 million was dropped to 20,000, it makes me wonder if she really did have a problem with her jaw."" Still others took the opportunity to crack jokes. ""What an odd reason for divorce! I wonder how square was this woman's square-shaped face? Like a television set? Microwave oven?"" Plastic surgery has long been a hot topic on Weibo. In December, users similarly expressed outrage when a Chinese man took out a newspaper advertisement pleading for his wife to go for plastic surgery. More than seven million cosmetic surgeries were performed in China in 2014. The industry's value, pegged at around 400bn yuan, is expected to double by 2019, according to the China Association of Plastics and Aesthetics.",0,5,4

The murder, filmed on CCTV and on mobile phones, sparked outrage. The Church of the Almighty God cult is banned in China but claims to have millions of members. Following the brutal killing in May, Chinese authorities said that they detained hundreds of members of the cult, reports the BBC's Martin Patience in Beijing. Interviewed in prison later, one of the defendants, Zhang Lidong showed no remorse. He said: ""I beat her with all my might and stamped on her too. She was a demon. We had to destroy her."" The group had entered a small McDonalds branch in Zhaoyuan in Shandong province last May soliciting phone numbers and hoping to recruit members to their cult. Ms Wu was waiting in the restaurant with her seven-year-old son and when she refused to give her number, an act which prompted the beating while they screamed at other diners to keep away or they would face the same fate. The public face of the Church of the Almighty God is a website full of uplifting hymns and homilies. But its core belief is that God has returned to earth as a Chinese woman to wreak the apocalypse. The only person who claims direct contact with this god is a former physics teacher, Zhao Weishan, who founded the cult 25 years ago and has since fled to the United States, says BBC China Editor Carrie Gracie. No-one knows exactly where he is, but much of the website's message of outright hostility to the Chinese government is delivered in English as well as Chinese. The cult complains that religious faith has suffered from persecution by the Communist Party.

Also, India's colonial-era sedition law has been often used against students, journalists, writers and social activists and those critical of the government.

Senior police official Sateesh Bino told the NDTV news channel that the writer-activist ""is being questioned for his controversial post on the national anthem on Facebook"" and had been charged with sedition. Earlier this month, 12 people were arrested at a cinema in Kerala, after they remained seated while the national anthem played. The cinemagoers, who were attending an international film festival, were later freed but they face charges of ""failure to obey an order issued by a public servant, thereby causing obstruction or annoyance to others"".

Freezing care provider fees to save money was no long sustainable, it said. Ministers say extra money will help NHS and social care services work together. The survey, which was completed by 147 directors of adult social services for councils in England, suggests that funding reductions to social care budgets have totalled £4.6bn since 2010 - a 31% overall reduction. Budgets for adult social care - which provides practical support to people due to illness, disability, old age or a low income - will reduce by a further £500m in cash terms this year, it said. ""Taking the growth in numbers of older and disabled people into account, this means that an additional £1.1bn would be needed to provide the same level of service as last year,"" the report warned. It said some councils had made savings in the past by freezing fees paid to providers, but care providers were now also facing financial problems. Some companies - particularly those in southern England - are struggling to attract staff, amid increasing concern about the quality of care, it said. ""What is at stake is the continuing capacity of adult social care to sustain services to those in greatest need,"" ADASS president Ray James said. ""In virtually all our authorities, the number in need is growing, while the complexity of their needs is increasing."" ADASS called for the government to ""protect essential care and support services to the most vulnerable members of our community"". But a government spokesman said the survey ""ignores"" a commitment to invest £10bn in health services that are being ""joined up"" with social care, by 2020. The BBC has launched an online guide to the care system for the over-65s. The ""care calculator"" covers residential care and the support provided in people's own homes, for tasks such as washing and dressing. Users can submit their postcode and find out how much each service costs where they live in the UK. There is also a dedicated BBC Cost of Care website, with news stories, analysis and video. The spokesman said: ""Increasing budgets isn't the only solution. By working innovatively and joining up health and social care we can improve care and also save money.""

Ofsted criticised the trust's lack of support to the schools and said each was now considering an alternative sponsor. Inspectors said pupils' achievement at the Phoenix Academy had dropped since it became an academy in 2013 and their latest report rated it inadequate in all areas. A report in 2013, before it converted, rated the secondary school as ""requiring improvement"", while Lakeside was rated ""good"" in 2012 under its former name the Lord Silkin School. In the latest report, inspectors said the curriculum at Phoenix Academy was ""inadequate"", while ""weak teaching"" meant pupils were not sufficiently challenged and were often ""disengaged and disruptive"". There was particular criticism of standards in English and maths which the watchdog said were limiting pupils' achievements in other areas. Ofsted's report said governors, managers and teachers had developed a ""culture of low expectations"", while leaders had failed to act decisively to halt the decline in pupils' achievement. There was, however, some praise for the acting head teacher. Inspectors said he had introduced a number of improvement measures and some were ""beginning to have an impact"". A report on Lakeside School highlighted similar concerns, criticising teachers for not sufficiently challenging pupils and for having ""over generous"" predictions of their achievement. Inspectors said many pupils, whether high achievers or those with special educational needs, were ""not making the progress they should"" and achievements at GCSE were well below the national average.

I got it like other people on our network. The buzz around it was then created on different social media websites and with videos. I was here on 25 January when riot police forced us out and by the 28th, we were back following the violence. I've been sleeping here most of the time since. Our social network was established in 2005, when there was a democratic opening around the time of the presidential elections. People from different backgrounds all met through blogging and hoped to use technology for social change. It meant we have all gained good contacts, experience and strong networks. I like to think the social network is the people itself. Things like Facebook, Twitter, SMS and phones are just social tools. When they blocked Facebook and shut down technology, our network still operated because it's about people. Internet activists are also people and a lot of our organising, social work and relationships are developed offline. This is something that people dreamt of but didn't anticipate happening in reality. If anything, it shows that all the effort we put in over the past few years has not been wasted. It has climaxed into this critical mass of people you see in the square. At the moment I'm not getting a lot of internet connection. I'm trying not to drain my phone battery. We're still using it to distribute footage people are bringing to us that we've sorted through. I hope the internet will continue to play a complementary role in activism.

For the past five years, I was very active online, blogging and tweeting. As we live under emergency laws in Egypt it has been very difficult to meet or communicate except on the internet. I'd never been part of a demonstration on the ground. At first we were mocking the event on 25 January. We questioned whether it was really possible to have a ""Facebook revolution"". I came on the 25th because I felt it was my duty as a citizen and I couldn't believe how it turned into something so different from what we've seen before. I was walking among the people and weeping. Now I sometimes just tweet to update people about what's going on or to call for a million-man demonstration or a day to remember our martyrs. I'm well-known among bloggers for my long articles and constant tweets, but once I was here I stopped communicating this way so much.

""But our only chance to find out about the earliest chapter of Britain's history could be wrecked if the tunnel goes ahead."" Andy Rhind-Tutt, a former mayor and current chairman of Amesbury Museum, which part-funded the dig, said the discovery could ""provide what archaeologists have been searching for centuries - the answer to the story of the pre-history of Stonehenge."" Earlier this month, the government announced funding for a 1.8-mile (2.9km) tunnel to remove congestion from the main road past Stonehenge. A Department for Transport spokesman said: ""As with any road scheme, we will consult with interested parties before any building begins on the A303. ""English Heritage and National Trust are supportive of our plans, and we will ensure sites of cultural or historical significance are safeguarded as we progress with the upgrade.""",0,5,4
openai_text-davinci-002,"Archaeologists have found evidence of a Mesolithic Period shelter at Blick Mead, near Stonehenge, which was used for 90 years.","The shelter - in a hollow left behind by a fallen tree - at Blick Mead was used over a 90-year period from 4336 BC, it is believed. Archaeologist David Jacques, said: ""They... used the stump of the tree, about three metres high, as a wall."" The finds are being shown to United Nations heritage experts, who are currently visiting Stonehenge. Archaeologists are concerned a planned 2.9km tunnel being considered for the nearby A303 main road will damage the site. Discoveries have also shown stones were warmed up by the Mesolithic Period inhabitants and used in a hearth to emit heat in the earthy snug. Mr Jacques, a senior research fellow at the University of Buckingham, has worked at Blick Mead for over a decade, making a number of discoveries about the inhabitants. The tree stump created a wall height similar to a ""modern bungalow"". ""They've draped probably animal skins or thatch around the basin and connected it to a post so it's a very comfortable snug little place,"" he said. The wooden wall of the hollow was lined with flints and the large earthy pit created by the tree root lined with cobbles and decorated with ""exotic"" stones from outside the area. ""There are some clever and sophisticated things going on, the hot stones that they put into this little type of alcove wouldn't have been on fire,"" explained Mr Jacques. ""It looks more like these people have been using these hot stones as a type of storage heater so that you've got a lot of warmth coming off them."" Mr Jacques will meet the UN experts later to ask for the route to be moved closer to Salisbury and for hydrological assessments to be made. ""It's very likely the water flow would be reduced in and around the site,"" he said. ""It would take out all the organics and destroy all the animal bone we've been finding which is crucial for finding where they have been living and for getting radiocarbon dates from all the organics like pollen and wood. ""This is massively important for reconstructing what the landscape would have looked like."" Andy Rhind-Tutt, former mayor and chairman of Amesbury Museum and Heritage Trust said: ""I sincerely hope the team delivering the long-awaited A303 improvement look seriously at an alternative alignment south of Salisbury and away from this unequalled archaeological landscape. ""It would be criminal to destroy such a rich heritage and connection with our ancestors for the sake of blocking the view to the passing public of Stonehenge.""",1,4,4

The city was rocked by riots in April when a black man died after suffering injuries in police custody. Six officers were charged over the death of the 25-year-old, Freddie Gray. Speaking at a news conference on Wednesday, Mayor Rawlings-Blake said Mr Batts had ""served this city with distinction"" since becoming police chief in October 2012. But referring to the city's high homicide rate, she said ""too many continue to die"". ""The focus has been too much on the leadership of the department and not enough on the crime fighting,"" she told reporters, adding: ""We need to get the crime surge under control."" The city has seen a sharp increase in violence since Freddie Gray's death on 19 April, with 155 homicides this year, a 48% increase over the same period last year. On Tuesday, the police department announced that an outside organisation will review its response to the civil unrest that followed Mr Gray's death. The US justice department is also conducting a civil rights review of the Baltimore force and Mr Batts has been criticised by the city's police union. Earlier on Wednesday, the union released its report into the police handling of the rioting. It said officers had complained ""that they lacked basic riot equipment, training, and, as events unfolded, direction from leadership"". The report also said ""officers repeatedly expressed concern that the passive response to the civil unrest had allowed the disorder to grow into full scale rioting"". Recent events had ""placed attention on police leadership"", Ms Rawlings-Blake said, but denied her decision was influenced by the union report. Mr Davis, who is taking over immediately as interim police chief, praised his ""friend"" Mr Batts and said he was a ""true reform commissioner"". Mayor Rawlings-Blake said Mr Davis would ""bring accountability to police, hold officers who act out of line accountable for their actions"".",1,5,5

His intervention in the debate - made, as he termed it, with ""deafening eclat"" - was even said to have helped cause the pound to slide on the international money markets as traders thought it made the possibility of a so-called Brexit more likely. He has arguably the highest profile of any of the governing Conservative Party except the Prime Minister David Cameron, but those outside the UK may be wondering: who is he, and is that actually his hair? Read on. Profile: Boris Johnson How could 'zip wire prat' become prime minister? Read more about the UK's referendum on the EU Alexander Boris de Pfeffel Johnson, to give him his full name, was born in New York and is descended from Turkish, French and German stock. He describes himself as a ""one-man melting pot"". He first made a name for himself in journalism, including a stint as Brussels correspondent for the right-wing Daily Telegraph newspaper and editor of The Spectator magazine. His humorous persona led him to become a fixture on various television programmes, including the satirical BBC panel show Have I Got News For You. He still has a lucrative and entertaining column in the Daily Telegraph, in which august forum he explained the reasons for his decision on the EU. As a politician, he has been a Conservative member of parliament for two constituencies, Henley from 2001 to 2008 and then Uxbridge and South Ruislip from 2015. Lest you think he was putting his feet up between parliamentary mandates, he is also currently serving the second of two terms as mayor of London, no mean feat in a city where the centre-left Labour Party has dominated in recent decades. That's indicative of the position Mr Johnson has carved out for himself as one of the most charismatic politicians in the UK who has wide appeal beyond Conservative heartlands - polling has suggested that his stance on the EU referendum may sway some undecided voters. Just look what happens when you type his name into Google.co.uk. Not quite. He has previously courted controversy for his remarks about (among others) the populations of Liverpool, Portsmouth and Papua New Guinea, not to mention run-ins with his own party leadership and TV chef Jamie Oliver. Last October he accidentally flattened a 10-year-old schoolboy at what was meant to be a friendly game of photo-op rugby in Japan. But none of this seems to have affected his standing among the party faithful or the public at large. Even getting stuck on a zip-wire during the London Olympics in 2012, a sure-fire route to derision for any other politician, only enhanced his eccentric image. Mr Johnson finally ended months of speculation about which side of the EU debate he would back in an immaculately impromptu media scrum outside his home in North London, having reportedly informed the prime minister of his decision earlier the same day.

Needing 99 to win, England sent out Jos Buttler and Ben Stokes in the top four. But they were eventually beaten by the fading light, finishing 25 runs short of a famous victory on 74-4. The tourists could not find the boundary frequently enough before the umpires brought the teams off, with Joe Root 33 not out. However, this was a hugely impressive performance from England and one that will fill them with confidence ahead of the second Test in Dubai, which begins on Thursday. After England concluded their innings on 598-9 in the morning, Pakistan looked assured at 113-3 shortly after tea, leading by 38 with seven second-innings wickets remaining. But the match turned when veteran batsman Younus Khan, playing in his 102nd Test match, mistimed a wild heave to give Rashid his first Test wicket - caught at point by Stokes. Rashid - whose figures in the first innings were the worst ever by a debutant - then quickly added a second victim, having Asad Shafiq caught behind for six. The door was opened for England, and Rashid and Moeen Ali barged through it as they polished off the last five wickets for 14 runs. Pakistan skipper Misbah ul-Haq - who had played with restraint for his 51 - inexplicably aimed an uncharacteristic slog at Moeen and was bowled. Moeen then removed Wahab Riaz caught behind, before Rashid claimed the final three wickets - all superbly caught at first slip by James Anderson. England sensed an unlikely victory, but their reorganised batting order could not score quickly enough as Pakistan's tactic of spin from both ends and fielders on the boundary brought them regular wickets. Makeshift opener Buttler was trapped lbw for four, Moeen and Stokes were caught on the boundary in quick succession, and Jonny Bairstow was stumped attempting a big shot. However, in truth it was mistakes earlier in the match that ultimately proved more costly as England fell just short of their first win on the subcontinent since beating India in Kolkata in 2012. In Pakistan's first innings, Ian Bell dropped Mohammad Hafeez (98) and Shafiq (107) at slip early in their innings. And Shoaib Malik, who made 245, was dismissed off a no-ball by Stuart Broad. England captain Alastair Cook, whose record-breaking 263 in the first innings was ultimately in vain, admitted England were frustrated to come so close to victory. ""We'd have liked another three or four overs at the end but that's the way it goes,"" he said. ""I can't fault the guys for hanging in there on that wicket.

Appointments affected include scans and consultations with specialists - including those for cancer patients. The British Medical Association said such incentives were ""misguided"". At least nine clinical commissioning groups (CCGs) were offering GP practices payments for hitting targets, according to Pulse's investigation. In one case, Birmingham South Central CCG was offering practices more than Â£11,000 to reduce new outpatient attendances, follow-ups, A&E attendances and emergency admissions by 1%, compared with 2014/15. It said the schemes, which exclude cancer referrals, were designed to ""incentivise best quality practice"" and ""drive improvements in the quality of primary medical care"". ""Our priority is to ensure that patients have access to services that they need, when they need them,"" said a spokesperson for Birmingham South Central CCG. Another CCG told Pulse it had considered the ""full impact"" of the incentive scheme and was ""confident that there is no conflict of interest"". Pulse said that one scheme had already been looked at by the General Medical Council, the body which regulates medical standards in the UK, after local GP leaders expressed their concern. The magazine pointed out that initial hospital referrals for cancer patients should happen within two weeks of a GP first suspecting the condition. Dr Chand Nagpaul, chairman of the GPs committee of the doctors' trade union the British Medical Association, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that such schemes were a ""financial contaminant"" to patient-doctor trust. He said: ""It's short-sighted and misguided of CCGs to introduce such mechanisms, because they do lead to the potential for patients questioning the motives of GP referrals. ""We believe it is far more appropriate for CCGs to introduce clinical pathways that ensure patients are referred appropriately rather than these crude, salesman-like bonuses which pay GPs simply to make reduction to referrals in numerical terms."" Dr Peter Melton is local GP and clinical chief officer for North East Lincolnshire CCG, which offers the equivalent of more than Â£6,000 to practices that reduce outpatient referrals to the same level as the 25% with the lowest referral rates (which include two-week urgent cancer referrals) in 2014/15. He said the CCG was already among the best in England for referring suspected cancer patients to a consultant within two weeks and the scheme was not about avoiding sending people to hospital. ""It is not focussing on referral reduction per se but on better clinical and quality standards for the patient,"" he explained.

Lee, 84, has never explained why she stopped writing. She doesn't give interviews - ""Hell, no"" was her response to a request several decades ago - and that silence has only added to the intrigue. But her close friend Thomas Lane Butts, a retired minister in her hometown, Monroeville, Alabama, says she once told him the reason. Sitting on a pew in the Methodist church which the Lee family still attends, he described to me how she suddenly brought the subject up one night over dinner in New York. ""She asked me, 'You ever wonder why I didn't write anything else?' And I said, 'Along with several million other people, yes, I had wondered about that.' And she said, 'Well, what do you think?'"" Speaking in his slow southern drawl, the Rev Butts, who just turned 80, suggested to her that she had already written a great book and therefore didn't need to compete with herself. ""And when I got through she said, 'You're all wrong.' I said, 'Alright, smart Alec. You tell me.' She said, 'I would not go through all the deprivation of privacy through which I went for this book again for any amount of money.' ""And she said, 'I did not need to write another book. I said what I wanted to say in that book.'"" Harper Lee called it a simple tale about the ""conflict of the human soul"" and Monroeville, Alabama, is where she drew her inspiration. The story depicts the segregated South of her childhood, during the Depression. It was published at the height of the civil rights struggle. The Rev Butts grew up 10 miles outside Monroeville. By the late 1950s, he says, he was a ""fuzzy-cheeked young preacher"" campaigning for an end to segregation. He had met Martin Luther King Jr and signed a petition to boycott buses. The Ku Klux Klan had left a burning cross on his front lawn. He says To Kill a Mockingbird was not well received in Monroeville when it was published. ""The people who were hard racist did not like it because of the implication of the book,"" the Rev Butts told me. ""The book revealed racism and that always frightens a racist - when you pull the cover off them. ""Those of us who stood up for civil rights were much encouraged by the book because in a very skilful and subtle way it addressed itself for justice."" But these days, the Rev Butts says, there is enormous civic pride in Monroeville. The old courthouse, which Hollywood re-created for the film, now houses a museum to Harper Lee and the town's other literary icon, Truman Capote. Capote was a childhood friend of hers and is thought to be the inspiration for the Dill character in To Kill a Mockingbird.

openai_text-davinci-002,"In an interview with the Atlantic, Obama says Cameron became ""distracted"" during the Libya intervention and that the country is now ""a mess"".","Speaking to the Atlantic magazine, he said the operation went as well as he had hoped, but Libya was now ""a mess"". The article also said he had warned the PM the UK would have to pay its ""fair share"" and spend 2% of GDP on defence. In response, Number 10 said there were ""many difficult challenges"" in Libya, while the White House said it deeply valued the UK's contributions. Downing Street did not comment on President Obama's remark to the PM about defence spending, reportedly made before Chancellor George Osborne said the government would fulfil a Nato pledge to spend 2% of national income on defence last year. In response to the interview, a spokesman for the US National Security Council said Mr Cameron had been ""as close a partner as the president has had"" adding that ""we deeply value the UK's contributions on our shared national security and foreign policy objectives"". BBC North America editor Jon Sopel said the unsolicited statement put out by the White House suggested Downing Street had reacted angrily to the article. ""It's like we've seen a curtain drawn back on the unspun thoughts of President Obama, complete with frustration as well, and what we've seen tonight is the White House trying to close the curtain as quickly as it can,"" he added. The toppling of the Gaddafi regime in Libya - following UN-backed air strikes designed to protect civilians - led to a power vacuum and instability, with no authority in full control. The intervention was led by the UK and France - and in his interview, Mr Obama reflects on ""what went wrong"", saying: ""There's room for criticism, because I had more faith in the Europeans, given Libya's proximity, being invested in the follow-up."" Mr Cameron, he said, became ""distracted by a range of other things"". He also criticised former French President Nicolas Sarkozy, saying he had tried to claim the spotlight. The former French president, he said, ""wanted to trumpet the flights he was taking in the air campaign, despite the fact that we had wiped out all the air defences and essentially set up the entire infrastructure"" for the intervention. President Obama said the intervention ""averted large-scale civilian casualties (and) prevented what almost surely would have been a prolonged and bloody civil conflict"". But he added: ""And despite all that, Libya is a mess."" He also criticised what he called ""free riders"" in the interview, saying European and Gulf countries were calling for action against Gaddafi, adding: ""But what has been a habit over the last several decades in these circumstances is people pushing us to act but then showing an unwillingness to put any skin in the game."" Despite efforts to support Libya's National Transitional Council, and the first elections in the country for decades, it rapidly descended into violence, with two rival governments and the formation of hundreds of militias, some allied to so-called Islamic State. In January, Mr Cameron told MPs the ""Libyan people were given the opportunity"" to build a stable democracy - and it was a matter",1,5,4

That is down from 6.1% in the previous quarter. Analysts were expecting the same figure for January to March. India is the third-largest economy in Asia but has been struggling with inflation and currency weakness. Since July last year, the Indian rupee has seen one of the biggest declines among Asian currencies, dropping more than 27% against the US dollar. ""Shocking numbers as growth was even lower than lows witnessed during the financial crisis,"" said Anubhuti Sahay from Standard Chartered Bank in Mumbai. The BBC's Yogita Limaye in Mumbai said that just a year ago India was aspiring for double-digit growth. But a global slowdown has reduced external demand, and high inflation coupled with a weak rupee has made things more expensive within the country. Domestic demand, which India's economy is largely reliant on, has also slowed in part due to the political upheaval in the country. India's economy is suffering from ""policy incoherence, shifting global risk appetite and a comatose government"", said Rajeev Malik, senior economist at brokerage CLSA India's Prime Minister Manmohan Singh admitted early this month that his government must do more to get the once fast-growing economy moving again. The Congress-led coalition government is caught up in a slew of corruption scandals. Key policy reforms, including allowing foreign investment in India's retail sector, have been delayed in parliament for more than a year. This has worried foreign investors and threatened the country's investment grade credit rating. ""This is definitely a very important signal for the government - this is a make or break situation for India and the government has to step on the panic button,"" said Rupa Rege Nitsure, chief economist at Bank of Baroda in Mumbai. ""If the government doesn't step in now, India's sovereign ratings may be jeopardised.""",1,4,4
openai_text-davinci-002,"Inverness CT's hopes of avoiding relegation took a major blow as they lost at home to St Johnstone, with two players sent off.","Steven Maclean bundled home the opener five minutes before half-time. The hosts, slacker after the break, had beleaguered striker Larnell Cole sent-off after he confronted the referee. Liam Craig sealed the win from the penalty spot with two minutes to play, before Graham Cummins finished a sumptuous stoppage-time move. And things got worse still for Caley Thistle after the match, with captain Gary Warren shown a red card in the tunnel. Saints remain five points clear of Hearts in fourth place, and closed the gap on third-placed Rangers, who play Aberdeen on Sunday, to three points. With game after game ticking past, Inverness' position looks increasingly perilous. Next weekend's trip to Motherwell, second-bottom on goal difference, is now seismic. This contest turned nightmarish for the hosts after a bright opening, but the truth is, given their predicament, Caley Thistle did not threaten St Johnstone's goal enough. Billy Mckay sent a shot over from close range. Alex Fisher nodded a diving header wide. Carl Tremarco miscued a volley. Greg Tansey did draw a save from Alan Mannus when he rasped in an effort from outside the box, but Richie Foran's side never looked likely to find the net. Their best opportunity came immediately after the Saints went ahead, when Tansey fed Cole, who seemed to panic in a terrific position and shot straight at Mannus. Cole's dismissal ended the contest when he appeared to be cautioned twice for challenging referee Stephen Finnie's decision not to award a foul. St Johnstone were merciless and could have had more. With just one win from their last 21 league games, Inverness look deep in trouble. Tommy Wright's side deserve so much credit. Saints were tactically brilliant, so strong defensively and ruthlessly capitalised on their man advantage. They took one of their few first-half chances when Michael Coulson broke down the left and sent a dangerous ball across the six-yard box. Owain Fon Williams could only parry into the danger area, Cummins' shot was blocked but Maclean followed up to force it home. They should have had another when Craig's superb curling corner flew all the way to the back post where Cummins slid in and somehow knocked it over from two yards. Craig, in his 300th appearance for the club, coolly converted a spot-kick after Cummins was tripped to seal the points. Cummins then slammed home after Miller danced around the area to tee him up, before Craig cracked the bar amid the late flurry. With a tendency to finish the season strongly, and just a three-point gap to Rangers, the Perth side look capable of something special this term. Inverness CT manager Richie Foran: ""It is a tough time of the season to be sitting bottom, and I need real men to stand up to that, but not enough of them did that today. ""It is pure luck we are still in it and it is only four points. I sound like a broken record but one win changes it - that is the truth. But I need braver players with more passion and desire.",0,4,4

""We were [rehearsing] in the tent for about a week and a half, then we had to move to bigger studios in Hollywood where we are working on the rest of the show,"" she told Houston radio station Mix 96.5. ""And then we will send that equipment to Houston where we will finish rehearsals. Fans can expect a performance that spans my career so far."" She has a high standard to live up to - notably Prince's show in 2007, which took place in the middle of a Miami thunderstorm and is widely accepted as the greatest performance in the event's history, if not Prince's career. Here are some of the other most memorable - and surprising - moments from the last 30 years. Super Bowl performers get a very strict 12-minute time limit, so most performers cram their set with as much music as possible. Not Michael Jackson. After shooting onto the stage at the Pasadena Rose Bowl, he stood completely still, staring at the world for a full 90 seconds. Ninety. It was a master class in ratcheting expectation to a fever pitch. And the screams when he launched into Jam (not one of his best songs) proved he knew what he was doing. Brilliantly, Jackson staged this entire performance while wearing a jacket it looked like he'd borrowed from Muammar Gaddafi. Beat that, Gaga. Baby, he was born to run... and slide on his knees... and crotch slam a TV camera. In his autobiography, The Boss explains the incident like this: ""Too much adrenalin, a late drop, too much speed, here I come, Mikeâ€¦ BOOM! ""And I'm onto his camera, the lens implanted into my chest with one leg off the stage. I use his camera to push myself back up andâ€¦ BLAM! BORN TO RUN!"" It led to the memorable headline: ""America Attacked by Bruce Springsteen's crotch"" - but it didn't stop the star delivering one of the most powerful and energetic Super Bowl shows in recent history. Even if they were fined for over-running by 40 seconds. Coldplay were the headline act at last year's Super Bowl in Santa Clara - but someone forgot to tell Beyonce. She only performed one song, Formation, underscoring its message of black pride and power with back-up dancers dressed in leather body suits and black berets reminiscent of the Black Panthers movement. Some of her dancers were even pictured holding up a sign declaring ""Justice 4 Mario Woods"" - a 26-year-old black man who was shot dead by armed police in San Francisco two months earlier. The performance heralded the arrival of her unapologetically political album, Lemonade, later in the year.

Marussia said surgeons at Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge ""embarked on a lengthy procedure to address the serious head and facial injuries sustained by Maria in the accident"".

openai_text-davinci-002,"Mead, an alcoholic drink made from honey, is experiencing a resurgence in popularity in the United States.","But what's brewing in this new crop of commercial meaderies - as they are known - is lot more refined from the drink that once decorated tables across medieval Europe. ""Do we have any mead makers or home brewers in the group?"" asks Ben Alexander, eying a crowd of a dozen or so people who have come to his Maine Meade Works, in Portland, on a rainy Friday for a tour. When no-one raises their hand, Mr Alexander launches into the full spiel. ""If you guys want to come around, I'll show you how this thing works,"" he says, gesturing to two ceiling-high columns of stainless steel filled with something resembling a mushy golden porridge. ""We mix up honey and water over there and we pump it through a hot water bath at 160 degrees [71C] in a stainless steel coil here. Each one produces about 50 to 75 gallons [227-340 litres] of mead a day,"" explains Mr Alexander. It's fair to say he is obsessed with mead. ""It's the quintessential local beverage - you can go anywhere in the world and find honey to make mead, and I think that's unique among alcoholic beverages,"" he gushes. After being introduced to the drink by a home brewer, Mr Alexander thought there were profits to be had in a commercial meadery. He founded Maine Mead Works in 2008, pouring his savings and money from friends and family into the business. His business has since grown, along with the popularity of mead in the US. It's now a seven-person operation that manufactures more than 7,500 cases a year, shipping them as far away as China. Mr Alexander is not the only one to have caught on to the commercial potential of mead. Vicky Rowe, the owner of mead information website GotMead, says interest in the product in the US has exploded in the past decade. ""We went from 30-40 meaderies making mead to somewhere in the vicinity of 250 in the last 10 years,"" she says. ""I like to say that everything old is new again - people come back to what was good once."" Even visitors to Mr Alexander's meadery agree. Tour participant Dirk Heseman admitted that while Maine Mead Works was the first meadery he'd actually visited, he has noticed that mead ""is becoming more and more available - similar to cider"". Just this year, commercial meaderies in the US have banded together to form an industry group, the American Mead Makers Association, to better share information and encourage growth in the industry. But there's a lot of work that needs to be done to improve the image of a drink long associated with Renaissance fairs and medieval re-enactments. ""I think our number one challenge as an industry is awareness of what mead is,"" says Mr Alexander. ""You ask 10 people in a room if they've ever heard of mead, and two of them might say, 'yes', and only one of them has had a very positive experience."" The mead of the past was often sweet, and didn't appeal to many drinkers",1,5,5

A report to Norwich City Council's planning committee, which meets on Thursday, advises councillors to approve the plans. Elderly residents were moved out of Greyhound Opening and nearby Goldsmith Street seven years ago after Norwich City Council agreed to redevelop the site. The council agreed that new employees relocating to the city could move in temporarily ahead of demolition. However other staff, including Ms Reeves, also moved in, in contravention of council policy. The council resisted calls for a full independent inquiry. Its own investigation found safeguards covering conflicts of interest were in place but not followed.

Some of the items found included an armour-piercing improvised rocket and two anti-personnel mines. The main line of police inquiry is the arms belonged to dissident republicans. Last week, Home Secretary Theresa May said MI5 believed an attack on targets in Great Britain by dissident republicans had become ""a strong possibility"". Analysis: Vincent Kearney, BBC News NI's home affairs correspondent The discovery of what appears to be a second dissident republican arms dump near Larne within three months has left police baffled. Based on location alone, the analysis would be that the items found most likely belonged to loyalist paramilitaries.

Det Supt Geddes said the seizure was significant ""both in terms of its size and its capability"". ""A number of these devices were ready to be deployed,"" he added. ""This seizure has undoubtedly saved lives."" He said the type of weapons that had been found meant police would focus their investigation on dissident republicans.

But his power, timing and focus returned in a supremely confident display at Glasgow's Hydro on Saturday night as he clinched the vacant WBA World Super-Lightweight title - and entered the record books as the first Scot to win world titles at three weights. Italy's Michele Di Rocco, at 34 a year older than Burns, hadn't lost a fight since September 2007. He arrived with a record of 40 wins and a draw from 42 bouts. He left a lesser figure. The referee deemed the man from Assisi to be in no state to continue in the eighth round, the result of a welter of blows to his head and body and made all the more unbearable by the hostile acoustic energy generated by 8,000 Scottish fans. Surely, for Burns, this was time to shout about his record, the ideal moment to counter all those who had written him off and questioned the wisdom of him leaving trainer Billy Nelson two years ago to work with Tony Sim in Essex? No. Instead, the champion spoke of his disbelief at the ease of his victory, his gratitude that he was safe, of his thanks to promoter Eddie Hearn, manager Alex Morrison and coach Sim for believing in him, and of his desire to celebrate with a fast-food burger and 20 chicken nuggets. ""When I got in the ring after the fight, I said, 'You've done it! You've done it!',"" reported a beaming Hearn at the post-fight media conference. ""And you know what Ricky said? 'Can you get a picture with me and Michael Buffer [the legendary American boxing ring announcer]?'"" When he has time to reflect during a well-earned holiday, Burns will take immense satisfaction at being only the third British-born fighter, after Bob Fitzsimmons and Duke McKenzie, to be a three-weight world champion. In Scottish terms, his achievements must mean that he is in the very top tier of boxing greats, comfortably mentioned in the same breath as former world champions Benny Lynch, Walter McGowan, Jackie Paterson, Ken Buchanan and Jim Watt, for example. Burns' record stands at 40 wins from 46 bouts. Remarkably, 11 of those have been world title fights. Buchanan's exploits in the United States add lustre to his legacy, but while Burns may never have fought someone like Roberto Duran, should Hearn manage to set up a bout against Cincinnati's Adrien Broner, the four-time world champion stripped of the WBA title because he could not make the weight, then Burns could achieve little more in the sport. ""There are some big fights out there for me,"" said Burns. ""I want to fight the top names. I will fight anybody. I do super-lightweight comfortably and lightweight is still an option. I would fight Terence Crawford again if it came down to it. ""That's nearly two years I have been with Tony and things have just started clicking.

Mark Stoneman (47) and Burns then put on an opening stand of 109 before Holland's medium pace had Stoneman lbw and Scott Borthwick bowled in a single over. Sean Ervine became the only man to dismiss Burns in 756 minutes of play when he missed a ball down the leg side, but Jason Roy and Dominic Sibley continued on until the conclusion. Surrey captain Rory Burns told BBC Radio London: ""I'm really pleased that we've fought that hard to get the draw and the extra five points, and obviously pretty happy with how I've played. ""We had to bat seven sessions to get us to safety and that's all I was thinking. ""There were some jitters in the nineties and I got a lifeline, which was quite nice. When I was getting close to 200, I was more thinking about the situation of getting to the follow-on mark. ""They're a good side and they played really well. We managed to hold on and get ourselves to safety, so it was honours even on a flat wicket.""",1,4,4

College principal Chris Wilkes said the decision was related to ""low student numbers rather than any other reason"". He said it would continue to focus on adult education. Famous Ruskin College alumni include former deputy prime minister John Prescott and Dennis Skinner, MP for Bolsover in Derbyshire. BA English Studies, BA History with Social Sciences and MA Women's Studies are being discontinued. Anne Hughes, 63, from Thame in Oxfordshire, has been studying BA English Studies part-time at the college for two years. She said she was ""absolutely distraught"" it was being cut. She is physically disabled and has depression, and said she chose to study at the college because it worked with ""disadvantaged, disabled and mature students"". The college also offers bespoke timetables, unlike some other places of higher education, she added. Online petitions have been set up in a bid to save the English faculty and the Women's Studies course. One signatory, Jenny Lewis, wrote on the first petition: ""[Tutors] Helen Kidd and Tom Sherry are carrying on the great Ruskin tradition of bringing opportunities to those that otherwise would not have them."" Student and activist Saskia Ritchie, who set up the second petition, said Ruskin had been set up for ""people who would traditionally be excluded from academia"" and gives ""access to truly excellent learning opportunities"". Mr Wilkes said the college would lose about 25 students as a result of the cuts. He added degrees had been on offer at the college for about 10 years and were ""relatively new"" considering the college's 116-year history. ""Our focus will continue to be on educating adults and I think what we're doing is just renewing our offer but doing it in a different way, fulfilling our mission in a different way, to perhaps how we've done it in the past,"" Mr Wilkes added. The college previously lost funding from the Skills Development Agency.",0,5,4

The sites now redirect to a message explaining they have been blocked ""by decision of public authorities"". In 2015, the authorities banned 11 popular pornography websites, saying many failed to protect children ""from information harmful to their health"". Analysis by Vitaliy Shevchenko, BBC Monitoring The decision was made following two separate court rulings, which said the websites ""spread pornography"". Sexually explicit content is not outlawed in Russia, but the law bans ""the illegal production, dissemination and advertisement of pornographic materials and objects"". It is not uncommon for Russia to ban websites. The government agency Roskomnadzor maintains a blacklist that now includes thousands of them. Access is usually blocked for violating the notoriously vague extremism legislation or child protection laws. Websites critical of the Kremlin have been blocked too, and at one point Wikipedia was blacklisted. Following the 2015 ban, one woman asked Roskomnadzor on Twitter whether it could recommend an alternative. The agency replied: ""You can meet someone in real life."" On Tuesday, it said its earlier tweet was ""still relevant"". However, open rights campaigners have warned that local bans can be defeated. ""Blocking porn is the fastest way to ensure widespread adoption of censorship circumvention in your country,"" said Eva Galperin, global policy analyst at the Electronic Frontier Foundation. One of the affected porn sites offered Roskomnadzor a premium subscription to its service, in exchange for lifting the ban. The government agency said it was ""not in the market"" for such an offer.

Ms Teal was previously arrested for protesting against the tree removals. Charges against her and 13 others were dropped earlier this year. More stories from across Yorkshire Sheffield City Council maintain that the removal of street trees in the city is lawful and necessary. A ""pre-action protocol letter"" from the council's legal department to Ms Teal warned the authority will seek a High Court injunction to stop her, and others involved in ""direct action"", from taking part in future protests. The council said the process would give protesters ""a chance to further and finally consider their position"" before it begins legal proceedings on 12 July. Councillor Bryan Lodge, cabinet member for Environment and Street Scene, said there had been months of ""unlawful and costly disruption"" to tree replacement works in Sheffield by a small number of protesters. ""We continue to support the right to peacefully protest, and the majority of protesters who are doing so peacefully will not be affected,"" he added. ""But there is a big difference between this and direct action which deliberately and unlawfully stops works from being carried out."" Mr Lodge said protesters had been sent a letter several weeks ago confirming their actions were unlawful. ""Streets Ahead is not just about street trees, it's about ensuring we have roads, pavements and a street scene to be proud of for many years to come,"" he added. ""In addition, it presents us with a unique opportunity to sustainably manage, increase and maintain our diverse street tree stock over a 25 year period."" The council said, despite the letter, works were still being disrupted ""causing city-wide delays"".",1,5,5

openai_text-davinci-002,"The English government is cutting back on its funding for local councils, causing many of them to struggle financially.","Byron Rhodes is taking me around the modern council headquarters. It's full of light. It's busy. The building has regenerated the area around Melton Mowbray's railway station, once a muddy pot-holed piece of wasteland where those in the know parked for free. Now the council offices link the station to a park and the town centre. It was partly paid for with insurance money after a fire destroyed the old offices on the other side of town. A supermarket moved in to replace it and helped with the money too, putting the council on a firm financial footing. But that was four years ago and the crisis is a different one today. It's being experienced by all local authorities - cuts in central government funding which threaten the services they provide. Mr Rhodes is also deputy leader of Leicestershire County Council, with responsibility for finance. Leicestershire is historically the poorest funded council in the country because of a quirk of Whitehall recalculations, going back a quarter of a century since the poll tax, or community charge, was scrapped. At the moment councils get income from council tax, a share of the business rates, any income they generate themselves from services plus a grant from central government. It's the grant cut which is causing them grief. What's called the ""core funding"" is worked out by the number of homes multiplied by a set amount. And each authority has a different value set per dwelling. If we look at Surrey, which is top of the table, the amount will be £1,686 by 2019/20. Nottinghamshire is mid-table at £1,482, Derbyshire is in the lower reaches with £1,422 per dwelling and then comes Leicestershire at £1,354. ""The funding system is chaotic,"" says Byron Rhodes. ""It doesn't reflect real need. Look at Oxfordshire which is an interesting example,"" he says with a glint in his eye. Could he possibly be referring to the prime ministerial plea to the county council about cutbacks to services there? ""If we had the same funding as Oxfordshire, we'd have £50m a year extra. If we had the same as Surrey, we'd have £100m more. We'd be partying everyday if we had that kind of money."" Leicestershire have been helped with a small share of what's been called transitional funding - about £300m to help councils following pressure from Conservative MPs. Think back to the vote on Sunday trading. With a majority of only 17 in the Commons, the Conservatives lost the vote when 20 odd rebelled. Last month there would've been another rebellion, including some of our own Tory MPs in the East Midlands, if something wasn't done to improve the local government finance settlement over the next four years. The money has gone largely to shire counties. Leicestershire got £6.6m spread over two years, enough to save some services from closure. But it's a drop in the ocean for an authority with a £19m black hole in the budget every year after the latest cutbacks. Labour have protested that 83% of the councils getting transition funding are Conservative-run. Many Labour-run",1,5,4

The group has warned that 750 more foster carers are ""urgently"" needed to meet the demands of the care system. It urged people to ""open their hearts and homes"" to vulnerable youngsters. Currently, more than 5,500 children are in foster care in Scotland, living with 4,400 families and carers. The Fostering Network surveyed 250 children, teenagers and foster carers across Scotland and discovered that many young people had failed to find stability. Almost half were already living with their third family, a quarter were with their fourth family and about 20 were living with their 10th family since going into care. There was a particular need for homes to be found for vulnerable teenagers, siblings and disabled children, the study found. Carla, 23, was taken into care at the age of 12 and had eight foster homes before moving in with the Randalls. ""Looking back now I realised that the Randalls saved my life,"" she said. ""I never understood the extent of the neglect and abuse I had endured until I came to live with a 'normal' loving family. ""They were just always themselves, the smallest details meant so much to me. ""They nurtured a young, angry, untrusting teenager to become a positive, empathetic and successful young woman."" The Fostering Network said instability had a detrimental effect on the child's education and wellbeing, while finding a stable foster carer from the outset could lead to improved relationships and a happier childhood. Sara Lurie, director of the Fostering Network Scotland, said: ""As each year passes, we see more and more children coming into care. ""We need people who can open their heart, and their homes, to vulnerable children and young people and use their skills to help support them to reach their full potential. ""In particular we need people who have the skills, patience and passion to look after teenagers who may have had a really tough time and be facing some real challenges, and to offer them love, stability and security. ""A good foster carer will believe in the ambition of the children in their care in the same way they'd believe in the ambition of their biological family members."" Apologies for the delay, see below as requested. A Scottish government spokeswoman said: ""Giving young people security is paramount and we have done a great deal of work with our partners across local government and the third sector to improve how we intervene early when there is a problem within families to find appropriate solutions quickly. ""We have also expanded the age at which young people can remain in foster care as part of the continuing care provisions and the support available when they transition into independent living.""",1,4,4

The City Deal scheme will see eight council areas around Glasgow receive about £1bn from the UK and Scottish governments. The councils also have the power to borrow extra cash. The Glasgow and Clyde Valley City Deal involved massive investment by both the Scottish and UK governments last year. Eight councils - Glasgow, East Renfrewshire, Renfrewshire, Inverclyde, North and South Lanarkshire and East and West Dunbartonshire - are involved. The City Deal scheme will see Westminster and Holyrood give £500m each in additional grant funding to the eight council areas. The councils will supplement this by borrowing £130m. Councillors from across all eight areas will meet to discuss some of the schemes. Several of the projects being discussed later are in East Renfrewshire, where £44m is expected to be invested over the next few years, with much of the money coming from the City Deal funding. One is a water sports park at the Dams to Darnley Country Park. It would open in 2017 and include a centre offering wakeboarding, the fastest-growing extreme sport in the world. A new railway station in Barrhead and sliproad from the M77 would serve an area which could become one of East Renfrewshire's fastest growth areas. The council expects 1,000 new homes to be built there. Another project would transform the Levern Works site in Barrhead. A site formerly occupied by Nestle, where pet food was once made, would be cleared. The site will then be marketed for development for a range of uses that will bring new jobs to Barrhead.

The apes began to disappear from the documents about 150 years ago, corresponding with population growth. The study is published in the Proceedings of the Royal Society B. Hainan gibbons are now limited to a few isolated patches of forest in the south west of China. They live in just four social groups, one of which was only discovered a few weeks ago. Understanding this population crash has been difficult, but the old government documents have helped to reveal when and how the numbers fell. Dr Sam Turvey, from the Zoological Society of London, said: ""China is one of the few places in the world that has a very very rich, long historical record. ""Because it has had such a complex bureaucracy for so long, there has been a lot of need for reporting - not just numbers of households for tax purposes and things like that, but also in terms of the kinds of natural resources that were available in the immediate environment."" These included records of animals, including gibbons, he said. ""We looked at the pattern of disappearance of gibbons through time and how that varied from place to place and the different environmental conditions and human pressures that were also present in these places."" The archives show that gibbons were a common sight in about 20 provinces in China well into the 17th and 18th Century. However, Dr Turvey said it was ""a stark contrast to their very imperilled position today"". ""We see a really steep increase in population decline and real population collapse across China about 100-150 years ago,"" he added. ""And this correlates with demographic expansion in China towards the end of the Imperial era and through the 20th Century, and the massive increase in deforestation and human population growth through the time of the Chinese Republic and the establishment of the communist party."" The researchers said a better understanding of the animals' decline would help them to establish a conservation plan for the country's last few Hainan gibbons. Dr Turvey said: ""It is an incredible privilege to be able to see gibbons in China in the wild. ""The Hainan gibbon is such as rare species, but knowing that this species is still hanging on there gives you hope that conservation will be able to bring that population back from the brink.""

Election officials have urged patience. Uhuru Kenyatta, who faces trial at the International Criminal Court, has been leading in early presidential results declared from Monday's tightly contested election. He is due to stand trial at The Hague next month for allegedly fuelling violence after the disputed 2007 election. He denies the charge. His closest rival is outgoing Prime Minister Raila Odinga. With provisional results in from more than 40% of polling stations earlier on Wednesday, Mr Odinga had 42% of the vote compared with Mr Kenyatta's 53%. However, Mr Odinga's allies remain confident that he will gain ground as results from his strongholds, including the Coast Province, are declared. More than 1,000 people were killed in the violence which broke out in 2007-08 after Mr Odinga claimed he had been cheated of victory by supporters of President Mwai Kibaki, who is stepping down after two terms in office. The BBC's Solomon Mugera in the capital, Nairobi, says Kenyans are becoming increasingly anxious about the delay in finalising the results. Some businesses and schools across the country have remained shut since Monday's election, he says.

Its website had stopped giving updated results from the presidential race on Wednesday, and was still showing figures from Tuesday night. Our correspondent says the large number of spoiled ballots - about 6% of the total vote, well over double the number of votes cast for the third-placed candidate, Musailia Mudavadi - has become a major bone of contention. Mr Odinga's Coalition of Reforms and Democracy (Cord) wants them to be counted, but Mr Kenyatta's Jubilee Coalition is resisting this. Late on Tuesday, the election commission announced that the spoiled ballots would count in the overall vote total, increasing the likelihood of a run-off between the top two candidates, news agencies report. Mr Kenyatta's running mate William Ruto, who is also facing a trial at the ICC, said foreign embassies may have influenced such a decision. ""We want to believe that this is not an attempt to deny the Jubilee Coalition a first-round victory as is clearly now on the wall,"" he is quoted by Reuters news agency as saying.

The cuts are being blamed on reduced government spending and a drop in National Lottery ticket sales - a major contributor to sports backing. Governing bodies are bracing themselves for potential job losses. About 60% of funding is made up from Scottish Government money, with lottery sales making up the rest. In the year ending 2015, total revenue was £65.1m, which is divided up and awarded to 52 sports. By the end of next year, that figure will have fallen to £51.8m - a cut to the Scottish sporting budget of 20% in just three years. sportscotland chairman Mel Young said: ""It's heartbreaking to me because I know the effort the sport governing bodies and the community that's around it; the volunteers and the mums and dads. ""And, to have to say that we're having to cut some money back is, I believe, not the right way to go."" Former badminton player Susan Egelstaff, a double bronze medallist at the Commonwealth Games [in 2002 and 2006] and an Olympian, fears the cuts will have ""a huge impact"". ""What that means in the future is that Scotland will be constantly playing catch-up,"" she said. ""It's almost impossible to catch up if you fall too far behind the leading nations."" The Scottish Government said sport and physical activity play a ""key role"" in a healthy Scotland and that ""significant"" investment would continue in those areas. ""Having successfully delivered the Commonwealth Games [in 2014] we are now focusing on protecting or raising investment in areas intended to decrease health inequality and improve life chances, and the small reduction in the sport budget allows us to support those priorities,"" Minister for Sport Aileen Campbell said.

The Supreme Court judges said some proposals breached rights to privacy and a family life under the European Convention on Human Rights.

A reading below 50 indicates falling output. It is the first time that activity in the sector has fallen since March 2013. Firms blamed soft domestic demand, a fall in new business from overseas and uncertainty ahead of the EU referendum. A slowdown in the oil and gas industry, a major customer for UK companies, is also hitting production. The index for new orders fell to 50.4 in April, from 51.9 the month before, matching February's three-year low. Rob Dobson, senior economist at Markit, said: ""On this evidence manufacturing production is now falling at a quarterly pace of around 1%, and will likely act as a drag on the economy again during the second quarter and putting greater pressure on the service sector to sustain GDP growth. ""The manufacturing labour market is also being impacted, with the data signalling close to 20,000 job losses over the past three months."" Last week, official figures showed UK economic growth slowed to 0.4% in the first quarter of the year from 0.6% in late 2015, propped up by the services sector. David Noble, group chief executive at the Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply (CIPS), said: ""Recent fears over a stall in the UK's manufacturing sector have now become a reality. ""An atmosphere of deep unease is building throughout the manufacturing supply chain, eating away at new orders, reducing British exports and putting more jobs at risk. ""A sense of apprehension across the sector is being caused by enduring volatility in the oil and gas industry, falling retailer confidence and the uncertainty created by the EU referendum."" The Markit/CIPS survey found new export orders contracted for the fourth straight month in April as the global economy continued to slow. A measure of employment in the manufacturing sector was also below the 50 mark for its fourth straight month. Lee Hopley, chief economist at the manufacturers' organisation, EEF, said: ""The sharp drop to a three-year low and another month of reported job cuts could be the clearest sign yet that referendum uncertainty is starting to weigh on the real economy.

The ruling preserves the law known as Obamacare, which Mr Obama considers a major part of his presidential legacy. Republicans have vowed to continue fighting the law. ""We've got more work to do, but what we're not going to do is unravel what has now been woven into the fabric of America,"" Mr Obama said. The case, known as King v Burwell, was the second major challenge the law has faced in the US's highest court. Unlike in many other western countries, the US does not have a single-payer healthcare system. Private companies, rather than the US government, provide health insurance for US citizens. The enactment of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) - one of Mr Obama's most significant and controversial domestic achievements - in 2010 mandated that every American had to purchase private insurance. It provided the subsidies to allow many to do so. In 2012, the mandate portion of the law was challenged in the court. The justices ruled to preserve it. In that decision, as in the decision on Thursday, Chief Justice John Roberts surprised observers by siding with his liberal colleagues in support of the law. ""Congress passed the Affordable Care act to improve health insurance markets, not to destroy them,"" Chief Justice John Roberts wrote in the opinion. Justice Anthony Kennedy dissented in 2012, but sided with the majority on Thursday. Had the court made the opposite decision, an estimated 8.7 million people in the US would have been at risk of losing the aid that makes healthcare affordable. The stakes could not have been higher. People's health (crucially important) and Obama's legacy (less important, but for him and those around him fairly vital) were at stake. Well a politically finely balanced Supreme Court has given an emphatic, overwhelming vote in favour of the president by 6-3. I bet ""No-drama Obama"" is high-fiving anyone and everyone in the White House - that is how big it is. Obama defies lame-duck expectations Demonstrators gathered outside the court as early on Thursday morning. Reading updates on their mobile phones, the crowd became jubilant when they learned mid-morning that the court had ruled in their favour. Some began dancing, while others chanted ""If you're covered and you know it clap your hands."" ""This is a big sigh of relief for millions across the country,"" said Ron Pollack of Families USA, a health-care advocacy organisation. ""The ACA is not just the law of the land, it will remain the law of the land"". ""Today is a good day for healthcare in America,"" said activist Benton Strong.

openai_text-davinci-002,"The Welsh Conservative party has seen a boost in confidence after the election, while Welsh Labour is facing challenges from within the party.","The Conservatives have been given a huge confidence boost and will feel in a position to challenge in more constituencies next year, rather than just on the list. At the party's weekly press briefing, I asked the Welsh Conservative leader Andrew RT Davies, who was elected on the list, whether he'd stand as a constituency candidate in his home turf of the Vale of Glamorgan but he said he hadn't thought about it. Presumably those are the kind of decisions they will now feel more confident contemplating. The party will also have a huge amount of new data on voters which it'll be able to call upon and the belief that campaigning hard on the NHS helped the Tories cross the line in places like the Vale of Clwyd and Gower. The Conservatives feel it's them, rather than any of the other opposition parties, who have become the repository of votes from those who are disaffected by the state of the NHS. Welsh Labour are going to hold a ""short sharp"" analysis into what went wrong. Carwyn Jones was in line with most of the criticism of Ed Miliband when he told AMs that the party needed to appeal to small business owners who are not millionaires but who work hard. What will be more difficult is countering the argument on the NHS, which the former minister Alun Davies believes is already lost. Another potential difficulty for Welsh Labour will be dealing with unhappiness within the party over council re-organisation. Bernie Attridge, the deputy leader of Flintshire Council, has tweeted saying the party needs to be careful on local government reform if it wants to retain the support of grassroots councillors. It also seems to have been the case that Labour lost more votes to UKIP than the Conservatives, which is another challenge to overcome. But Labour will at least have the advantage that it will be David Cameron, and not Ed Miliband, carrying out the latest round of public sector cuts that are likely to take effect sooner rather than later. The question is whether Carwyn Jones is going to be able to turn that to his advantage when his own record in government will be under scrutiny. Plaid Cymru's education spokesman, Simon Thomas, also in the party's weekly press briefing, said he believed Leanne Wood could portray herself as an alternative first minister because of the way she emotionally connected with people in the campaign. The party now has a year to make that a credible proposition after it failed to gain any new seats and came fourth, behind UKIP, in the overall share of the vote, despite her unprecedented profile. He also said that on the campaign trail people wanted to know what Plaid was going to do about the NHS and that people ""did not see the strengths"" of its arguments. The Welsh Liberal Democrats are still licking their wounds but in a ""je ne regrette rien"" moment, the leader Kirsty Williams said she had no regrets over the coalition. She has admitted the party failed to communicate",1,5,4

He said he would now look at the 125 existing marine protected areas to see if further improvements could be made. The Marine Conservation Society (MCS) described it as an ""embarrassing U-turn"" for the Welsh government, and has called for better protection of seas. Creating the zones would mean a ban on fishing and anchoring in some areas and had brought opposition. The Welsh Fishermen's Association said previously that existing conservation networks for Welsh waters are adequate. The Welsh government proposed the zones last year with the backing of the Countryside Council of Wales and the Marine Conservation Society. The minister for natural resources said the decision had been made after the thousands of responses to the consultation brought ""divergent and strongly held views"". Mr Davies said to ""avoid any continuing uncertainty over the options presented in the 2012 consultation, I am also withdrawing all the proposed sites"". His comments come after the findings were published of a task and finish team which reviewed the feedback. Now, he will concentrate on the existing 125 Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) that cover 36% of Welsh seas to see if any changes can be made rather than creating additional zones. ""We are now in a stronger position to assess our current contribution to the network's ecological coherence,"" he said. ""I have, therefore, commissioned an assessment of our current MPAs to identify if there are any gaps and what the options might be to fill those gaps. ""If any measures are required, I believe they should be simple, proportionate and fit for purpose."" Dr Peter Richardson, biodiversity programme manager for MCS, said the Welsh government ""spent an awful lot of time and money and encouraged other people to put effort into this consultation response"". He said: ""70% of the consultation responses were in favour of designating these sites and yet today the minister has announced he's scrapping the whole thing... bit of an embarrassing U-turn for the government I think.""

openai_text-davinci-002,"The appointment of former Celtic manager Neil Lennon as successor to Alan Stubbs at Easter Road suits both parties, because it is mutually beneficial.","His previous jobs were at Celtic and Bolton, but moving to the second tier of Scottish football was no hindrance to him returning to work at Easter Road. Lennon saw the vacancy as an opportunity, and that was enough to encourage Hibs that a figure of his profile and experience would accept a role in the Championship. Even though his last job in Scotland involved leading a team on Champions League duty, Lennon's mind has not been swayed by haughtiness. The appointment of the former Celtic manager as successor to Alan Stubbs suits both parties, because it is mutually beneficial. Success is alluring, and Hibs offer Lennon the chance to accumulate more achievements. He was immediately engaged in crisis management at his previous club Bolton, but will find stability, potential and accomplishment at Easter Road. The demand will be to deliver promotion, but that will not seem daunting when the majority of the squad that pushed Rangers for a while last season then won the Scottish Cup is still in place. Lennon's task is to refine and bolster the team, when new managers are often faced with a period of overhaul. Stubbs left the club on an emotional high after delivering their first Scottish Cup in 114 years, but before the final against Rangers there was a tangible sense of exasperation that promotion had been missed. Hibs were entitled to feel that it was an unnecessary failure given their circumstances. The club is about to embark on a third season in the Championship, but by most other measures they can be considered a top-flight outfit. The budget will be significantly more than the rest of the teams in the division, the training ground at East Mains and facilities are first-class, the football side of the business is stable and well-run by George Craig, the club's head of football operations, the squad is full of talent. Lennon can rely on consistently assured performances from the likes of David Gray, Darren McGregor, Paul Hanlon, Lewis Stevenson, John McGinn, Fraser Fyvie, Dylan McGeouch, James Keatings and Jason Cummings. Some minor issues remain, such as who will fill the goal next season, but the challenge is more on adding depth and strength of will to the squad and man-management. McGinn, one of the most reliably effective players in the Championship last season, has already insisted that he remains committed to Hibs despite the failure to achieve promotion. The 21-year-old midfielder provides the kind of industry and spirit that a team can be built around. There may be critical decisions to make, though, since Cummings is entering the final year of his contract and so represents a sellable asset. He is a regular goalscorer, though, and Stubbs had to sign Anthony Stokes on loan last January to provide some support up front. These are tweaks compared to the amount of work Stubbs had to carry out when he was appointed two years ago. Hibs are ready to be guided forward, not waiting to be rescued.

openai_text-davinci-002,The parents of a man killed by a drink driver are calling for the offence to be upgraded to manslaughter.,"Chris and Sue Moores's son Wayne died when his motorbike was struck by a drink driver in 2010. The couple spoke out in response to consultation on proposed reform of sentencing for driving offences. They believe increased sentences should be backed up by manslaughter charges. Mr Moores, 28, was killed by a Vauxhall Astra driven by Donna Hackett on the M4 near Swindon. Hackett, then aged 26, fled and was found by police asleep in a ditch. She served half of a six-year jail term after she was found guilty of causing death by careless driving while drunk. The Ministry of Justice consultation suggests offenders who cause death by careless driving while under the influence of drink or drugs could soon be handed a life sentence - an increase on the current 14-year upper limit. Source: Crown Prosecution Service But Mr and Mrs Moores, from Chandlers Ford, Hampshire, also want the offence to be upgraded to a charge of manslaughter. Mr Moores said: ""Somebody can drive drunk and kill my son. Why is that not manslaughter? ""Nothing can prepare a parent for seeing their child in the mortuary. That will stay with me every day, every day that vision comes into my mind. ""Our life is ruined."" Mrs Moores added: ""There's nothing careless about drink driving. I don't want anybody else to feel like us."" Ms Hackett, who lived in Radnor Street, Swindon, at the time of the offence, appealed against her sentence in September 2011, but was refused. A Ministry of Justice spokesperson said: ""We are determined to make sure those who kill whilst driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs face the full force of the law.

openai_text-davinci-002,"The race to buy BHS has been transformed by a late bid from retail veteran Greg Tufnell, with other bidders fading into the background.","BHS entered administration in April. Since then, efforts have been continuing to rescue it from closure and save the jobs of its 11,000 staff. Last week, a surprise late bid led by retail veteran Greg Tufnell transformed the race to acquire the retailer. His team, said to be backed by Portuguese money, is the front-runner. But if a deal cannot be struck, the business may still have to be liquidated. The remaining bidders have faded into the background. Another consortium led by Matalan tycoon John Hargreaves and Turkish retail entrepreneur Cafer Mahiroglu has reportedly run into difficulties, while other suitors have apparently failed to impress with their proposals. Some of those involved in the different bids have impressive retailing histories. But then Sir Philip Green, who controlled BHS from 2000 to 2015, also had a brilliant track record. And he ended up selling the business for Â£1. So what are the chances of saving BHS from the liquidators? And just who are the people aiming to do it? In the public eye, Greg Tufnell is easily overshadowed by his more famous brother Phil, the former England cricketer. But that could change if his bid for BHS is successful, because he hopes to become the firm's next chairman. And as far as his credentials for the job are concerned, the 54-year-old executive certainly talks the talk. He describes himself as ""a highly experienced managing director with Mothercare and Arcadia, a blend of entrepreneur, strategist and hands-on operator with significant commercial business turnaround, acquisition and fund-raising experience"". His record shows that he was buying and merchandising director at Next from 1991 to 1994. He then spent three years as managing director of menswear retailer Burton, part of the Arcadia group, followed by another three years as managing director of Mothercare. He currently appears to occupy a portfolio of different jobs, including the chairmanships of leather accessories brand Zatchels and recruitment consultancy hga Group. Earlier this month, he registered a new firm, Richess Group, at Companies House. Its other directors are Nick de Scossa, a Swiss banker, and Lisbon-based entrepreneur Jose Maria Soares Bento. Until Mr Tufnell's bid turned up, many observers had assumed that BHS would be snapped up by Matalan founder Mr Hargreaves. But it appears that the cost of a deal may have proved too high. Sources say Mr Hargreaves was asked to improve his offer and balked. Like Sir Philip Green, 71-year-old John Hargreaves also enjoys the life of the super-rich. He has an estimated fortune of Â£1bn, according to the Sunday Times Rich List. But in stark contrast to the ebullient Sir Philip, Mr Hargreaves is described by industry insiders as quiet-spoken, someone who shuns the limelight. Mr Hargreaves is no longer directly involved in the business he founded. He sold his 69% stake in Matalan in 2000, then in 2006 took it private through Missouri Bidco, a company 53.5% owned by him and his family. As a partner in Mr Hargreaves' bid, there is also Cafer Mahiroglu, the owner of Select Fashions. At 50, he is the youngest of",1,5,5

Senior coroner John Leckey is retiring this year and told a preliminary hearing of the inquest in Belfast that no replacement has been appointed.

Kingsmill is among dozens of inquests dating from the early days of the Troubles that face delay because not enough money is available to investigate or there is nobody to oversee fresh hearings.

Mr Oakden said: ""A member of the NEC had contacted the person that is putting this forward and said to them they need to follow the proper process of completing the necessary forms and submitting them to the NEC.

Morocco controls two-thirds of Western Sahara and sees it as part of its historic territory. However some, including the UN, see Western Sahara as Africa's last colony. Africa Live: More on this and other stories Find out more about Western Sahara A referendum was promised in 1991 but never carried out due to wrangling over who was eligible to vote. Thousands of Sahrawi refugees still live in refugee camps in Algeria - some have been there for 40 years. It is not clear what happens next but Western Sahara is hopeful that a committee set up by the AU will address the issues that both sides have raised. Some AU delegates said that it would be easier to resolve the issue with Morocco inside the AU. Sidi Mohammed, a Western Sahara official, told the BBC that Morocco's return to the AU means that it would now be expected to put ""in practice decisions taken by the AU with regard to a referendum in Western Sahara"". Mr Mohammed dismissed the suggestion that Morocco would now seek to get the AU to change its position, saying that the no country could unilaterally change the AU fundamental agreement, saying it opposed colonisation. In his speech at the AU summit, King Mohammed VI of Morocco said the readmission was not meant to divide the continental body. No. Algeria has always been a big supporter of Western Sahara's Polisario Front and it had wanted Morocco to accept independence of the territory as a condition for readmission. Zimbabwe and South Africa were also supportive of this stance but they were outnumbered by those who wanted Morocco back in the fold. There is no specific provision in the AU charter that bars any country from joining it. Morocco simply applied and the request was accepted by more than two-thirds of the 53 members. Morocco has been involved in intense lobbying and applied in July last year to rejoin the continental body. King Mohammed toured various African countries seeking support for the bid. No. While culturally the country's identity aligns with Arab states, its economic interests increasingly lie in Africa. This is a strategic move to continue exploring its interests in mining, construction, medical, insurance and banking sectors on the continent.

Mrs McAllister condemned the behaviour of some paramilitary inmates at Maghaberry Prison, who reportedly cheered, smoked cigars and mocked wardens at the high-security jail when news of Mr Ismay's death filtered through.

""My colleagues in Maghaberry dealt with it professionally, with great fortitude and with the courage they display on a daily basis.""

His intervention in the debate - made, as he termed it, with ""deafening eclat"" - was even said to have helped cause the pound to slide on the international money markets as traders thought it made the possibility of a so-called Brexit more likely. He has arguably the highest profile of any of the governing Conservative Party except the Prime Minister David Cameron, but those outside the UK may be wondering: who is he, and is that actually his hair? Read on. Profile: Boris Johnson How could 'zip wire prat' become prime minister? Read more about the UK's referendum on the EU Alexander Boris de Pfeffel Johnson, to give him his full name, was born in New York and is descended from Turkish, French and German stock. He describes himself as a ""one-man melting pot"". He first made a name for himself in journalism, including a stint as Brussels correspondent for the right-wing Daily Telegraph newspaper and editor of The Spectator magazine. His humorous persona led him to become a fixture on various television programmes, including the satirical BBC panel show Have I Got News For You. He still has a lucrative and entertaining column in the Daily Telegraph, in which august forum he explained the reasons for his decision on the EU. As a politician, he has been a Conservative member of parliament for two constituencies, Henley from 2001 to 2008 and then Uxbridge and South Ruislip from 2015. Lest you think he was putting his feet up between parliamentary mandates, he is also currently serving the second of two terms as mayor of London, no mean feat in a city where the centre-left Labour Party has dominated in recent decades. That's indicative of the position Mr Johnson has carved out for himself as one of the most charismatic politicians in the UK who has wide appeal beyond Conservative heartlands - polling has suggested that his stance on the EU referendum may sway some undecided voters. Just look what happens when you type his name into Google.co.uk. Not quite. He has previously courted controversy for his remarks about (among others) the populations of Liverpool, Portsmouth and Papua New Guinea, not to mention run-ins with his own party leadership and TV chef Jamie Oliver. Last October he accidentally flattened a 10-year-old schoolboy at what was meant to be a friendly game of photo-op rugby in Japan. But none of this seems to have affected his standing among the party faithful or the public at large. Even getting stuck on a zip-wire during the London Olympics in 2012, a sure-fire route to derision for any other politician, only enhanced his eccentric image. Mr Johnson finally ended months of speculation about which side of the EU debate he would back in an immaculately impromptu media scrum outside his home in North London, having reportedly informed the prime minister of his decision earlier the same day.

Speaking to BBC Asian Network, Mr Wilson, who has amassed nearly 1,000 buy-to-let properties in Kent, said a property he had bought from an Indian couple cost him about Â£12,000 because the curry smell became a ""massive problem"" and he was forced to rip up the carpet and take the house off the market for six months.

The hosts, slacker after the break, had beleaguered striker Larnell Cole sent-off after he confronted the referee. Liam Craig sealed the win from the penalty spot with two minutes to play, before Graham Cummins finished a sumptuous stoppage-time move. And things got worse still for Caley Thistle after the match, with captain Gary Warren shown a red card in the tunnel. Saints remain five points clear of Hearts in fourth place, and closed the gap on third-placed Rangers, who play Aberdeen on Sunday, to three points. With game after game ticking past, Inverness' position looks increasingly perilous. Next weekend's trip to Motherwell, second-bottom on goal difference, is now seismic. This contest turned nightmarish for the hosts after a bright opening, but the truth is, given their predicament, Caley Thistle did not threaten St Johnstone's goal enough. Billy Mckay sent a shot over from close range. Alex Fisher nodded a diving header wide. Carl Tremarco miscued a volley. Greg Tansey did draw a save from Alan Mannus when he rasped in an effort from outside the box, but Richie Foran's side never looked likely to find the net. Their best opportunity came immediately after the Saints went ahead, when Tansey fed Cole, who seemed to panic in a terrific position and shot straight at Mannus. Cole's dismissal ended the contest when he appeared to be cautioned twice for challenging referee Stephen Finnie's decision not to award a foul. St Johnstone were merciless and could have had more. With just one win from their last 21 league games, Inverness look deep in trouble. Tommy Wright's side deserve so much credit. Saints were tactically brilliant, so strong defensively and ruthlessly capitalised on their man advantage. They took one of their few first-half chances when Michael Coulson broke down the left and sent a dangerous ball across the six-yard box. Owain Fon Williams could only parry into the danger area, Cummins' shot was blocked but Maclean followed up to force it home. They should have had another when Craig's superb curling corner flew all the way to the back post where Cummins slid in and somehow knocked it over from two yards. Craig, in his 300th appearance for the club, coolly converted a spot-kick after Cummins was tripped to seal the points. Cummins then slammed home after Miller danced around the area to tee him up, before Craig cracked the bar amid the late flurry. With a tendency to finish the season strongly, and just a three-point gap to Rangers, the Perth side look capable of something special this term. Inverness CT manager Richie Foran: ""It is a tough time of the season to be sitting bottom, and I need real men to stand up to that, but not enough of them did that today. ""It is pure luck we are still in it and it is only four points. I sound like a broken record but one win changes it - that is the truth.

Freezing care provider fees to save money was no long sustainable, it said. Ministers say extra money will help NHS and social care services work together. The survey, which was completed by 147 directors of adult social services for councils in England, suggests that funding reductions to social care budgets have totalled £4.6bn since 2010 - a 31% overall reduction. Budgets for adult social care - which provides practical support to people due to illness, disability, old age or a low income - will reduce by a further £500m in cash terms this year, it said. ""Taking the growth in numbers of older and disabled people into account, this means that an additional £1.1bn would be needed to provide the same level of service as last year,"" the report warned. It said some councils had made savings in the past by freezing fees paid to providers, but care providers were now also facing financial problems. Some companies - particularly those in southern England - are struggling to attract staff, amid increasing concern about the quality of care, it said. ""What is at stake is the continuing capacity of adult social care to sustain services to those in greatest need,"" ADASS president Ray James said. ""In virtually all our authorities, the number in need is growing, while the complexity of their needs is increasing."" ADASS called for the government to ""protect essential care and support services to the most vulnerable members of our community"". But a government spokesman said the survey ""ignores"" a commitment to invest £10bn in health services that are being ""joined up"" with social care, by 2020. The BBC has launched an online guide to the care system for the over-65s. The ""care calculator"" covers residential care and the support provided in people's own homes, for tasks such as washing and dressing. Users can submit their postcode and find out how much each service costs where they live in the UK. There is also a dedicated BBC Cost of Care website, with news stories, analysis and video. The spokesman said: ""Increasing budgets isn't the only solution. By working innovatively and joining up health and social care we can improve care and also save money."" However, Councillor Izzi Seccombe, from the Local Government Association (LGA), said adult social care services were facing ""enormous pressures"" due to ""insufficient funding, growing demand and escalating costs"". ""We have long warned that investing in the NHS whilst social care budgets are under continual pressure is simply a false economy. ""It is social care services that support elderly and vulnerable people to maintain their independence, live in their own community and stay out of hospital longer,"" she added.

The group has warned that 750 more foster carers are ""urgently"" needed to meet the demands of the care system. It urged people to ""open their hearts and homes"" to vulnerable youngsters. Currently, more than 5,500 children are in foster care in Scotland, living with 4,400 families and carers. The Fostering Network surveyed 250 children, teenagers and foster carers across Scotland and discovered that many young people had failed to find stability. Almost half were already living with their third family, a quarter were with their fourth family and about 20 were living with their 10th family since going into care. There was a particular need for homes to be found for vulnerable teenagers, siblings and disabled children, the study found. Carla, 23, was taken into care at the age of 12 and had eight foster homes before moving in with the Randalls. ""Looking back now I realised that the Randalls saved my life,"" she said. ""I never understood the extent of the neglect and abuse I had endured until I came to live with a 'normal' loving family. ""They were just always themselves, the smallest details meant so much to me. ""They nurtured a young, angry, untrusting teenager to become a positive, empathetic and successful young woman."" The Fostering Network said instability had a detrimental effect on the child's education and wellbeing, while finding a stable foster carer from the outset could lead to improved relationships and a happier childhood. Sara Lurie, director of the Fostering Network Scotland, said: ""As each year passes, we see more and more children coming into care. ""We need people who can open their heart, and their homes, to vulnerable children and young people and use their skills to help support them to reach their full potential. ""In particular we need people who have the skills, patience and passion to look after teenagers who may have had a really tough time and be facing some real challenges, and to offer them love, stability and security. ""A good foster carer will believe in the ambition of the children in their care in the same way they'd believe in the ambition of their biological family members."" Apologies for the delay, see below as requested. A Scottish government spokeswoman said: ""Giving young people security is paramount and we have done a great deal of work with our partners across local government and the third sector to improve how we intervene early when there is a problem within families to find appropriate solutions quickly.

The apes began to disappear from the documents about 150 years ago, corresponding with population growth. The study is published in the Proceedings of the Royal Society B. Hainan gibbons are now limited to a few isolated patches of forest in the south west of China. They live in just four social groups, one of which was only discovered a few weeks ago. Understanding this population crash has been difficult, but the old government documents have helped to reveal when and how the numbers fell. Dr Sam Turvey, from the Zoological Society of London, said: ""China is one of the few places in the world that has a very very rich, long historical record. ""Because it has had such a complex bureaucracy for so long, there has been a lot of need for reporting - not just numbers of households for tax purposes and things like that, but also in terms of the kinds of natural resources that were available in the immediate environment."" These included records of animals, including gibbons, he said. ""We looked at the pattern of disappearance of gibbons through time and how that varied from place to place and the different environmental conditions and human pressures that were also present in these places."" The archives show that gibbons were a common sight in about 20 provinces in China well into the 17th and 18th Century. However, Dr Turvey said it was ""a stark contrast to their very imperilled position today"". ""We see a really steep increase in population decline and real population collapse across China about 100-150 years ago,"" he added. ""And this correlates with demographic expansion in China towards the end of the Imperial era and through the 20th Century, and the massive increase in deforestation and human population growth through the time of the Chinese Republic and the establishment of the communist party."" The researchers said a better understanding of the animals' decline would help them to establish a conservation plan for the country's last few Hainan gibbons. Dr Turvey said: ""It is an incredible privilege to be able to see gibbons in China in the wild.

A reading below 50 indicates falling output. It is the first time that activity in the sector has fallen since March 2013. Firms blamed soft domestic demand, a fall in new business from overseas and uncertainty ahead of the EU referendum. A slowdown in the oil and gas industry, a major customer for UK companies, is also hitting production. The index for new orders fell to 50.4 in April, from 51.9 the month before, matching February's three-year low. Rob Dobson, senior economist at Markit, said: ""On this evidence manufacturing production is now falling at a quarterly pace of around 1%, and will likely act as a drag on the economy again during the second quarter and putting greater pressure on the service sector to sustain GDP growth. ""The manufacturing labour market is also being impacted, with the data signalling close to 20,000 job losses over the past three months."" Last week, official figures showed UK economic growth slowed to 0.4% in the first quarter of the year from 0.6% in late 2015, propped up by the services sector. David Noble, group chief executive at the Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply (CIPS), said: ""Recent fears over a stall in the UK's manufacturing sector have now become a reality. ""An atmosphere of deep unease is building throughout the manufacturing supply chain, eating away at new orders, reducing British exports and putting more jobs at risk. ""A sense of apprehension across the sector is being caused by enduring volatility in the oil and gas industry, falling retailer confidence and the uncertainty created by the EU referendum."" The Markit/CIPS survey found new export orders contracted for the fourth straight month in April as the global economy continued to slow. A measure of employment in the manufacturing sector was also below the 50 mark for its fourth straight month. Lee Hopley, chief economist at the manufacturers' organisation, EEF, said: ""The sharp drop to a three-year low and another month of reported job cuts could be the clearest sign yet that referendum uncertainty is starting to weigh on the real economy.

The ruling preserves the law known as Obamacare, which Mr Obama considers a major part of his presidential legacy. Republicans have vowed to continue fighting the law. ""We've got more work to do, but what we're not going to do is unravel what has now been woven into the fabric of America,"" Mr Obama said. The case, known as King v Burwell, was the second major challenge the law has faced in the US's highest court. Unlike in many other western countries, the US does not have a single-payer healthcare system. Private companies, rather than the US government, provide health insurance for US citizens. The enactment of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) - one of Mr Obama's most significant and controversial domestic achievements - in 2010 mandated that every American had to purchase private insurance. It provided the subsidies to allow many to do so. In 2012, the mandate portion of the law was challenged in the court. The justices ruled to preserve it. In that decision, as in the decision on Thursday, Chief Justice John Roberts surprised observers by siding with his liberal colleagues in support of the law. ""Congress passed the Affordable Care act to improve health insurance markets, not to destroy them,"" Chief Justice John Roberts wrote in the opinion. Justice Anthony Kennedy dissented in 2012, but sided with the majority on Thursday. Had the court made the opposite decision, an estimated 8.7 million people in the US would have been at risk of losing the aid that makes healthcare affordable. The stakes could not have been higher. People's health (crucially important) and Obama's legacy (less important, but for him and those around him fairly vital) were at stake. Well a politically finely balanced Supreme Court has given an emphatic, overwhelming vote in favour of the president by 6-3. I bet ""No-drama Obama"" is high-fiving anyone and everyone in the White House - that is how big it is. Obama defies lame-duck expectations Demonstrators gathered outside the court as early on Thursday morning. Reading updates on their mobile phones, the crowd became jubilant when they learned mid-morning that the court had ruled in their favour. Some began dancing, while others chanted ""If you're covered and you know it clap your hands."" ""This is a big sigh of relief for millions across the country,"" said Ron Pollack of Families USA, a health-care advocacy organisation. ""The ACA is not just the law of the land, it will remain the law of the land"". ""Today is a good day for healthcare in America,"" said activist Benton Strong. ""I hope this is the end of the line."" Demonstrators opposing the subsidies did not have a large visible presence. Justice Antonin Scalia wrote in his dissent that the Supreme Court is setting a precedent of favouring some laws over others. ""We should start calling this law Scotuscare"" Justice Scalia wrote, referring to the court's acronym. ""Today's interpretation is not merely unnatural; it is unheard",1,5,5
openai_text-davinci-002 (0 shot),The Welsh Conservative party has been given a confidence boost after the election and will feel in a position to challenge in more constituencies next year.,"The Conservatives have been given a huge confidence boost and will feel in a position to challenge in more constituencies next year, rather than just on the list. At the party's weekly press briefing, I asked the Welsh Conservative leader Andrew RT Davies, who was elected on the list, whether he'd stand as a constituency candidate in his home turf of the Vale of Glamorgan but he said he hadn't thought about it. Presumably those are the kind of decisions they will now feel more confident contemplating. The party will also have a huge amount of new data on voters which it'll be able to call upon and the belief that campaigning hard on the NHS helped the Tories cross the line in places like the Vale of Clwyd and Gower. The Conservatives feel it's them, rather than any of the other opposition parties, who have become the repository of votes from those who are disaffected by the state of the NHS. Welsh Labour are going to hold a ""short sharp"" analysis into what went wrong. Carwyn Jones was in line with most of the criticism of Ed Miliband when he told AMs that the party needed to appeal to small business owners who are not millionaires but who work hard. What will be more difficult is countering the argument on the NHS, which the former minister Alun Davies believes is already lost. Another potential difficulty for Welsh Labour will be dealing with unhappiness within the party over council re-organisation. Bernie Attridge, the deputy leader of Flintshire Council, has tweeted saying the party needs to be careful on local government reform if it wants to retain the support of grassroots councillors. It also seems to have been the case that Labour lost more votes to UKIP than the Conservatives, which is another challenge to overcome. But Labour will at least have the advantage that it will be David Cameron, and not Ed Miliband, carrying out the latest round of public sector cuts that are likely to take effect sooner rather than later. The question is whether Carwyn Jones is going to be able to turn that to his advantage when his own record in government will be under scrutiny. Plaid Cymru's education spokesman, Simon Thomas, also in the party's weekly press briefing, said he believed Leanne Wood could portray herself as an alternative first minister because of the way she emotionally connected with people in the campaign. The party now has a year to make that a credible proposition after it failed to gain any new seats and came fourth, behind UKIP, in the overall share of the vote, despite her unprecedented profile. He also said that on the campaign trail people wanted to know what Plaid was going to do about the NHS and that people ""did not see the strengths"" of its arguments. The Welsh Liberal Democrats are still licking their wounds but in a ""je ne regrette rien"" moment, the leader Kirsty Williams said she had no regrets over the coalition. She has admitted the party failed to communicate",1,4,4

He said he would now look at the 125 existing marine protected areas to see if further improvements could be made. The Marine Conservation Society (MCS) described it as an ""embarrassing U-turn"" for the Welsh government, and has called for better protection of seas. Creating the zones would mean a ban on fishing and anchoring in some areas and had brought opposition. The Welsh Fishermen's Association said previously that existing conservation networks for Welsh waters are adequate. The Welsh government proposed the zones last year with the backing of the Countryside Council of Wales and the Marine Conservation Society. The minister for natural resources said the decision had been made after the thousands of responses to the consultation brought ""divergent and strongly held views"". Mr Davies said to ""avoid any continuing uncertainty over the options presented in the 2012 consultation, I am also withdrawing all the proposed sites"". His comments come after the findings were published of a task and finish team which reviewed the feedback. Now, he will concentrate on the existing 125 Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) that cover 36% of Welsh seas to see if any changes can be made rather than creating additional zones. ""We are now in a stronger position to assess our current contribution to the network's ecological coherence,"" he said. ""I have, therefore, commissioned an assessment of our current MPAs to identify if there are any gaps and what the options might be to fill those gaps. ""If any measures are required, I believe they should be simple, proportionate and fit for purpose."" Dr Peter Richardson, biodiversity programme manager for MCS, said the Welsh government ""spent an awful lot of time and money and encouraged other people to put effort into this consultation response"". He said: ""70% of the consultation responses were in favour of designating these sites and yet today the minister has announced he's scrapping the whole thing... bit of an embarrassing U-turn for the government I think.""

Earlier, every stage at the event was closed after lightning struck ground. Dance act Rudimental were escorted off the main stage mid-set, and had to abandon their planned encore - Feel The Love, with guest vocalist John Newman. ""We're quite upset,"" musician Amir Amor told the BBC, ""but we had a great time anyway"". Metallica's Lars Ulrich was flying into the site by helicopter as the storm descended. ""It was kind of frightening,"" he said. ""When we landed, all the people picking us up were going, 'we didn't expect you were going to fly in this weather'. ""But the pilot didn't say anything about that. We saw the lightning up there. I thought it was pyrotechnics for Arcade Fire."" The thunderstorm heralded a brief but torrential downpour, and the power cut took BBC coverage off the air. Music resumed on the main stage at 19:00 BST with Lily Allen, who dedicated an expletive-laden song to FIFA president Sepp Blatter. Other performers on Friday included Blondie, who proved so popular it became impossible to enter or leave The Other Stage at lunchtime, and Paolo Nutini, whose soulful ballads were a fitting soundtrack as dusk fell over Somerset. Sophie Ellis-Bextor sneaked some disco into her set at the largely-acoustic Avalon Stage, while the pulsing synthpop of Glaswegian band Chvrches made for a steamy atmosphere in the John Peel tent as fans danced off the downpour. Arcade Fire took to the stage shortly after 22:00 BST, their arrival heralded by a man dressed from head-to-toe in a mirrored suit. Bravely, considering the weather conditions, the 12-piece band were largely dressed in white, but if they were worried about laundry bills, it didn't show. They threw themselves around the stage, thrashing and spinning as though plagued by a swarm of invisible bees, each member switching instruments between - and often during - songs. As well as guitars, they played steel drums, xylophones and even a hurdy gurdy.

The set list was evenly spread across their four albums, with highlights including No Cars Go, Neighborhood #1 (Tunnels) and Rebellion (Lies). The group's recurring subject matter of suburban despair and alienation might have seemed like an odd fit for Glastonbury's peace and love ethos, but there is an optimism and belief in humanity at the core of their music.

He added: ""We have a lot of beautiful things to fight for and to qualify for the Champions League will be a huge success. But we have to be honest with ourselves.

Guardiola has also responded to questions about a row between City and Chelsea coaching staff at Stamford Bridge following the defeat on Wednesday night. There have been conflicting claims about the precise nature of the row, but stewards were needed to calm the situation down after Chelsea's 2-1 win. The incident centred around a disagreement between Chelsea fitness coach Paolo Bertelli and Manchester City masseur Mark Sertori, both of whom speak Italian, as the Premier League leaders celebrated their victory. Guardiola said: ""We are so polite in our defeats and we are so polite when we win. When we win, normally we celebrate a little bit, then we go to the locker room.

Lee, 84, has never explained why she stopped writing. She doesn't give interviews - ""Hell, no"" was her response to a request several decades ago - and that silence has only added to the intrigue. But her close friend Thomas Lane Butts, a retired minister in her hometown, Monroeville, Alabama, says she once told him the reason. Sitting on a pew in the Methodist church which the Lee family still attends, he described to me how she suddenly brought the subject up one night over dinner in New York. ""She asked me, 'You ever wonder why I didn't write anything else?' And I said, 'Along with several million other people, yes, I had wondered about that.' And she said, 'Well, what do you think?'"" Speaking in his slow southern drawl, the Rev Butts, who just turned 80, suggested to her that she had already written a great book and therefore didn't need to compete with herself. ""And when I got through she said, 'You're all wrong.' I said, 'Alright, smart Alec. You tell me.' She said, 'I would not go through all the deprivation of privacy through which I went for this book again for any amount of money.' ""And she said, 'I did not need to write another book. I said what I wanted to say in that book.'"" Harper Lee called it a simple tale about the ""conflict of the human soul"" and Monroeville, Alabama, is where she drew her inspiration. The story depicts the segregated South of her childhood, during the Depression. It was published at the height of the civil rights struggle. The Rev Butts grew up 10 miles outside Monroeville. By the late 1950s, he says, he was a ""fuzzy-cheeked young preacher"" campaigning for an end to segregation. He had met Martin Luther King Jr and signed a petition to boycott buses. The Ku Klux Klan had left a burning cross on his front lawn. He says To Kill a Mockingbird was not well received in Monroeville when it was published. ""The people who were hard racist did not like it because of the implication of the book,"" the Rev Butts told me. ""The book revealed racism and that always frightens a racist - when you pull the cover off them. ""Those of us who stood up for civil rights were much encouraged by the book because in a very skilful and subtle way it addressed itself for justice."" But these days, the Rev Butts says, there is enormous civic pride in Monroeville. The old courthouse, which Hollywood re-created for the film, now houses a museum to Harper Lee and the town's other literary icon, Truman Capote. Capote was a childhood friend of hers and is thought to be the inspiration for the Dill character in To Kill a Mockingbird. The town's residents often try to protect Lee, allowing her to live a normal life instead of being hounded by fans or bothered with prying questions. ""Being famous",1,4,4

In response, Number 10 said there were ""many difficult challenges"" in Libya, while the White House said it deeply valued the UK's contributions. Downing Street did not comment on President Obama's remark to the PM about defence spending, reportedly made before Chancellor George Osborne said the government would fulfil a Nato pledge to spend 2% of national income on defence last year. In response to the interview, a spokesman for the US National Security Council said Mr Cameron had been ""as close a partner as the president has had"" adding that ""we deeply value the UK's contributions on our shared national security and foreign policy objectives"". BBC North America editor Jon Sopel said the unsolicited statement put out by the White House suggested Downing Street had reacted angrily to the article. ""It's like we've seen a curtain drawn back on the unspun thoughts of President Obama, complete with frustration as well, and what we've seen tonight is the White House trying to close the curtain as quickly as it can,"" he added. The toppling of the Gaddafi regime in Libya - following UN-backed air strikes designed to protect civilians - led to a power vacuum and instability, with no authority in full control. The intervention was led by the UK and France - and in his interview, Mr Obama reflects on ""what went wrong"", saying: ""There's room for criticism, because I had more faith in the Europeans, given Libya's proximity, being invested in the follow-up."" Mr Cameron, he said, became ""distracted by a range of other things"". He also criticised former French President Nicolas Sarkozy, saying he had tried to claim the spotlight. The former French president, he said, ""wanted to trumpet the flights he was taking in the air campaign, despite the fact that we had wiped out all the air defences and essentially set up the entire infrastructure"" for the intervention. President Obama said the intervention ""averted large-scale civilian casualties (and) prevented what almost surely would have been a prolonged and bloody civil conflict"".

But his power, timing and focus returned in a supremely confident display at Glasgow's Hydro on Saturday night as he clinched the vacant WBA World Super-Lightweight title - and entered the record books as the first Scot to win world titles at three weights. Italy's Michele Di Rocco, at 34 a year older than Burns, hadn't lost a fight since September 2007. He arrived with a record of 40 wins and a draw from 42 bouts. He left a lesser figure. The referee deemed the man from Assisi to be in no state to continue in the eighth round, the result of a welter of blows to his head and body and made all the more unbearable by the hostile acoustic energy generated by 8,000 Scottish fans. Surely, for Burns, this was time to shout about his record, the ideal moment to counter all those who had written him off and questioned the wisdom of him leaving trainer Billy Nelson two years ago to work with Tony Sim in Essex? No. Instead, the champion spoke of his disbelief at the ease of his victory, his gratitude that he was safe, of his thanks to promoter Eddie Hearn, manager Alex Morrison and coach Sim for believing in him, and of his desire to celebrate with a fast-food burger and 20 chicken nuggets. ""When I got in the ring after the fight, I said, 'You've done it! You've done it!',"" reported a beaming Hearn at the post-fight media conference. ""And you know what Ricky said? 'Can you get a picture with me and Michael Buffer [the legendary American boxing ring announcer]?'"" When he has time to reflect during a well-earned holiday, Burns will take immense satisfaction at being only the third British-born fighter, after Bob Fitzsimmons and Duke McKenzie, to be a three-weight world champion. In Scottish terms, his achievements must mean that he is in the very top tier of boxing greats, comfortably mentioned in the same breath as former world champions Benny Lynch, Walter McGowan, Jackie Paterson, Ken Buchanan and Jim Watt, for example. Burns' record stands at 40 wins from 46 bouts. Remarkably, 11 of those have been world title fights. Buchanan's exploits in the United States add lustre to his legacy, but while Burns may never have fought someone like Roberto Duran, should Hearn manage to set up a bout against Cincinnati's Adrien Broner, the four-time world champion stripped of the WBA title because he could not make the weight, then Burns could achieve little more in the sport.

The permit does not allow the company to carry out fracking - hydraulic fracturing of the land - to extract any oil or gas. Fracking is subject to a temporary ban in Wales until decision-making powers on the practice are devolved. Natural Resources Wales said it had carried out a ""thorough assessment"" of the company's plans before approving them, with all work including reinstatement of the land to be completed within 12 months. ""It's important that any activity of this kind doesn't harm the environment, and this permit makes it clear what Coastal Oil and Gas Limited will need to do to comply with this,"" a spokesman said. ""Once the work begins, our officers will regulate and monitor the site to ensure it complies with the conditions of the permit, to protect people and the environment."" The permit for exploratory drilling comes despite a moratorium on fracking in Wales pending devolution of responsibility for such decisions. In August, the UK government urged councils in England to speed up the process of approval for fracking projects. However, Natural Resources Minister Carl Sargeant said fracking technology was ""unproven"", and that Welsh Labour ministers preferred to look at renewable energy.",1,5,5

It also says they should not ratify a similar deal that has already been done between the EU and Canada. It says some aspects pose a threat to democracy and the rule of law. One of the concerns mentioned in the petition is the idea of tribunals that foreign investors would be able to use in some circumstances to sue governments. There is a great deal of controversy over exactly what this system, known as Investor State Dispute Settlement, would enable companies to do, but campaigners see it as an opportunity for international business to get compensation for government policy changes that adversely affect them. This kind of provision exists in many bilateral trade and investment agreements. Friends of the Earth have published new research on the impact they have had on EU countries. Information about these cases is not always made public, but the group says that going back to 1994, foreign investors have sought compensation of almost €30bn (£24bn) from 20 states. Where the results are known (a small minority of the total), the tribunals have awarded total compensation of €3.5bn (about £2.8bn). In Britain, the possible implications of this provision for the National Health Service have been especially controversial. Campaigners believe that the investor tribunals would make it harder to reverse any decisions to contract services out to international healthcare firms. John Hilary of War on Want said: TTIP ""will make it impossible for any future government to repeal the Health & Social Care Act and bring the NHS back into public hands"". The petition lists a number of other areas where its signatories believes European standards would suffer if the TTIP negotiations are completed and the Canada deal is ratified: employment, social, environmental, privacy and consumer protection. The European Commission says the EU will not have to sacrifice its high standards. It also says investor protection provisions are important for investment flows and have in general worked well. But it accepts there is a need for improvement and is trying to achieve that in its bilateral negotiations. The petition has been organised as an exercise called a European Citizens' Initiative which can lead to a public hearing in the European Parliament and require the European Commission to give a formal response explaining why it is accepting or rejecting what the petitioners call for. The European Commission has already said that the petition doesn't qualify as such an Initiative. Campaigners have launched a legal challenge to this decision.",1,5,5

Some of the items found included an armour-piercing improvised rocket and two anti-personnel mines. The main line of police inquiry is the arms belonged to dissident republicans. Last week, Home Secretary Theresa May said MI5 believed an attack on targets in Great Britain by dissident republicans had become ""a strong possibility"". Analysis: Vincent Kearney, BBC News NI's home affairs correspondent The discovery of what appears to be a second dissident republican arms dump near Larne within three months has left police baffled. Based on location alone, the analysis would be that the items found most likely belonged to loyalist paramilitaries. But the nature of what was found suggests otherwise and the finger of suspicion firmly in the direction of dissident republicans. Det Supt Kevin Geddes said the threat level in Northern Ireland from dissident republican groups remains ""severe"" and an attack is ""highly likely"". Police officers found three barrels hidden in holes in the forest. As well as rockets and mines, there were also several pipe bombs, assault rifle ammunition and parts to construct a ""substantial number of explosive devices"". Det Supt Geddes said the seizure was significant ""both in terms of its size and its capability"". ""A number of these devices were ready to be deployed,"" he added. ""This seizure has undoubtedly saved lives."" He said the type of weapons that had been found meant police would focus their investigation on dissident republicans. In March, an arms find was made at Carnfunnock Country Park near Larne, and police said the were investigating a connection between the two discoveries. ""There are links in terms of the general location and the manner and method of storage and packaging of these munitions,"" Det Supt Geddes said.

openai_text-davinci-002 (0 shot),"The article discusses how England almost won the first test against Pakistan, but ultimately fell short due to some mistakes earlier in the match.","Pakistan seemed to be cruising to a draw before debutant Adil Rashid - who returned 0-163 in the first innings - turned the match with five wickets. Needing 99 to win, England sent out Jos Buttler and Ben Stokes in the top four. But they were eventually beaten by the fading light, finishing 25 runs short of a famous victory on 74-4. The tourists could not find the boundary frequently enough before the umpires brought the teams off, with Joe Root 33 not out. However, this was a hugely impressive performance from England and one that will fill them with confidence ahead of the second Test in Dubai, which begins on Thursday. After England concluded their innings on 598-9 in the morning, Pakistan looked assured at 113-3 shortly after tea, leading by 38 with seven second-innings wickets remaining. But the match turned when veteran batsman Younus Khan, playing in his 102nd Test match, mistimed a wild heave to give Rashid his first Test wicket - caught at point by Stokes. Rashid - whose figures in the first innings were the worst ever by a debutant - then quickly added a second victim, having Asad Shafiq caught behind for six. The door was opened for England, and Rashid and Moeen Ali barged through it as they polished off the last five wickets for 14 runs. Pakistan skipper Misbah ul-Haq - who had played with restraint for his 51 - inexplicably aimed an uncharacteristic slog at Moeen and was bowled. Moeen then removed Wahab Riaz caught behind, before Rashid claimed the final three wickets - all superbly caught at first slip by James Anderson. England sensed an unlikely victory, but their reorganised batting order could not score quickly enough as Pakistan's tactic of spin from both ends and fielders on the boundary brought them regular wickets. Makeshift opener Buttler was trapped lbw for four, Moeen and Stokes were caught on the boundary in quick succession, and Jonny Bairstow was stumped attempting a big shot. However, in truth it was mistakes earlier in the match that ultimately proved more costly as England fell just short of their first win on the subcontinent since beating India in Kolkata in 2012. In Pakistan's first innings, Ian Bell dropped Mohammad Hafeez (98) and Shafiq (107) at slip early in their innings. And Shoaib Malik, who made 245, was dismissed off a no-ball by Stuart Broad. England captain Alastair Cook, whose record-breaking 263 in the first innings was ultimately in vain, admitted England were frustrated to come so close to victory. ""We'd have liked another three or four overs at the end but that's the way it goes,"" he said. ""I can't fault the guys for hanging in there on that wicket.

Appointments affected include scans and consultations with specialists - including those for cancer patients. The British Medical Association said such incentives were ""misguided"". At least nine clinical commissioning groups (CCGs) were offering GP practices payments for hitting targets, according to Pulse's investigation. In one case, Birmingham South Central CCG was offering practices more than Â£11,000 to reduce new outpatient attendances, follow-ups, A&E attendances and emergency admissions by 1%, compared with 2014/15. It said the schemes, which exclude cancer referrals, were designed to ""incentivise best quality practice"" and ""drive improvements in the quality of primary medical care"". ""Our priority is to ensure that patients have access to services that they need, when they need them,"" said a spokesperson for Birmingham South Central CCG. Another CCG told Pulse it had considered the ""full impact"" of the incentive scheme and was ""confident that there is no conflict of interest"". Pulse said that one scheme had already been looked at by the General Medical Council, the body which regulates medical standards in the UK, after local GP leaders expressed their concern. The magazine pointed out that initial hospital referrals for cancer patients should happen within two weeks of a GP first suspecting the condition. Dr Chand Nagpaul, chairman of the GPs committee of the doctors' trade union the British Medical Association, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that such schemes were a ""financial contaminant"" to patient-doctor trust. He said: ""It's short-sighted and misguided of CCGs to introduce such mechanisms, because they do lead to the potential for patients questioning the motives of GP referrals. ""We believe it is far more appropriate for CCGs to introduce clinical pathways that ensure patients are referred appropriately rather than these crude, salesman-like bonuses which pay GPs simply to make reduction to referrals in numerical terms."" Dr Peter Melton is local GP and clinical chief officer for North East Lincolnshire CCG, which offers the equivalent of more than Â£6,000 to practices that reduce outpatient referrals to the same level as the 25% with the lowest referral rates (which include two-week urgent cancer referrals) in 2014/15. He said the CCG was already among the best in England for referring suspected cancer patients to a consultant within two weeks and the scheme was not about avoiding sending people to hospital. ""It is not focussing on referral reduction per se but on better clinical and quality standards for the patient,"" he explained. ""The expectation is practices will be encouraged to investigate more locally and monitor the patient in the first instance rather than automatically refer in to a secondary care service."" Analysis by the BBC's Helen Briggs The NHS is under pressure to make savings, with a target of carving out Â£22bn of efficiency savings by 2020.

openai_text-davinci-002 (0 shot),"The article discusses how Hibs are a well-run club with a lot of potential, and that new manager Neil Lennon is a good fit for the team.","His previous jobs were at Celtic and Bolton, but moving to the second tier of Scottish football was no hindrance to him returning to work at Easter Road. Lennon saw the vacancy as an opportunity, and that was enough to encourage Hibs that a figure of his profile and experience would accept a role in the Championship. Even though his last job in Scotland involved leading a team on Champions League duty, Lennon's mind has not been swayed by haughtiness. The appointment of the former Celtic manager as successor to Alan Stubbs suits both parties, because it is mutually beneficial. Success is alluring, and Hibs offer Lennon the chance to accumulate more achievements. He was immediately engaged in crisis management at his previous club Bolton, but will find stability, potential and accomplishment at Easter Road. The demand will be to deliver promotion, but that will not seem daunting when the majority of the squad that pushed Rangers for a while last season then won the Scottish Cup is still in place. Lennon's task is to refine and bolster the team, when new managers are often faced with a period of overhaul. Stubbs left the club on an emotional high after delivering their first Scottish Cup in 114 years, but before the final against Rangers there was a tangible sense of exasperation that promotion had been missed. Hibs were entitled to feel that it was an unnecessary failure given their circumstances. The club is about to embark on a third season in the Championship, but by most other measures they can be considered a top-flight outfit. The budget will be significantly more than the rest of the teams in the division, the training ground at East Mains and facilities are first-class, the football side of the business is stable and well-run by George Craig, the club's head of football operations, the squad is full of talent. Lennon can rely on consistently assured performances from the likes of David Gray, Darren McGregor, Paul Hanlon, Lewis Stevenson, John McGinn, Fraser Fyvie, Dylan McGeouch, James Keatings and Jason Cummings. Some minor issues remain, such as who will fill the goal next season, but the challenge is more on adding depth and strength of will to the squad and man-management. McGinn, one of the most reliably effective players in the Championship last season, has already insisted that he remains committed to Hibs despite the failure to achieve promotion. The 21-year-old midfielder provides the kind of industry and spirit that a team can be built around. There may be critical decisions to make, though, since Cummings is entering the final year of his contract and so represents a sellable asset. He is a regular goalscorer, though, and Stubbs had to sign Anthony Stokes on loan last January to provide some support up front. These are tweaks compared to the amount of work Stubbs had to carry out when he was appointed two years ago. Hibs are ready to be guided forward, not waiting to be rescued.

That is down from 6.1% in the previous quarter. Analysts were expecting the same figure for January to March. India is the third-largest economy in Asia but has been struggling with inflation and currency weakness. Since July last year, the Indian rupee has seen one of the biggest declines among Asian currencies, dropping more than 27% against the US dollar. ""Shocking numbers as growth was even lower than lows witnessed during the financial crisis,"" said Anubhuti Sahay from Standard Chartered Bank in Mumbai. The BBC's Yogita Limaye in Mumbai said that just a year ago India was aspiring for double-digit growth. But a global slowdown has reduced external demand, and high inflation coupled with a weak rupee has made things more expensive within the country. Domestic demand, which India's economy is largely reliant on, has also slowed in part due to the political upheaval in the country. India's economy is suffering from ""policy incoherence, shifting global risk appetite and a comatose government"", said Rajeev Malik, senior economist at brokerage CLSA India's Prime Minister Manmohan Singh admitted early this month that his government must do more to get the once fast-growing economy moving again. The Congress-led coalition government is caught up in a slew of corruption scandals. Key policy reforms, including allowing foreign investment in India's retail sector, have been delayed in parliament for more than a year.

Thousands of Sahrawi refugees still live in refugee camps in Algeria - some have been there for 40 years. It is not clear what happens next but Western Sahara is hopeful that a committee set up by the AU will address the issues that both sides have raised. Some AU delegates said that it would be easier to resolve the issue with Morocco inside the AU. Sidi Mohammed, a Western Sahara official, told the BBC that Morocco's return to the AU means that it would now be expected to put ""in practice decisions taken by the AU with regard to a referendum in Western Sahara"". Mr Mohammed dismissed the suggestion that Morocco would now seek to get the AU to change its position, saying that the no country could unilaterally change the AU fundamental agreement, saying it opposed colonisation. In his speech at the AU summit, King Mohammed VI of Morocco said the readmission was not meant to divide the continental body. No. Algeria has always been a big supporter of Western Sahara's Polisario Front and it had wanted Morocco to accept independence of the territory as a condition for readmission. Zimbabwe and South Africa were also supportive of this stance but they were outnumbered by those who wanted Morocco back in the fold. There is no specific provision in the AU charter that bars any country from joining it. Morocco simply applied and the request was accepted by more than two-thirds of the 53 members. Morocco has been involved in intense lobbying and applied in July last year to rejoin the continental body. King Mohammed toured various African countries seeking support for the bid. No. While culturally the country's identity aligns with Arab states, its economic interests increasingly lie in Africa.

Last month, the Supreme Court ruled that the anthem must be played in every cinema before a film is screened.

Also, India's colonial-era sedition law has been often used against students, journalists, writers and social activists and those critical of the government.

""We were [rehearsing] in the tent for about a week and a half, then we had to move to bigger studios in Hollywood where we are working on the rest of the show,"" she told Houston radio station Mix 96.5. ""And then we will send that equipment to Houston where we will finish rehearsals. Fans can expect a performance that spans my career so far."" She has a high standard to live up to - notably Prince's show in 2007, which took place in the middle of a Miami thunderstorm and is widely accepted as the greatest performance in the event's history, if not Prince's career. Here are some of the other most memorable - and surprising - moments from the last 30 years. Super Bowl performers get a very strict 12-minute time limit, so most performers cram their set with as much music as possible. Not Michael Jackson. After shooting onto the stage at the Pasadena Rose Bowl, he stood completely still, staring at the world for a full 90 seconds. Ninety. It was a master class in ratcheting expectation to a fever pitch. And the screams when he launched into Jam (not one of his best songs) proved he knew what he was doing. Brilliantly, Jackson staged this entire performance while wearing a jacket it looked like he'd borrowed from Muammar Gaddafi. Beat that, Gaga. Baby, he was born to run... and slide on his knees... and crotch slam a TV camera. In his autobiography, The Boss explains the incident like this: ""Too much adrenalin, a late drop, too much speed, here I come, Mikeâ€¦ BOOM! ""And I'm onto his camera, the lens implanted into my chest with one leg off the stage. I use his camera to push myself back up andâ€¦ BLAM! BORN TO RUN!""

Since then, efforts have been continuing to rescue it from closure and save the jobs of its 11,000 staff. Last week, a surprise late bid led by retail veteran Greg Tufnell transformed the race to acquire the retailer. His team, said to be backed by Portuguese money, is the front-runner. But if a deal cannot be struck, the business may still have to be liquidated. The remaining bidders have faded into the background. Another consortium led by Matalan tycoon John Hargreaves and Turkish retail entrepreneur Cafer Mahiroglu has reportedly run into difficulties, while other suitors have apparently failed to impress with their proposals. Some of those involved in the different bids have impressive retailing histories. But then Sir Philip Green, who controlled BHS from 2000 to 2015, also had a brilliant track record. And he ended up selling the business for Â£1. So what are the chances of saving BHS from the liquidators? And just who are the people aiming to do it? In the public eye, Greg Tufnell is easily overshadowed by his more famous brother Phil, the former England cricketer. But that could change if his bid for BHS is successful, because he hopes to become the firm's next chairman. And as far as his credentials for the job are concerned, the 54-year-old executive certainly talks the talk. He describes himself as ""a highly experienced managing director with Mothercare and Arcadia, a blend of entrepreneur, strategist and hands-on operator with significant commercial business turnaround, acquisition and fund-raising experience"". His record shows that he was buying and merchandising director at Next from 1991 to 1994. He then spent three years as managing director of menswear retailer Burton, part of the Arcadia group, followed by another three years as managing director of Mothercare. He currently appears to occupy a portfolio of different jobs, including the chairmanships of leather accessories brand Zatchels and recruitment consultancy hga Group. Earlier this month, he registered a new firm, Richess Group, at Companies House. Its other directors are Nick de Scossa, a Swiss banker, and Lisbon-based entrepreneur Jose Maria Soares Bento. Until Mr Tufnell's bid turned up, many observers had assumed that BHS would be snapped up by Matalan founder Mr Hargreaves. But it appears that the cost of a deal may have proved too high. Sources say Mr Hargreaves was asked to improve his offer and balked. Like Sir Philip Green, 71-year-old John Hargreaves also enjoys the life of the super-rich. He has an estimated fortune of Â£1bn, according to the Sunday Times Rich List.

The tree stump created a wall height similar to a ""modern bungalow"". ""They've draped probably animal skins or thatch around the basin and connected it to a post so it's a very comfortable snug little place,"" he said. The wooden wall of the hollow was lined with flints and the large earthy pit created by the tree root lined with cobbles and decorated with ""exotic"" stones from outside the area. ""There are some clever and sophisticated things going on, the hot stones that they put into this little type of alcove wouldn't have been on fire,"" explained Mr Jacques. ""It looks more like these people have been using these hot stones as a type of storage heater so that you've got a lot of warmth coming off them."" Mr Jacques will meet the UN experts later to ask for the route to be moved closer to Salisbury and for hydrological assessments to be made. ""It's very likely the water flow would be reduced in and around the site,"" he said. ""It would take out all the organics and destroy all the animal bone we've been finding which is crucial for finding where they have been living and for getting radiocarbon dates from all the organics like pollen and wood. ""This is massively important for reconstructing what the landscape would have looked like."" Andy Rhind-Tutt, former mayor and chairman of Amesbury Museum and Heritage Trust said: ""I sincerely hope the team delivering the long-awaited A303 improvement look seriously at an alternative alignment south of Salisbury and away from this unequalled archaeological landscape. ""It would be criminal to destroy such a rich heritage and connection with our ancestors for the sake of blocking the view to the passing public of Stonehenge.""",1,4,4
openai_text-davinci-002 (0 shot),The article discusses the discovery of a site that may be connected to Stonehenge and the potential damage that could be done to it by a road tunnel that is being planned.,"David Jacques, from the University of Buckingham, made the discovery at Blick Mead in October, and said the carbon dating results had just been confirmed. But he also raised concerns about possible damage to the site over plans to build a road tunnel past Stonehenge. The Department of Transport said it would ""consult before any building"". The Blick Mead site is about 1.5 miles (2.4km) from Stonehenge and archaeologists said ""scientifically tested charcoal"" dug up from the site had ""revealed that it dated from around 4000 BC"". David Jacques said the dig had also found ""evidence of feasting"" including burnt flints, tools and remains of giant cattle, known as aurochs, which were eaten by early hunter gatherers. Mr Jacques said: ""British pre-history may have to be rewritten. This is the latest dated Mesolithic encampment ever found in the UK. ""Blick Mead site connects the early hunter gatherer groups returning to Britain after the Ice Age to the Stonehenge area, all the way through to the Neolithic in the late 5th Millennium BC. ""But our only chance to find out about the earliest chapter of Britain's history could be wrecked if the tunnel goes ahead."" Andy Rhind-Tutt, a former mayor and current chairman of Amesbury Museum, which part-funded the dig, said the discovery could ""provide what archaeologists have been searching for centuries - the answer to the story of the pre-history of Stonehenge."" Earlier this month, the government announced funding for a 1.8-mile (2.9km) tunnel to remove congestion from the main road past Stonehenge. A Department for Transport spokesman said: ""As with any road scheme, we will consult with interested parties before any building begins on the A303. ""English Heritage and National Trust are supportive of our plans, and we will ensure sites of cultural or historical significance are safeguarded as we progress with the upgrade.""",1,5,5

It's full of light. It's busy. The building has regenerated the area around Melton Mowbray's railway station, once a muddy pot-holed piece of wasteland where those in the know parked for free. Now the council offices link the station to a park and the town centre. It was partly paid for with insurance money after a fire destroyed the old offices on the other side of town. A supermarket moved in to replace it and helped with the money too, putting the council on a firm financial footing. But that was four years ago and the crisis is a different one today. It's being experienced by all local authorities - cuts in central government funding which threaten the services they provide. Mr Rhodes is also deputy leader of Leicestershire County Council, with responsibility for finance. Leicestershire is historically the poorest funded council in the country because of a quirk of Whitehall recalculations, going back a quarter of a century since the poll tax, or community charge, was scrapped. At the moment councils get income from council tax, a share of the business rates, any income they generate themselves from services plus a grant from central government. It's the grant cut which is causing them grief. What's called the ""core funding"" is worked out by the number of homes multiplied by a set amount. And each authority has a different value set per dwelling. If we look at Surrey, which is top of the table, the amount will be £1,686 by 2019/20. Nottinghamshire is mid-table at £1,482, Derbyshire is in the lower reaches with £1,422 per dwelling and then comes Leicestershire at £1,354. ""The funding system is chaotic,"" says Byron Rhodes. ""It doesn't reflect real need. Look at Oxfordshire which is an interesting example,"" he says with a glint in his eye. Could he possibly be referring to the prime ministerial plea to the county council about cutbacks to services there? ""If we had the same funding as Oxfordshire, we'd have £50m a year extra. If we had the same as Surrey, we'd have £100m more. We'd be partying everyday if we had that kind of money."" Leicestershire have been helped with a small share of what's been called transitional funding - about £300m to help councils following pressure from Conservative MPs. Think back to the vote on Sunday trading. With a majority of only 17 in the Commons, the Conservatives lost the vote when 20 odd rebelled. Last month there would've been another rebellion, including some of our own Tory MPs in the East Midlands, if something wasn't done to improve the local government finance settlement over the next four years. The money has gone largely to shire counties. Leicestershire got £6.6m spread over two years, enough to save some services from closure. But it's a drop in the ocean for an authority with a £19m black hole in the budget every year after the latest cutbacks. Labour have protested that 83% of the councils getting transition funding are Conservative-run. Many Labour-run",1,5,4

openai_text-davinci-002 (0 shot),The article discusses the recent popularity of mead in the US and the challenges the industry faces in terms of awareness and image.,"But what's brewing in this new crop of commercial meaderies - as they are known - is lot more refined from the drink that once decorated tables across medieval Europe. ""Do we have any mead makers or home brewers in the group?"" asks Ben Alexander, eying a crowd of a dozen or so people who have come to his Maine Meade Works, in Portland, on a rainy Friday for a tour. When no-one raises their hand, Mr Alexander launches into the full spiel. ""If you guys want to come around, I'll show you how this thing works,"" he says, gesturing to two ceiling-high columns of stainless steel filled with something resembling a mushy golden porridge. ""We mix up honey and water over there and we pump it through a hot water bath at 160 degrees [71C] in a stainless steel coil here. Each one produces about 50 to 75 gallons [227-340 litres] of mead a day,"" explains Mr Alexander. It's fair to say he is obsessed with mead. ""It's the quintessential local beverage - you can go anywhere in the world and find honey to make mead, and I think that's unique among alcoholic beverages,"" he gushes. After being introduced to the drink by a home brewer, Mr Alexander thought there were profits to be had in a commercial meadery. He founded Maine Mead Works in 2008, pouring his savings and money from friends and family into the business. His business has since grown, along with the popularity of mead in the US. It's now a seven-person operation that manufactures more than 7,500 cases a year, shipping them as far away as China. Mr Alexander is not the only one to have caught on to the commercial potential of mead. Vicky Rowe, the owner of mead information website GotMead, says interest in the product in the US has exploded in the past decade. ""We went from 30-40 meaderies making mead to somewhere in the vicinity of 250 in the last 10 years,"" she says. ""I like to say that everything old is new again - people come back to what was good once."" Even visitors to Mr Alexander's meadery agree. Tour participant Dirk Heseman admitted that while Maine Mead Works was the first meadery he'd actually visited, he has noticed that mead ""is becoming more and more available - similar to cider"". Just this year, commercial meaderies in the US have banded together to form an industry group, the American Mead Makers Association, to better share information and encourage growth in the industry. But there's a lot of work that needs to be done to improve the image of a drink long associated with Renaissance fairs and medieval re-enactments. ""I think our number one challenge as an industry is awareness of what mead is,"" says Mr Alexander. ""You ask 10 people in a room if they've ever heard of mead, and two of them might say, 'yes', and only one of them has had a very positive experience."" The mead of the past was often sweet, and didn't appeal to many drinkers",1,5,5

The council's head of neighbourhood and strategic housing, Kristine Reeves, was later sacked over the affair. The development proposals, put forward by Norwich City Council, include 60 flats and 45 houses. The report to the council says 35 of the houses and flats will be for social rent. A report to Norwich City Council's planning committee, which meets on Thursday, advises councillors to approve the plans. Elderly residents were moved out of Greyhound Opening and nearby Goldsmith Street seven years ago after Norwich City Council agreed to redevelop the site. The council agreed that new employees relocating to the city could move in temporarily ahead of demolition. However other staff, including Ms Reeves, also moved in, in contravention of council policy. The council resisted calls for a full independent inquiry. Its own investigation found safeguards covering conflicts of interest were in place but not followed. In February 2009, London-based architects Riches Hawley Mikhail won a competition to design a new social housing development on the site, but they were never commissioned. During that year homes on the derelict site were demolished, but the site has since remained untouched.",1,4,4

State media picked up the story on Thursday, which was first reported in a local evening paper earlier this week. Liaoshen Wanbao reported the 49-year-old woman in Shenyang city had claimed her husband had divorced her 10 years ago because he disliked the shape of her face, said to be ""large and square"" with ""fat cheeks"". She said it spurred her to undergo facial surgery three times at a local hospital to shave her jawbones and reshape her face into a slimmer shape. During the third surgery the doctors discovered that if they proceeded further her nerves may be damaged, and halted the procedure. The woman, identified only by her surname Wang, later sued the hospital for 1.7 million yuan ($260,900; Â£183,900) in damages. She alleged the surgery had left her with soreness in her chin, and she could only eat and drink through a straw as ""when she exerted force on her lower jaw, she had the sensation that it would break"". The hospital, however, argued that the surgeries were conducted according to regulations, and pointed out that they encouraged her to seek psychiatric help instead of a third operation, which she refused. After mediation the woman agreed to accept 20,000 yuan ($3,100, Â£2,200) as compensation, said the report. On Weibo, some condemned the woman's husband, but others also chastised the woman. One top-voted comment read: ""It's purely an excuse, if her face was large then why did he decide to marry her in the first place? If he stopped loving her then he should have just said so."" It continued: ""This woman is also very silly to have believed that her face shape was the real reason for the divorce, she is lying to herself."" Said another Weibo user: ""Even if you had gone for facial surgery and made your face smaller, he would still have found other reasons to divorce you."" One person noted the sharp difference in the compensation amount and voiced suspicions: ""1.7 million was dropped to 20,000, it makes me wonder if she really did have a problem with her jaw."" Still others took the opportunity to crack jokes. ""What an odd reason for divorce! I wonder how square was this woman's square-shaped face? Like a television set? Microwave oven?"" Plastic surgery has long been a hot topic on Weibo. In December, users similarly expressed outrage when a Chinese man took out a newspaper advertisement pleading for his wife to go for plastic surgery.

But despite the church's best efforts the bats are not moving and are soiling the altar and church furniture, leaving the church with an ""appalling smell"". The creatures are protected by law and cannot be wilfully disturbed. Volunteers at the church have been working for the past decade to keep the altar, stonework and woodwork clean. But the bats, roosting in the higher areas of the church continually soil the interior of the building with urine and faeces. Church warden Liz Cowley said keeping the 11th Century building in good shape was difficult. She said: ""You can see the urine marks (on the altar), they won't go away. ""If people were coming in here damaging an ancient building like this, you would say it was criminal damage. ""The smell is appalling, it's a combination of ammonia from the urine and a musty smell from the droppings that catches at the back of the throat."" Members of the church had spent Â£10,000 trying to get the bats to move and had paid for specially-built lofts nearby. The Rev Paul Mothersdale, the Rector of St Hilda's Church, said a lot of money had been invested in trying to persuade the bats to move out of the church. The Rev Mothersdale said: ""We've tried to do everything that English Nature, or Natural England, have wanted us to do.

Ms Bellini said: ""It is a really regionally important roost.

Election officials have urged patience. Uhuru Kenyatta, who faces trial at the International Criminal Court, has been leading in early presidential results declared from Monday's tightly contested election. He is due to stand trial at The Hague next month for allegedly fuelling violence after the disputed 2007 election. He denies the charge. His closest rival is outgoing Prime Minister Raila Odinga. With provisional results in from more than 40% of polling stations earlier on Wednesday, Mr Odinga had 42% of the vote compared with Mr Kenyatta's 53%. However, Mr Odinga's allies remain confident that he will gain ground as results from his strongholds, including the Coast Province, are declared. More than 1,000 people were killed in the violence which broke out in 2007-08 after Mr Odinga claimed he had been cheated of victory by supporters of President Mwai Kibaki, who is stepping down after two terms in office. The BBC's Solomon Mugera in the capital, Nairobi, says Kenyans are becoming increasingly anxious about the delay in finalising the results. Some businesses and schools across the country have remained shut since Monday's election, he says.

One signatory, Jenny Lewis, wrote on the first petition: ""[Tutors] Helen Kidd and Tom Sherry are carrying on the great Ruskin tradition of bringing opportunities to those that otherwise would not have them."" Student and activist Saskia Ritchie, who set up the second petition, said Ruskin had been set up for ""people who would traditionally be excluded from academia"" and gives ""access to truly excellent learning opportunities"". Mr Wilkes said the college would lose about 25 students as a result of the cuts. He added degrees had been on offer at the college for about 10 years and were ""relatively new"" considering the college's 116-year history.

openai_text-davinci-002 (0 shot),The group of British citizens was detained by Turkish authorities while attempting to travel to an area controlled by Islamic State militants.,"The group, reported to be three men, two women and four children aged from two to 11, was held at Reyhanli, in Hatay province, near the Syrian border. Their intention in travelling to the region, where areas are controlled by Islamic State (IS) militants or an al-Qaeda affiliate, is not clear. The Foreign Office has said it is in contact with the Turkish authorities. The BBC's Mark Lowen said the information about the ages of the children had not been independently verified and it was too early to know where the group were intending to head to. ""Were they heading for one of the more moderate groups in Syria. Were they heading for the area controlled by al-Nusra, the al-Qaeda affiliate? Or were they heading to so-called Islamic State territory?"" he said. The group was taken to a police station in southern Turkey overnight, and then sent to the foreigners department awaiting deportation to the UK. They have undergone medical examinations and had their finger-prints taken. The United Nations estimates the number of foreign fighters joining militant groups is more than 25,000, from 100 different nations. About 600 Britons are believed to have gone to Syria or Iraq since IS seized control of large swathes of territory there. Most are thought to have volunteered as fighters for the militant Islamist group. Around half are believed to have later returned to the UK, the Metropolitan Police has said. The latest detentions come two weeks after three British teenagers were stopped from travelling into Syria from Turkey. The three - two aged 17 and one 19, from north-west London - were arrested following a tip-off from British police and flown back to the UK. They have since been released on police bail. They had flown to Turkey from Barcelona and were arrested at Sabiha Gokcen airport in Istanbul. Fadi Hakura, Turkey analyst for Chatham House, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the recent arrests showed the Turkish government was ""taking more effective measures to control the flow of fighters and supporters into Syria"". He said there was now ""more enhanced security and intelligence cooperation between Turkey and its Western counterparts, especially with the exchange of names that Turkey needs to prohibit [IS supporters] from crossing into Syria"". The Turkish government has said it cannot make a 560-mile border watertight and will act when it has prior warning. In February this year there were recriminations between British police and Turkish officials after three London schoolgirls disappeared from Turkey, apparently having crossed the border into Syria. Shamima Begum, Amira Abase, both 15, and Kadiza Sultana, 16 had flown to Istanbul and travelled to the border region.

Political leaders, businesses, sporting organisations, and charities will meet at Lancaster House on Thursday. Mr Cameron says corruption is ""the root of so many of the world's problems"". He also described it as ""an enemy of progress"". ""It destroys jobs and holds back economic growth, traps the poorest in desperate poverty, and undermines our security by pushing people towards extremist groups,"" he added. ""The battle against corruption will not be won overnight. It will take time, courage and determination to deliver the reforms that are necessary. But we cannot hope to solve the major global challenges we face without tackling the exploitation, fraud and dishonesty at their heart. ""For too long there has been a taboo about tackling this issue head-on. The summit will change that. Together we will push the fight against corruption to the top of the international agenda where it belongs."" Among the world leaders attending the summit are presidents Ashraf Ghani of Afghanistan, Juan Manuel Santos of Colombia and Muhammadu Buhari of Nigeria, and Norwegian prime minister Erna Solberg. Russia is to be represented by deputy foreign minister Oleg Syromolotov. Panellists are expected to include World Bank president Jim Yong Kim and International Monetary Fund's managing director Christine Lagarde. Under the prime minister's plans, leaders at the summit would pledge to expose corruption and pursue and punish those who perpetrate, facilitate or are complicit in it. Campaigners have also called for a crackdown on tax havens linked to the United Kingdom. The recent Panama Papers leak showed how some wealthy people use offshore firms to evade tax and avoid sanctions. A Downing Street spokesman said: ""We are in discussions with the Overseas Territories and Crown dependencies with major financial centres about their attendance, and expect a number to join the summit."" Robert Barrington, of anti-corruption campaigners Transparency International, said: ""The prime minister is creating a platform for governments that are serious about fighting corruption to make really significant changes and set the agenda for a generation to come. ""What is key now is that other governments are persuaded to sign up to ambitious targets and that the UK government does not give in to the usual last minute attempts by less committed countries to water down the summit's ambitions"".",1,4,4

He admitted culpable homicide on the basis of diminished responsibility after saying he had no recollection of the killing at Dixon Avenue, Glasgow, on 24 September last year. Buksh will be sentenced on 27 June. The High Court in Glasgow heard that 43-year-old Mrs Buksh died after being struck on the head at least five times. Pathologists told the court that the lack of defensive injuries and the position of her body suggested she was assaulted as she slept. Following the attack, Buksh went to Cathcart Police Station and told an officer: ""I've come to hand myself in. I think my wife's dead. I hit her on the head. I did it."" The court was told that three psychiatrists described Buksh as suffering from an acute stress disorder at the time. Prosecutor Gordon Lamont said: ""The accused and his wife had been married for 25 years, but over the last 10 or 11 years their relationship appears to have broken down and they became increasingly estranged, albeit, still residing under the one roof. ""They slept separately and Mrs Buksh routinely slept on the sofa in the living room. Their children report that they barely spoke to each other."" Mr Lamont said the problems in the marriage intensified after Mrs Buksh went to Pakistan on holiday in May last year. He said she had become involved with another man and was making plans to move to Pakistan. The court also heard that two days before he killed his wife, Buksh went to Paisley Police Office and spoke with a support officer saying he feared his wife was going to take their youngest child, aged 10, to Pakistan and not return. He also made an emergency doctor's appointment and said he was suffering from stress and not sleeping. He was prescribed medication for stress. Defence counsel Sarah Livingstone said: ""My client has no memory of this incident. His amnesia is absolutely genuine. ""This is not a case where this man was a bad husband, there was no domestic abuse. This was an unhappy marriage, but however, unhappy it was it didn't justify killing his wife. ""He suffered an acute stress reaction. Three psychiatrists all agree that he was suffering from an abnormality of the mind.""

Internet companies will also be required to allow Russian authorities access to users' information. One human rights group called the move ""draconian"". The law was approved by Russia's upper house of parliament in April. It includes measures to ensure that bloggers cannot remain anonymous, and states that social networks must maintain six months of data on its users. The information must be stored on servers based in Russian territory, so that government authorities can gain access. Critics see it as the latest in a series of recent moves to curb internet freedom. Hugh Williamson, of New York-based Human Rights Watch, has called the law ""another milestone in Russia's relentless crackdown on free expression"". ""The internet is the last island of free expression in Russia and these draconian regulations are clearly aimed at putting it under government control,"" he added. Opposition figures have used the internet to air their views, with some gaining millions of followers. Commentators opposing Vladimir Putin often face restrictions in broadcast outlets and newspapers. Analysis: Famil Ismailov, news editor, BBCRussian.com Russian bloggers are bracing themselves for the moment when Russia's new ""information security law"" comes into force on 1 August. Some already share advice on how to use proxy servers in order to access social media sites that, in their view, are under threat of being closed. It is hard to see how the law will be enforced. The servers for most of the popular social media platforms that many Russians use are based outside Russia. Many popular bloggers are already looking for, and apparently finding, ways to ""cheat"" the feature that counts page visits and keep their daily unique visitor numbers just under 3000, or to make sure that the statistics are hidden altogether. Anton Nossik, who is considered Russia's ""internet guru"", wrote in his LiveJournal blog that the new law didn't threaten individual bloggers directly, but provided legal grounds to block popular social networks like Facebook, Twitter, LiveJournal and Google. ""The issue of banning all these platforms in Russia is a political one and it will be decided by only one person"", Mr Nossik wrote, with a thinly veiled reference to President Vladimir Putin. Earlier in the year, Russia enacted a law that gave the government powers to block websites without explanation. In March, Moscow blocked the blog of Mr Navalny, along with two news sites and a organisation run by Garry Kasparov - a vocal critic of the Russian government. In a statement, Russia's prosecutor general's office said the blocks were imposed because of the sites' role in helping stage illegal protests. Earlier this week, Twitter blocked access to an anti-Kremlin account that often publishes leaked government documents, following a request by Russia's federal communications agency Roskomnadzor. For many years, Russia had relatively lax internet laws. However Moscow has recently changed its tune, with Mr Putin branding the internet an ongoing ""CIA project"". He also claimed that",1,4,4

I got it like other people on our network. The buzz around it was then created on different social media websites and with videos. I was here on 25 January when riot police forced us out and by the 28th, we were back following the violence. I've been sleeping here most of the time since. Our social network was established in 2005, when there was a democratic opening around the time of the presidential elections. People from different backgrounds all met through blogging and hoped to use technology for social change. It meant we have all gained good contacts, experience and strong networks. I like to think the social network is the people itself. Things like Facebook, Twitter, SMS and phones are just social tools. When they blocked Facebook and shut down technology, our network still operated because it's about people. Internet activists are also people and a lot of our organising, social work and relationships are developed offline. This is something that people dreamt of but didn't anticipate happening in reality. If anything, it shows that all the effort we put in over the past few years has not been wasted. It has climaxed into this critical mass of people you see in the square. At the moment I'm not getting a lot of internet connection. I'm trying not to drain my phone battery. We're still using it to distribute footage people are bringing to us that we've sorted through. I hope the internet will continue to play a complementary role in activism. At the moment we physically exist in downtown Cairo and I hope that when we have finished this sit-in, we will have won the right to organise ourselves outside the internet. Twitter: Amr Gharbeia I was involved in this revolution from the first day, 25 January, and I've now been spending my nights here for a while. For the past five years, I was very active online, blogging and tweeting. As we live under emergency laws in Egypt it has been very difficult to meet or communicate except on the internet. I'd never been part of a demonstration on the ground. At first we were mocking the event on 25 January. We questioned whether it was really possible to have a ""Facebook revolution"". I came on the 25th because I felt it was my duty as a citizen and I couldn't believe how it turned into something so different from what we've seen before. I was walking among the people and weeping. Now I sometimes just tweet to update people about what's going on or to call for a million-man demonstration or a day to remember our martyrs. I'm well-known among bloggers for my long articles and constant tweets, but once I was here I stopped communicating this way so much. I felt it was totally different to have real freedom rather than just hypothetical freedom or internet freedom. Blogging and tweeting has been important as we were building our minds.

State media picked up the story on Thursday, which was first reported in a local evening paper earlier this week. Liaoshen Wanbao reported the 49-year-old woman in Shenyang city had claimed her husband had divorced her 10 years ago because he disliked the shape of her face, said to be ""large and square"" with ""fat cheeks"". She said it spurred her to undergo facial surgery three times at a local hospital to shave her jawbones and reshape her face into a slimmer shape. During the third surgery the doctors discovered that if they proceeded further her nerves may be damaged, and halted the procedure. The woman, identified only by her surname Wang, later sued the hospital for 1.7 million yuan ($260,900; Â£183,900) in damages. She alleged the surgery had left her with soreness in her chin, and she could only eat and drink through a straw as ""when she exerted force on her lower jaw, she had the sensation that it would break"". The hospital, however, argued that the surgeries were conducted according to regulations, and pointed out that they encouraged her to seek psychiatric help instead of a third operation, which she refused. After mediation the woman agreed to accept 20,000 yuan ($3,100, Â£2,200) as compensation, said the report. On Weibo, some condemned the woman's husband, but others also chastised the woman. One top-voted comment read: ""It's purely an excuse, if her face was large then why did he decide to marry her in the first place? If he stopped loving her then he should have just said so."" It continued: ""This woman is also very silly to have believed that her face shape was the real reason for the divorce, she is lying to herself."" Said another Weibo user: ""Even if you had gone for facial surgery and made your face smaller, he would still have found other reasons to divorce you."" One person noted the sharp difference in the compensation amount and voiced suspicions: ""1.7 million was dropped to 20,000, it makes me wonder if she really did have a problem with her jaw."" Still others took the opportunity to crack jokes. ""What an odd reason for divorce! I wonder how square was this woman's square-shaped face? Like a television set? Microwave oven?"" Plastic surgery has long been a hot topic on Weibo. In December, users similarly expressed outrage when a Chinese man took out a newspaper advertisement pleading for his wife to go for plastic surgery.

A ""pre-action protocol letter"" from the council's legal department to Ms Teal warned the authority will seek a High Court injunction to stop her, and others involved in ""direct action"", from taking part in future protests. The council said the process would give protesters ""a chance to further and finally consider their position"" before it begins legal proceedings on 12 July. Councillor Bryan Lodge, cabinet member for Environment and Street Scene, said there had been months of ""unlawful and costly disruption"" to tree replacement works in Sheffield by a small number of protesters. ""We continue to support the right to peacefully protest, and the majority of protesters who are doing so peacefully will not be affected,"" he added. ""But there is a big difference between this and direct action which deliberately and unlawfully stops works from being carried out."" Mr Lodge said protesters had been sent a letter several weeks ago confirming their actions were unlawful. ""Streets Ahead is not just about street trees, it's about ensuring we have roads, pavements and a street scene to be proud of for many years to come,"" he added. ""In addition, it presents us with a unique opportunity to sustainably manage, increase and maintain our diverse street tree stock over a 25 year period."" The council said, despite the letter, works were still being disrupted ""causing city-wide delays"".",1,5,5
pegasus,A cat who has been stealing from his owner's house for the last two years has started bringing home toys.,"Kleptomaniac Theo, from Ipswich, first hit the headlines in 2013 for stealing Christmas decorations. Recently he has been stealing toy food, including a pineapple and an aubergine. ""We are deeply ashamed of our cat, especially as he had convinced us that he had changed his criminal ways,"" his owner wrote to neighbours. Rachael Drouet created a leaflet for her neighbours in a bid to reunite the stolen items with their rightful owners. ""This year has been relatively quiet, save for some Bettaware catalogues and the odd flat balloon,"" the leaflet read. ""Until a few days ago when he started bring home toy food. ""So far we have cheese, a green pepper, fish, a pineapple, an aubergine, and a felt basket to put them all in."" Theo, a five-year-old Siamese cross, also managed to bring home a child's body warmer. Earlier this year, he stole a catalogue from a house down the street owned by a policeman, which Ms Drouet said ""wasn't ideal"". Among the items stolen in the last couple of years are muslin cloths, fluffy pens, a USB phone charger cable and a child's piece of art. Theo also took to stealing Christmas decorations from neighbours' trees. Ms Drouet said this year she managed to reunite items from Theo's haul with their rightful owners before too long. ""I wrote the flyers and then luckily managed to find out who all the things belonged to,"" Ms Drouet said. ""You get tired of knocking on neighbours' doors and saying 'me again'"".",0,5,4

pegasus,A deputy head teacher at a school at the centre of the Trojan Horse affair has been cleared of misconduct.,"Asif Kahn, who worked at Oldknow Academy in Birmingham, had faced allegations of misconduct. A National College of Teaching and Leadership panel heard the allegations against him in November, although Mr Khan did not appear at the hearing. The Professional Conduct Panel has said it did not find the case proven. Oldknow Academy was one of several schools investigated amid claims of a Muslim hardliners' plot to control them; known as the Trojan Horse affair. More on this and other stories from Birmingham and the Black Country Mr Khan had been accused of agreeing ""to the inclusion of an undue amount of religious influence in the education of pupils"" at Oldknow, on or before 31 July 2014. The accusations had included telling some male pupils to change for PE in a cupboard so they would not show their thighs, banning children singing during a production of The Wizard of Oz and turning his back on a woman as she offered to shake his hand. He was also accused of sharing his personal beliefs with the children, for example telling the children they were not allowed pet dogs as they were Muslim.

pegasus,A firefighter has been sacked for failing to attend a house fire in which an elderly woman died.,"The man, who has not been named, was dismissed following disciplinary proceedings, Devon and Somerset Fire Service said. Molly Wigmore, 76, died in the fire at her Plymouth home in October last year. The first 999 call was made at 05:17 GMT but none had arrived by the time a second call was made at 06:44, ahead of a fire engine arriving at 06:50. Ms Wigmore's house, in Sussex Road, is about a mile and a half from Camels Head Fire Station. An inquest is expected to examine whether the delay played any part in her death, on 19 October. The fire service said in a statement it was unable to comment on the case until the inquest was over. ""We continue to offer the family of the deceased our deepest condolences,"" the service added. Tributes left at the house said Ms Wigmore was an ""inspirational, kind, gentle and sweet lady"".",1,5,5
pegasus,A fountain in a Hertfordshire town is to be refilled to celebrate the Queen's Diamond Jubilee and the Olympic Games.,"The Coronation Fountain, a landmark in Welwyn Garden City, had to be turned off due to the hosepipe ban. However, the council is now paying Â£450 to fill it up again, so that the town looks its best for key 2012 events. It will be working on the 4 and 5 June and when the Olympic torch relay passes through the borough on 8 July. The fountain on Parkway in the town was built to celebrate the Queen's accession to the throne in 1952. It is supplied by an underground tank, but had to be switched off after the water level dropped and could not be refilled. The council is buying water from a landscaping firm which already supplies water from a natural lake source, to maintain the borough's open spaces. It cannot be drunk so is permitted under the hosepipe ban regulations. Council chief executive, Michel Saminaden, said: ""They have told us that there is an abundance of water in this lake so we are probably doing them a favour by taking it."" Mr Saminaden added that the council decided against asking the Veolia water company for a special dispensation. ""I thought that wasn't the right thing to do because we would be using precious water,"" he said. ""What we are doing now is using water that is surplus and we have been told categorically that there is no problem in using it. This is a better all round sustainable solution. ""I am extremely pleased that we have been able to find a solution which will enable everybody to see the fountain in all its glory on the occasion of these two great celebrations.""",1,5,4

pegasus,A man has admitted killing his estranged wife at their home in Glasgow.,"Asghar Buksh, 55, repeatedly struck mother-of-six Nasreen Buksh over the head with a heavy blunt object which has never been found. He admitted culpable homicide on the basis of diminished responsibility after saying he had no recollection of the killing at Dixon Avenue, Glasgow, on 24 September last year. Buksh will be sentenced on 27 June. The High Court in Glasgow heard that 43-year-old Mrs Buksh died after being struck on the head at least five times. Pathologists told the court that the lack of defensive injuries and the position of her body suggested she was assaulted as she slept. Following the attack, Buksh went to Cathcart Police Station and told an officer: ""I've come to hand myself in. I think my wife's dead. I hit her on the head. I did it."" The court was told that three psychiatrists described Buksh as suffering from an acute stress disorder at the time. Prosecutor Gordon Lamont said: ""The accused and his wife had been married for 25 years, but over the last 10 or 11 years their relationship appears to have broken down and they became increasingly estranged, albeit, still residing under the one roof. ""They slept separately and Mrs Buksh routinely slept on the sofa in the living room. Their children report that they barely spoke to each other."" Mr Lamont said the problems in the marriage intensified after Mrs Buksh went to Pakistan on holiday in May last year. He said she had become involved with another man and was making plans to move to Pakistan. The court also heard that two days before he killed his wife, Buksh went to Paisley Police Office and spoke with a support officer saying he feared his wife was going to take their youngest child, aged 10, to Pakistan and not return. He also made an emergency doctor's appointment and said he was suffering from stress and not sleeping. He was prescribed medication for stress. Defence counsel Sarah Livingstone said: ""My client has no memory of this incident. His amnesia is absolutely genuine. ""This is not a case where this man was a bad husband, there was no domestic abuse. This was an unhappy marriage, but however, unhappy it was it didn't justify killing his wife. ""He suffered an acute stress reaction. Three psychiatrists all agree that he was suffering from an abnormality of the mind."" Judge Lord Burns deferred sentence on Buksh until 27 June at the High Court in Edinburgh for background reports.",1,5,5

Anton Nossik, who is considered Russia's ""internet guru"", wrote in his LiveJournal blog that the new law didn't threaten individual bloggers directly, but provided legal grounds to block popular social networks like Facebook, Twitter, LiveJournal","It means bloggers with more than 3,000 daily readers must register with the mass media regulator, Roskomnadzor, and conform to the regulations that govern the country's larger media outlets. Internet companies will also be required to allow Russian authorities access to users' information. One human rights group called the move ""draconian"". The law was approved by Russia's upper house of parliament in April. It includes measures to ensure that bloggers cannot remain anonymous, and states that social networks must maintain six months of data on its users. The information must be stored on servers based in Russian territory, so that government authorities can gain access. Critics see it as the latest in a series of recent moves to curb internet freedom. Hugh Williamson, of New York-based Human Rights Watch, has called the law ""another milestone in Russia's relentless crackdown on free expression"". ""The internet is the last island of free expression in Russia and these draconian regulations are clearly aimed at putting it under government control,"" he added. Opposition figures have used the internet to air their views, with some gaining millions of followers. Commentators opposing Vladimir Putin often face restrictions in broadcast outlets and newspapers. Analysis: Famil Ismailov, news editor, BBCRussian.com Russian bloggers are bracing themselves for the moment when Russia's new ""information security law"" comes into force on 1 August. Some already share advice on how to use proxy servers in order to access social media sites that, in their view, are under threat of being closed. It is hard to see how the law will be enforced. The servers for most of the popular social media platforms that many Russians use are based outside Russia. Many popular bloggers are already looking for, and apparently finding, ways to ""cheat"" the feature that counts page visits and keep their daily unique visitor numbers just under 3000, or to make sure that the statistics are hidden altogether. Anton Nossik, who is considered Russia's ""internet guru"", wrote in his LiveJournal blog that the new law didn't threaten individual bloggers directly, but provided legal grounds to block popular social networks like Facebook, Twitter, LiveJournal and Google. ""The issue of banning all these platforms in Russia is a political one and it will be decided by only one person"", Mr Nossik wrote, with a thinly veiled reference to President Vladimir Putin. Earlier in the year, Russia enacted a law that gave the government powers to block websites without explanation. In March, Moscow blocked the blog of Mr Navalny, along with two news sites and a organisation run by Garry Kasparov - a vocal critic of the Russian government. In a statement, Russia's prosecutor general's office said the blocks were imposed because of the sites' role in helping stage illegal protests. Earlier this week, Twitter blocked access to an anti-Kremlin account that often publishes leaked government documents, following a request by Russia's federal communications agency Roskomnadzor. For many years, Russia had relatively lax internet laws. However Moscow has recently changed its tune, with Mr Putin branding the internet an ongoing ""CIA project"". He also claimed that",1,5,4

pegasus,A prison officer who was injured in a dissident republican bomb attack has died in hospital.,"Adrian Ismay, 52, was seriously hurt after a booby-trap device exploded under his van in Belfast on 4 March. The police said that a post-mortem examination showed he died as a ""direct result of the injuries"" of the bomb. A dissident republican group, widely referred to as the new IRA, said it carried out the attack. The organisation said Mr Ismay was targeted for training officers at Maghaberry Prison near Lisburn, County Antrim. Sue McAllister, director general of the Northern Ireland Prison Service, spent time with the Ismay family on Wednesday. She said they were ""devastated and beyond shock at what's happened"". ""Like all of us, they thought that he was on the mend and was doing really well,"" said Mrs McAllister. ""We thought he would make a full recovery, we expected him to come back to work in due course, so we're all shocked, but particularly Sharon and her daughters."" Mrs McAllister condemned the behaviour of some paramilitary inmates at Maghaberry Prison, who reportedly cheered, smoked cigars and mocked wardens at the high-security jail when news of Mr Ismay's death filtered through. ""This was just unacceptable behaviour by a very small number of prisoners,"" said Mrs McAllister. ""My colleagues in Maghaberry dealt with it professionally, with great fortitude and with the courage they display on a daily basis."" She admitted she and her colleagues in the Prison Service felt ""very angry"" on hearing the reports of the celebrations in the exercise yard of the prison. ""We encounter challenging behaviour by a small number of prisoners every day, and we deal with it with great professionalism and we do not stoop to behaving that way in response,"" she added.

The City Deal scheme will see eight council areas around Glasgow receive about £1bn from the UK and Scottish governments. The councils also have the power to borrow extra cash. The Glasgow and Clyde Valley City Deal involved massive investment by both the Scottish and UK governments last year. Eight councils - Glasgow, East Renfrewshire, Renfrewshire, Inverclyde, North and South Lanarkshire and East and West Dunbartonshire - are involved. The City Deal scheme will see Westminster and Holyrood give £500m each in additional grant funding to the eight council areas. The councils will supplement this by borrowing £130m. Councillors from across all eight areas will meet to discuss some of the schemes. Several of the projects being discussed later are in East Renfrewshire, where £44m is expected to be invested over the next few years, with much of the money coming from the City Deal funding. One is a water sports park at the Dams to Darnley Country Park. It would open in 2017 and include a centre offering wakeboarding, the fastest-growing extreme sport in the world. A new railway station in Barrhead and sliproad from the M77 would serve an area which could become one of East Renfrewshire's fastest growth areas. The council expects 1,000 new homes to be built there. Another project would transform the Levern Works site in Barrhead. A site formerly occupied by Nestle, where pet food was once made, would be cleared. The site will then be marketed for development for a range of uses that will bring new jobs to Barrhead. A wide range of other infrastructure projects across the eight council areas will also be discussed.",1,5,4

Last month, the Supreme Court ruled that the anthem must be played in every cinema before a film is screened. Some 20 people have been held in Kerala and Tamil Nadu since then for remaining seated during the anthem. Also, India's colonial-era sedition law has been often used against students, journalists, writers and social activists and those critical of the government. Reports said that the BJP's youth wing lodged a complaint against a Facebook post by Mr Chavara which allegedly insulted the anthem. The post was apparently an excerpt from one of his books. Senior police official Sateesh Bino told the NDTV news channel that the writer-activist ""is being questioned for his controversial post on the national anthem on Facebook"" and had been charged with sedition. Earlier this month, 12 people were arrested at a cinema in Kerala, after they remained seated while the national anthem played. The cinemagoers, who were attending an international film festival, were later freed but they face charges of ""failure to obey an order issued by a public servant, thereby causing obstruction or annoyance to others"". And at a cinema in Chennai, eight people who did not stand for the anthem were assaulted and abused, police said. The eight were later charged with showing disrespect to the anthem.",1,5,5
pegasus,"Activity in the UK's manufacturing sector fell to a three-year low in April, according to a closely watched survey.","The Markit/CIPS manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index fell to 49.2 from 50.7 in March. A reading below 50 indicates falling output. It is the first time that activity in the sector has fallen since March 2013. Firms blamed soft domestic demand, a fall in new business from overseas and uncertainty ahead of the EU referendum. A slowdown in the oil and gas industry, a major customer for UK companies, is also hitting production. The index for new orders fell to 50.4 in April, from 51.9 the month before, matching February's three-year low. Rob Dobson, senior economist at Markit, said: ""On this evidence manufacturing production is now falling at a quarterly pace of around 1%, and will likely act as a drag on the economy again during the second quarter and putting greater pressure on the service sector to sustain GDP growth. ""The manufacturing labour market is also being impacted, with the data signalling close to 20,000 job losses over the past three months."" Last week, official figures showed UK economic growth slowed to 0.4% in the first quarter of the year from 0.6% in late 2015, propped up by the services sector. David Noble, group chief executive at the Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply (CIPS), said: ""Recent fears over a stall in the UK's manufacturing sector have now become a reality. ""An atmosphere of deep unease is building throughout the manufacturing supply chain, eating away at new orders, reducing British exports and putting more jobs at risk. ""A sense of apprehension across the sector is being caused by enduring volatility in the oil and gas industry, falling retailer confidence and the uncertainty created by the EU referendum."" The Markit/CIPS survey found new export orders contracted for the fourth straight month in April as the global economy continued to slow. A measure of employment in the manufacturing sector was also below the 50 mark for its fourth straight month. Lee Hopley, chief economist at the manufacturers' organisation, EEF, said: ""The sharp drop to a three-year low and another month of reported job cuts could be the clearest sign yet that referendum uncertainty is starting to weigh on the real economy. ""However, this is just another straw on the back of a sector already grappling with the struggling oil and gas sector, softening domestic demand and weak order outlook from other parts of the world, all of which are failing to provide any counterbalance to the political uncertainty at home.""",1,5,4

The buzz around it was then created on different social media websites and with videos. I was here on 25 January when riot police forced us out and by the 28th, we were back following the violence. I've been sleeping here most of the time since. Our social network was established in 2005, when there was a democratic opening around the time of the presidential elections. People from different backgrounds all met through blogging and hoped to use technology for social change. It meant we have all gained good contacts, experience and strong networks. I like to think the social network is the people itself. Things like Facebook, Twitter, SMS and phones are just social tools. When they blocked Facebook and shut down technology, our network still operated because it's about people. Internet activists are also people and a lot of our organising, social work and relationships are developed offline. This is something that people dreamt of but didn't anticipate happening in reality. If anything, it shows that all the effort we put in over the past few years has not been wasted. It has climaxed into this critical mass of people you see in the square. At the moment I'm not getting a lot of internet connection. I'm trying not to drain my phone battery. We're still using it to distribute footage people are bringing to us that we've sorted through. I hope the internet will continue to play a complementary role in activism. At the moment we physically exist in downtown Cairo and I hope that when we have finished this sit-in, we will have won the right to organise ourselves outside the internet. Twitter: Amr Gharbeia I was involved in this revolution from the first day, 25 January, and I've now been spending my nights here for a while. For the past five years, I was very active online, blogging and tweeting. As we live under emergency laws in Egypt it has been very difficult to meet or communicate except on the internet. I'd never been part of a demonstration on the ground. At first we were mocking the event on 25 January. We questioned whether it was really possible to have a ""Facebook revolution"". I came on the 25th because I felt it was my duty as a citizen and I couldn't believe how it turned into something so different from what we've seen before. I was walking among the people and weeping. Now I sometimes just tweet to update people about what's going on or to call for a million-man demonstration or a day to remember our martyrs. I'm well-known among bloggers for my long articles and constant tweets, but once I was here I stopped communicating this way so much. I felt it was totally different to have real freedom rather than just hypothetical freedom or internet freedom. Blogging and tweeting has been important as we were building our minds.

Arcade Fire took to the stage shortly after 22:00 BST, their arrival heralded by a man dressed from head-to-toe in a mirrored suit.","Aided by dancers, confetti cannons and a man in a mirrored suit, the Canadian band revived revellers' spirits with a series of arms-aloft anthems. ""In a lifetime of pretty much impossible things that have happened to our band, this is the highlight,"" said frontman Win Butler. Earlier, every stage at the event was closed after lightning struck ground. Dance act Rudimental were escorted off the main stage mid-set, and had to abandon their planned encore - Feel The Love, with guest vocalist John Newman. ""We're quite upset,"" musician Amir Amor told the BBC, ""but we had a great time anyway"". Metallica's Lars Ulrich was flying into the site by helicopter as the storm descended. ""It was kind of frightening,"" he said. ""When we landed, all the people picking us up were going, 'we didn't expect you were going to fly in this weather'. ""But the pilot didn't say anything about that. We saw the lightning up there. I thought it was pyrotechnics for Arcade Fire."" The thunderstorm heralded a brief but torrential downpour, and the power cut took BBC coverage off the air. Music resumed on the main stage at 19:00 BST with Lily Allen, who dedicated an expletive-laden song to FIFA president Sepp Blatter. Other performers on Friday included Blondie, who proved so popular it became impossible to enter or leave The Other Stage at lunchtime, and Paolo Nutini, whose soulful ballads were a fitting soundtrack as dusk fell over Somerset. Sophie Ellis-Bextor sneaked some disco into her set at the largely-acoustic Avalon Stage, while the pulsing synthpop of Glaswegian band Chvrches made for a steamy atmosphere in the John Peel tent as fans danced off the downpour. Arcade Fire took to the stage shortly after 22:00 BST, their arrival heralded by a man dressed from head-to-toe in a mirrored suit. Bravely, considering the weather conditions, the 12-piece band were largely dressed in white, but if they were worried about laundry bills, it didn't show. They threw themselves around the stage, thrashing and spinning as though plagued by a swarm of invisible bees, each member switching instruments between - and often during - songs. As well as guitars, they played steel drums, xylophones and even a hurdy gurdy. Frontman Win Butler made frequent excursions into the audience and, during the song Flashbulb Eyes, plucked a camera from a press photographer and carried it on stage to capture the band's performance. The set list was evenly spread across their four albums, with highlights including No Cars Go, Neighborhood #1 (Tunnels) and Rebellion (Lies). The group's recurring subject matter of suburban despair and alienation might have seemed like an odd fit for Glastonbury's peace and love ethos, but there is an optimism and belief in humanity at the core of their music. Plus, they have really catchy choruses.

Archaeologist David Jacques, said: ""They... used the stump of the tree, about three metres high, as a wall."" The finds are being shown to United Nations heritage experts, who are currently visiting Stonehenge. Archaeologists are concerned a planned 2.9km tunnel being considered for the nearby A303 main road will damage the site. Discoveries have also shown stones were warmed up by the Mesolithic Period inhabitants and used in a hearth to emit heat in the earthy snug. Mr Jacques, a senior research fellow at the University of Buckingham, has worked at Blick Mead for over a decade, making a number of discoveries about the inhabitants. The tree stump created a wall height similar to a ""modern bungalow"". ""They've draped probably animal skins or thatch around the basin and connected it to a post so it's a very comfortable snug little place,"" he said. The wooden wall of the hollow was lined with flints and the large earthy pit created by the tree root lined with cobbles and decorated with ""exotic"" stones from outside the area. ""There are some clever and sophisticated things going on, the hot stones that they put into this little type of alcove wouldn't have been on fire,"" explained Mr Jacques. ""It looks more like these people have been using these hot stones as a type of storage heater so that you've got a lot of warmth coming off them."" Mr Jacques will meet the UN experts later to ask for the route to be moved closer to Salisbury and for hydrological assessments to be made. ""It's very likely the water flow would be reduced in and around the site,"" he said. ""It would take out all the organics and destroy all the animal bone we've been finding which is crucial for finding where they have been living and for getting radiocarbon dates from all the organics like pollen and wood. ""This is massively important for reconstructing what the landscape would have looked like."" Andy Rhind-Tutt, former mayor and chairman of Amesbury Museum and Heritage Trust said: ""I sincerely hope the team delivering the long-awaited A303 improvement look seriously at an alternative alignment south of Salisbury and away from this unequalled archaeological landscape. ""It would be criminal to destroy such a rich heritage and connection with our ancestors for the sake of blocking the view to the passing public of Stonehenge.""",0,5,3

pegasus,Bats are damaging an 11th Century church in North Yorkshire by droppings and urine.,"A colony has been roosting in St Hilda's Church at Ellerburn, close to the North York Moors. But despite the church's best efforts the bats are not moving and are soiling the altar and church furniture, leaving the church with an ""appalling smell"". The creatures are protected by law and cannot be wilfully disturbed. Volunteers at the church have been working for the past decade to keep the altar, stonework and woodwork clean. But the bats, roosting in the higher areas of the church continually soil the interior of the building with urine and faeces. Church warden Liz Cowley said keeping the 11th Century building in good shape was difficult. She said: ""You can see the urine marks (on the altar), they won't go away. ""If people were coming in here damaging an ancient building like this, you would say it was criminal damage. ""The smell is appalling, it's a combination of ammonia from the urine and a musty smell from the droppings that catches at the back of the throat."" Members of the church had spent Â£10,000 trying to get the bats to move and had paid for specially-built lofts nearby. The Rev Paul Mothersdale, the Rector of St Hilda's Church, said a lot of money had been invested in trying to persuade the bats to move out of the church. The Rev Mothersdale said: ""We've tried to do everything that English Nature, or Natural England, have wanted us to do. ""Money has been spent, not only by the congregation, not only out of church funds, but local people have mucked in and helped. ""And yet we're no further forward, we're still as we were 10 years ago."" Lucy Bellini, of Natural England, said the bats had to be carefully monitored. Ms Bellini said: ""It is a really regionally important roost. ""Because of that we need to be sure that there are replacement roosts that are suitable and that the bats have found and are aware of and can move to before we allow the church to seal up access points and move the bats out of the church.""",1,5,4
pegasus,Bonuses are being offered to GP practices in England to reduce the number of patients seen in hospital.,"GP practices are being paid to help local NHS groups limit the number of patient referrals and cut costs, the doctors' magazine Pulse found. Appointments affected include scans and consultations with specialists - including those for cancer patients. The British Medical Association said such incentives were ""misguided"". At least nine clinical commissioning groups (CCGs) were offering GP practices payments for hitting targets, according to Pulse's investigation. In one case, Birmingham South Central CCG was offering practices more than Â£11,000 to reduce new outpatient attendances, follow-ups, A&E attendances and emergency admissions by 1%, compared with 2014/15. It said the schemes, which exclude cancer referrals, were designed to ""incentivise best quality practice"" and ""drive improvements in the quality of primary medical care"". ""Our priority is to ensure that patients have access to services that they need, when they need them,"" said a spokesperson for Birmingham South Central CCG. Another CCG told Pulse it had considered the ""full impact"" of the incentive scheme and was ""confident that there is no conflict of interest"". Pulse said that one scheme had already been looked at by the General Medical Council, the body which regulates medical standards in the UK, after local GP leaders expressed their concern. The magazine pointed out that initial hospital referrals for cancer patients should happen within two weeks of a GP first suspecting the condition. Dr Chand Nagpaul, chairman of the GPs committee of the doctors' trade union the British Medical Association, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that such schemes were a ""financial contaminant"" to patient-doctor trust. He said: ""It's short-sighted and misguided of CCGs to introduce such mechanisms, because they do lead to the potential for patients questioning the motives of GP referrals. ""We believe it is far more appropriate for CCGs to introduce clinical pathways that ensure patients are referred appropriately rather than these crude, salesman-like bonuses which pay GPs simply to make reduction to referrals in numerical terms."" Dr Peter Melton is local GP and clinical chief officer for North East Lincolnshire CCG, which offers the equivalent of more than Â£6,000 to practices that reduce outpatient referrals to the same level as the 25% with the lowest referral rates (which include two-week urgent cancer referrals) in 2014/15. He said the CCG was already among the best in England for referring suspected cancer patients to a consultant within two weeks and the scheme was not about avoiding sending people to hospital. ""It is not focussing on referral reduction per se but on better clinical and quality standards for the patient,"" he explained. ""The expectation is practices will be encouraged to investigate more locally and monitor the patient in the first instance rather than automatically refer in to a secondary care service."" Analysis by the BBC's Helen Briggs The NHS is under pressure to make savings, with a target of carving out Â£22bn of efficiency savings by 2020. NHS leaders want to cut patient referrals that are deemed inappropriate, particularly when patients could be cared for locally. Clinical Commissioning Groups (CCGs) are groups of GPs that work together to plan and",1,4,4
pegasus,"Boris Johnson is one of the UK's most high-profile politicians, but who is he?","Mr Johnson, the Mayor of London, announced on Sunday that he would be backing the campaign for Britain to leave the EU. His intervention in the debate - made, as he termed it, with ""deafening eclat"" - was even said to have helped cause the pound to slide on the international money markets as traders thought it made the possibility of a so-called Brexit more likely. He has arguably the highest profile of any of the governing Conservative Party except the Prime Minister David Cameron, but those outside the UK may be wondering: who is he, and is that actually his hair? Read on. Profile: Boris Johnson How could 'zip wire prat' become prime minister? Read more about the UK's referendum on the EU Alexander Boris de Pfeffel Johnson, to give him his full name, was born in New York and is descended from Turkish, French and German stock. He describes himself as a ""one-man melting pot"". He first made a name for himself in journalism, including a stint as Brussels correspondent for the right-wing Daily Telegraph newspaper and editor of The Spectator magazine. His humorous persona led him to become a fixture on various television programmes, including the satirical BBC panel show Have I Got News For You. He still has a lucrative and entertaining column in the Daily Telegraph, in which august forum he explained the reasons for his decision on the EU. As a politician, he has been a Conservative member of parliament for two constituencies, Henley from 2001 to 2008 and then Uxbridge and South Ruislip from 2015. Lest you think he was putting his feet up between parliamentary mandates, he is also currently serving the second of two terms as mayor of London, no mean feat in a city where the centre-left Labour Party has dominated in recent decades. That's indicative of the position Mr Johnson has carved out for himself as one of the most charismatic politicians in the UK who has wide appeal beyond Conservative heartlands - polling has suggested that his stance on the EU referendum may sway some undecided voters. Just look what happens when you type his name into Google.co.uk. Not quite. He has previously courted controversy for his remarks about (among others) the populations of Liverpool, Portsmouth and Papua New Guinea, not to mention run-ins with his own party leadership and TV chef Jamie Oliver. Last October he accidentally flattened a 10-year-old schoolboy at what was meant to be a friendly game of photo-op rugby in Japan. But none of this seems to have affected his standing among the party faithful or the public at large. Even getting stuck on a zip-wire during the London Olympics in 2012, a sure-fire route to derision for any other politician, only enhanced his eccentric image. Mr Johnson finally ended months of speculation about which side of the EU debate he would back in an immaculately impromptu media scrum outside his home in North London, having reportedly informed the prime minister of his decision earlier the same day. He said that he had come to",1,4,4

pegasus,"Cuts to adult social care budgets are forcing councils to cut back on care for the elderly and disabled, a survey suggests.","Councils in England are facing a £1.1bn shortfall this year, on top of ""almost unendurable"" cuts since 2010, the Association of Directors of Adult Social Services has warned. Freezing care provider fees to save money was no long sustainable, it said. Ministers say extra money will help NHS and social care services work together. The survey, which was completed by 147 directors of adult social services for councils in England, suggests that funding reductions to social care budgets have totalled £4.6bn since 2010 - a 31% overall reduction. Budgets for adult social care - which provides practical support to people due to illness, disability, old age or a low income - will reduce by a further £500m in cash terms this year, it said. ""Taking the growth in numbers of older and disabled people into account, this means that an additional £1.1bn would be needed to provide the same level of service as last year,"" the report warned. It said some councils had made savings in the past by freezing fees paid to providers, but care providers were now also facing financial problems. Some companies - particularly those in southern England - are struggling to attract staff, amid increasing concern about the quality of care, it said. ""What is at stake is the continuing capacity of adult social care to sustain services to those in greatest need,"" ADASS president Ray James said. ""In virtually all our authorities, the number in need is growing, while the complexity of their needs is increasing."" ADASS called for the government to ""protect essential care and support services to the most vulnerable members of our community"". But a government spokesman said the survey ""ignores"" a commitment to invest £10bn in health services that are being ""joined up"" with social care, by 2020. The BBC has launched an online guide to the care system for the over-65s. The ""care calculator"" covers residential care and the support provided in people's own homes, for tasks such as washing and dressing. Users can submit their postcode and find out how much each service costs where they live in the UK. There is also a dedicated BBC Cost of Care website, with news stories, analysis and video. The spokesman said: ""Increasing budgets isn't the only solution. By working innovatively and joining up health and social care we can improve care and also save money."" However, Councillor Izzi Seccombe, from the Local Government Association (LGA), said adult social care services were facing ""enormous pressures"" due to ""insufficient funding, growing demand and escalating costs"". ""We have long warned that investing in the NHS whilst social care budgets are under continual pressure is simply a false economy. ""It is social care services that support elderly and vulnerable people to maintain their independence, live in their own community and stay out of hospital longer,"" she added. Caroline Abrahams, charity director at Age UK, said the idea of a further £1bn coming out of social care budgets was ""chilling"". Sue Brown, vice chairman of the Care and Support Alliance - which represents 80 leading charities - said",1,5,4
pegasus,David Cameron is to host a summit in London aimed at tackling corruption.,"The international anti-corruption summit - the first of its kind - is aimed at exposing, punishing and drive out global corruption. Political leaders, businesses, sporting organisations, and charities will meet at Lancaster House on Thursday. Mr Cameron says corruption is ""the root of so many of the world's problems"". He also described it as ""an enemy of progress"". ""It destroys jobs and holds back economic growth, traps the poorest in desperate poverty, and undermines our security by pushing people towards extremist groups,"" he added. ""The battle against corruption will not be won overnight. It will take time, courage and determination to deliver the reforms that are necessary. But we cannot hope to solve the major global challenges we face without tackling the exploitation, fraud and dishonesty at their heart. ""For too long there has been a taboo about tackling this issue head-on. The summit will change that. Together we will push the fight against corruption to the top of the international agenda where it belongs."" Among the world leaders attending the summit are presidents Ashraf Ghani of Afghanistan, Juan Manuel Santos of Colombia and Muhammadu Buhari of Nigeria, and Norwegian prime minister Erna Solberg. Russia is to be represented by deputy foreign minister Oleg Syromolotov. Panellists are expected to include World Bank president Jim Yong Kim and International Monetary Fund's managing director Christine Lagarde. Under the prime minister's plans, leaders at the summit would pledge to expose corruption and pursue and punish those who perpetrate, facilitate or are complicit in it. Campaigners have also called for a crackdown on tax havens linked to the United Kingdom. The recent Panama Papers leak showed how some wealthy people use offshore firms to evade tax and avoid sanctions. A Downing Street spokesman said: ""We are in discussions with the Overseas Territories and Crown dependencies with major financial centres about their attendance, and expect a number to join the summit."" Robert Barrington, of anti-corruption campaigners Transparency International, said: ""The prime minister is creating a platform for governments that are serious about fighting corruption to make really significant changes and set the agenda for a generation to come. ""What is key now is that other governments are persuaded to sign up to ambitious targets and that the UK government does not give in to the usual last minute attempts by less committed countries to water down the summit's ambitions"".",1,5,4

pegasus,"Eight British people have been detained in Turkey on their way to Syria, the BBC understands.","The group, reported to be three men, two women and four children aged from two to 11, was held at Reyhanli, in Hatay province, near the Syrian border. Their intention in travelling to the region, where areas are controlled by Islamic State (IS) militants or an al-Qaeda affiliate, is not clear. The Foreign Office has said it is in contact with the Turkish authorities. The BBC's Mark Lowen said the information about the ages of the children had not been independently verified and it was too early to know where the group were intending to head to. ""Were they heading for one of the more moderate groups in Syria. Were they heading for the area controlled by al-Nusra, the al-Qaeda affiliate? Or were they heading to so-called Islamic State territory?"" he said. The group was taken to a police station in southern Turkey overnight, and then sent to the foreigners department awaiting deportation to the UK. They have undergone medical examinations and had their finger-prints taken. The United Nations estimates the number of foreign fighters joining militant groups is more than 25,000, from 100 different nations. About 600 Britons are believed to have gone to Syria or Iraq since IS seized control of large swathes of territory there. Most are thought to have volunteered as fighters for the militant Islamist group. Around half are believed to have later returned to the UK, the Metropolitan Police has said. The latest detentions come two weeks after three British teenagers were stopped from travelling into Syria from Turkey. The three - two aged 17 and one 19, from north-west London - were arrested following a tip-off from British police and flown back to the UK. They have since been released on police bail. They had flown to Turkey from Barcelona and were arrested at Sabiha Gokcen airport in Istanbul. Fadi Hakura, Turkey analyst for Chatham House, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the recent arrests showed the Turkish government was ""taking more effective measures to control the flow of fighters and supporters into Syria"". He said there was now ""more enhanced security and intelligence cooperation between Turkey and its Western counterparts, especially with the exchange of names that Turkey needs to prohibit [IS supporters] from crossing into Syria"". The Turkish government has said it cannot make a 560-mile border watertight and will act when it has prior warning. In February this year there were recriminations between British police and Turkish officials after three London schoolgirls disappeared from Turkey, apparently having crossed the border into Syria. Shamima Begum, Amira Abase, both 15, and Kadiza Sultana, 16 had flown to Istanbul and travelled to the border region. Turkish officials said they had not been warned promptly enough by British police to intercept them - Scotland Yard denied this.",0,5,3
pegasus,England were denied victory on the final day of the first Test against Pakistan in Abu Dhabi.,"Pakistan seemed to be cruising to a draw before debutant Adil Rashid - who returned 0-163 in the first innings - turned the match with five wickets. Needing 99 to win, England sent out Jos Buttler and Ben Stokes in the top four. But they were eventually beaten by the fading light, finishing 25 runs short of a famous victory on 74-4. The tourists could not find the boundary frequently enough before the umpires brought the teams off, with Joe Root 33 not out. However, this was a hugely impressive performance from England and one that will fill them with confidence ahead of the second Test in Dubai, which begins on Thursday. After England concluded their innings on 598-9 in the morning, Pakistan looked assured at 113-3 shortly after tea, leading by 38 with seven second-innings wickets remaining. But the match turned when veteran batsman Younus Khan, playing in his 102nd Test match, mistimed a wild heave to give Rashid his first Test wicket - caught at point by Stokes. Rashid - whose figures in the first innings were the worst ever by a debutant - then quickly added a second victim, having Asad Shafiq caught behind for six. The door was opened for England, and Rashid and Moeen Ali barged through it as they polished off the last five wickets for 14 runs. Pakistan skipper Misbah ul-Haq - who had played with restraint for his 51 - inexplicably aimed an uncharacteristic slog at Moeen and was bowled. Moeen then removed Wahab Riaz caught behind, before Rashid claimed the final three wickets - all superbly caught at first slip by James Anderson. England sensed an unlikely victory, but their reorganised batting order could not score quickly enough as Pakistan's tactic of spin from both ends and fielders on the boundary brought them regular wickets. Makeshift opener Buttler was trapped lbw for four, Moeen and Stokes were caught on the boundary in quick succession, and Jonny Bairstow was stumped attempting a big shot. However, in truth it was mistakes earlier in the match that ultimately proved more costly as England fell just short of their first win on the subcontinent since beating India in Kolkata in 2012. In Pakistan's first innings, Ian Bell dropped Mohammad Hafeez (98) and Shafiq (107) at slip early in their innings. And Shoaib Malik, who made 245, was dismissed off a no-ball by Stuart Broad. England captain Alastair Cook, whose record-breaking 263 in the first innings was ultimately in vain, admitted England were frustrated to come so close to victory. ""We'd have liked another three or four overs at the end but that's the way it goes,"" he said. ""I can't fault the guys for hanging in there on that wicket. ""The pitch did deteriorate and spun more today which gave us hope, so it's a bit of a bittersweet finish. We knew we had to put the pressure on Pakistan and then on the last day you never know. ""We played a good game and so did Pakistan. They were a bit sloppy today and we put",0,5,4

He was also ordered to carry out 150 hours' unpaid work at Highbury Corner Magistrates' Court. District judge Susan Williams also ordered him to pay Â£145 in costs and charges. She said that, although Carlisle had made a ""positive contribution"" to others through football, she had to sentence him for the risk his ""erratic"" driving had created. ""If you are not in control of your vehicle in a road in central London you represent a danger to people,"" she said. At a hearing in March, the court heard Carlisle's Mercedes had been spotted ""swerving"" and ""almost mounting the pavement"" in Pentonville Road. After his arrest, the court heard, he refused to give a breath sample and demanded to speak to his solicitor. Lisa Judge, defending, said he allowed the matter to ""escalate out of all control"" and ""unfortunately"" believed he had the right to see a lawyer, instead of being breathalysed. Carlisle has revealed he attempted to take his own life two days afterwards, when he was hit by a lorry on the A64 near York. Miss Judge described the arrest as having happened while he was ""in an extremely dark place in terms of his own life"". Carlisle is now so sorry about what happened that the court-ordered medical report on him ""utterly oozes remorse"", Miss Judge said. The court was told Carlisle had been involved in ""excess drinking offences"" in 1999 and 2011.

Marussia said surgeons at Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge ""embarked on a lengthy procedure to address the serious head and facial injuries sustained by Maria in the accident"". It said: ""The operation began yesterday afternoon and she was in theatre until this morning. ""Maria remains in a critical but stable condition.""

De Villota sustained her injuries after her car ""suddenly accelerated"" into the back of the support lorry, according to witnesses. BBC Radio Cambridgeshire presenter Chris Mann, who saw the accident, said: ""The top of her car and her helmet seemed to take the brunt of it. ""She didn't move for about 15 minutes."" He said De Villota had been driving at up to 200mph during the testing, but the car was travelling considerably slower at the time of the crash. Mr Booth said: ""With regard to the accident, we have embarked on a very comprehensive analysis of what happened and this work continues for the moment."" Messages of support have come in from the motor racing world, including ones from Ferrari driver and fellow Spaniard Fernando Alonso and Jenson Button. Formula 1 driver and BBC analyst Jaime Alguersari said in his weekly column : ""I was shocked to hear of the accident suffered by Maria de Villota. I know her and her family very well.

""Under 26 seconds for the second time - only four hundredths of a second off his best time. It was, again, an immense swim."" Karen Pickering, British 2001 world 4x200m freestyle gold medallist We all know how strong Peaty is. In his semi-final he was a little bit lower in the water as he set his world record. Because he's not quite as high as he is in the 100m, he has a quicker turnover. He can keep that up for 50m, but not for a 100m - that's why he went to 25.95 seconds. You couldn't do that in the 100m because of the build-up of lactic acid. But because it's Adam Peaty, he might be able to manage that in a year.

The building has regenerated the area around Melton Mowbray's railway station, once a muddy pot-holed piece of wasteland where those in the know parked for free. Now the council offices link the station to a park and the town centre. It was partly paid for with insurance money after a fire destroyed the old offices on the other side of town. A supermarket moved in to replace it and helped with the money too, putting the council on a firm financial footing. But that was four years ago and the crisis is a different one today. It's being experienced by all local authorities - cuts in central government funding which threaten the services they provide. Mr Rhodes is also deputy leader of Leicestershire County Council, with responsibility for finance. Leicestershire is historically the poorest funded council in the country because of a quirk of Whitehall recalculations, going back a quarter of a century since the poll tax, or community charge, was scrapped. At the moment councils get income from council tax, a share of the business rates, any income they generate themselves from services plus a grant from central government. It's the grant cut which is causing them grief. What's called the ""core funding"" is worked out by the number of homes multiplied by a set amount. And each authority has a different value set per dwelling. If we look at Surrey, which is top of the table, the amount will be £1,686 by 2019/20. Nottinghamshire is mid-table at £1,482, Derbyshire is in the lower reaches with £1,422 per dwelling and then comes Leicestershire at £1,354. ""The funding system is chaotic,"" says Byron Rhodes. ""It doesn't reflect real need. Look at Oxfordshire which is an interesting example,"" he says with a glint in his eye. Could he possibly be referring to the prime ministerial plea to the county council about cutbacks to services there? ""If we had the same funding as Oxfordshire, we'd have £50m a year extra. If we had the same as Surrey, we'd have £100m more. We'd be partying everyday if we had that kind of money."" Leicestershire have been helped with a small share of what's been called transitional funding - about £300m to help councils following pressure from Conservative MPs. Think back to the vote on Sunday trading. With a majority of only 17 in the Commons, the Conservatives lost the vote when 20 odd rebelled. Last month there would've been another rebellion, including some of our own Tory MPs in the East Midlands, if something wasn't done to improve the local government finance settlement over the next four years. The money has gone largely to shire counties. Leicestershire got £6.6m spread over two years, enough to save some services from closure. But it's a drop in the ocean for an authority with a £19m black hole in the budget every year after the latest cutbacks. Labour have protested that 83% of the councils getting transition funding are Conservative-run. Many Labour-run",0,3,1
pegasus,"In the US state of Maine, a small but growing number of businesses are tapping into a tradition that dates back more than 1,000 years.","But what's brewing in this new crop of commercial meaderies - as they are known - is lot more refined from the drink that once decorated tables across medieval Europe. ""Do we have any mead makers or home brewers in the group?"" asks Ben Alexander, eying a crowd of a dozen or so people who have come to his Maine Meade Works, in Portland, on a rainy Friday for a tour. When no-one raises their hand, Mr Alexander launches into the full spiel. ""If you guys want to come around, I'll show you how this thing works,"" he says, gesturing to two ceiling-high columns of stainless steel filled with something resembling a mushy golden porridge. ""We mix up honey and water over there and we pump it through a hot water bath at 160 degrees [71C] in a stainless steel coil here. Each one produces about 50 to 75 gallons [227-340 litres] of mead a day,"" explains Mr Alexander. It's fair to say he is obsessed with mead. ""It's the quintessential local beverage - you can go anywhere in the world and find honey to make mead, and I think that's unique among alcoholic beverages,"" he gushes. After being introduced to the drink by a home brewer, Mr Alexander thought there were profits to be had in a commercial meadery. He founded Maine Mead Works in 2008, pouring his savings and money from friends and family into the business. His business has since grown, along with the popularity of mead in the US. It's now a seven-person operation that manufactures more than 7,500 cases a year, shipping them as far away as China. Mr Alexander is not the only one to have caught on to the commercial potential of mead. Vicky Rowe, the owner of mead information website GotMead, says interest in the product in the US has exploded in the past decade. ""We went from 30-40 meaderies making mead to somewhere in the vicinity of 250 in the last 10 years,"" she says. ""I like to say that everything old is new again - people come back to what was good once."" Even visitors to Mr Alexander's meadery agree. Tour participant Dirk Heseman admitted that while Maine Mead Works was the first meadery he'd actually visited, he has noticed that mead ""is becoming more and more available - similar to cider"". Just this year, commercial meaderies in the US have banded together to form an industry group, the American Mead Makers Association, to better share information and encourage growth in the industry. But there's a lot of work that needs to be done to improve the image of a drink long associated with Renaissance fairs and medieval re-enactments. ""I think our number one challenge as an industry is awareness of what mead is,"" says Mr Alexander. ""You ask 10 people in a room if they've ever heard of mead, and two of them might say, 'yes', and only one of them has had a very positive experience."" The mead of the past was often sweet, and didn't appeal to many drinkers",1,5,4
pegasus,India's economy grew at its slowest pace in more than three years in the January-to-March quarter.,"India's gross domestic product (GDP) grew by 5.3% in the quarter compared with a year earlier, data showed. That is down from 6.1% in the previous quarter. Analysts were expecting the same figure for January to March. India is the third-largest economy in Asia but has been struggling with inflation and currency weakness. Since July last year, the Indian rupee has seen one of the biggest declines among Asian currencies, dropping more than 27% against the US dollar. ""Shocking numbers as growth was even lower than lows witnessed during the financial crisis,"" said Anubhuti Sahay from Standard Chartered Bank in Mumbai. The BBC's Yogita Limaye in Mumbai said that just a year ago India was aspiring for double-digit growth. But a global slowdown has reduced external demand, and high inflation coupled with a weak rupee has made things more expensive within the country. Domestic demand, which India's economy is largely reliant on, has also slowed in part due to the political upheaval in the country. India's economy is suffering from ""policy incoherence, shifting global risk appetite and a comatose government"", said Rajeev Malik, senior economist at brokerage CLSA India's Prime Minister Manmohan Singh admitted early this month that his government must do more to get the once fast-growing economy moving again. The Congress-led coalition government is caught up in a slew of corruption scandals. Key policy reforms, including allowing foreign investment in India's retail sector, have been delayed in parliament for more than a year. This has worried foreign investors and threatened the country's investment grade credit rating. ""This is definitely a very important signal for the government - this is a make or break situation for India and the government has to step on the panic button,"" said Rupa Rege Nitsure, chief economist at Bank of Baroda in Mumbai. ""If the government doesn't step in now, India's sovereign ratings may be jeopardised.""",0,5,4
pegasus,Inverness Caledonian Thistle's Premiership survival hopes were dealt a further blow as St Johnstone cruised to victory at McDiarmid Park.,"Steven Maclean bundled home the opener five minutes before half-time. The hosts, slacker after the break, had beleaguered striker Larnell Cole sent-off after he confronted the referee. Liam Craig sealed the win from the penalty spot with two minutes to play, before Graham Cummins finished a sumptuous stoppage-time move. And things got worse still for Caley Thistle after the match, with captain Gary Warren shown a red card in the tunnel. Saints remain five points clear of Hearts in fourth place, and closed the gap on third-placed Rangers, who play Aberdeen on Sunday, to three points. With game after game ticking past, Inverness' position looks increasingly perilous. Next weekend's trip to Motherwell, second-bottom on goal difference, is now seismic. This contest turned nightmarish for the hosts after a bright opening, but the truth is, given their predicament, Caley Thistle did not threaten St Johnstone's goal enough. Billy Mckay sent a shot over from close range. Alex Fisher nodded a diving header wide. Carl Tremarco miscued a volley. Greg Tansey did draw a save from Alan Mannus when he rasped in an effort from outside the box, but Richie Foran's side never looked likely to find the net. Their best opportunity came immediately after the Saints went ahead, when Tansey fed Cole, who seemed to panic in a terrific position and shot straight at Mannus. Cole's dismissal ended the contest when he appeared to be cautioned twice for challenging referee Stephen Finnie's decision not to award a foul. St Johnstone were merciless and could have had more. With just one win from their last 21 league games, Inverness look deep in trouble. Tommy Wright's side deserve so much credit. Saints were tactically brilliant, so strong defensively and ruthlessly capitalised on their man advantage. They took one of their few first-half chances when Michael Coulson broke down the left and sent a dangerous ball across the six-yard box. Owain Fon Williams could only parry into the danger area, Cummins' shot was blocked but Maclean followed up to force it home. They should have had another when Craig's superb curling corner flew all the way to the back post where Cummins slid in and somehow knocked it over from two yards. Craig, in his 300th appearance for the club, coolly converted a spot-kick after Cummins was tripped to seal the points. Cummins then slammed home after Miller danced around the area to tee him up, before Craig cracked the bar amid the late flurry. With a tendency to finish the season strongly, and just a three-point gap to Rangers, the Perth side look capable of something special this term. Inverness CT manager Richie Foran: ""It is a tough time of the season to be sitting bottom, and I need real men to stand up to that, but not enough of them did that today. ""It is pure luck we are still in it and it is only four points. I sound like a broken record but one win changes it - that is the truth. But I need braver players with more passion and desire.",0,4,3

pegasus,It's now a year to go until the next assembly election and it's fair to say there's a lot of work to be done.,"The Conservatives have been given a huge confidence boost and will feel in a position to challenge in more constituencies next year, rather than just on the list. At the party's weekly press briefing, I asked the Welsh Conservative leader Andrew RT Davies, who was elected on the list, whether he'd stand as a constituency candidate in his home turf of the Vale of Glamorgan but he said he hadn't thought about it. Presumably those are the kind of decisions they will now feel more confident contemplating. The party will also have a huge amount of new data on voters which it'll be able to call upon and the belief that campaigning hard on the NHS helped the Tories cross the line in places like the Vale of Clwyd and Gower. The Conservatives feel it's them, rather than any of the other opposition parties, who have become the repository of votes from those who are disaffected by the state of the NHS. Welsh Labour are going to hold a ""short sharp"" analysis into what went wrong. Carwyn Jones was in line with most of the criticism of Ed Miliband when he told AMs that the party needed to appeal to small business owners who are not millionaires but who work hard. What will be more difficult is countering the argument on the NHS, which the former minister Alun Davies believes is already lost. Another potential difficulty for Welsh Labour will be dealing with unhappiness within the party over council re-organisation. Bernie Attridge, the deputy leader of Flintshire Council, has tweeted saying the party needs to be careful on local government reform if it wants to retain the support of grassroots councillors. It also seems to have been the case that Labour lost more votes to UKIP than the Conservatives, which is another challenge to overcome. But Labour will at least have the advantage that it will be David Cameron, and not Ed Miliband, carrying out the latest round of public sector cuts that are likely to take effect sooner rather than later. The question is whether Carwyn Jones is going to be able to turn that to his advantage when his own record in government will be under scrutiny. Plaid Cymru's education spokesman, Simon Thomas, also in the party's weekly press briefing, said he believed Leanne Wood could portray herself as an alternative first minister because of the way she emotionally connected with people in the campaign. The party now has a year to make that a credible proposition after it failed to gain any new seats and came fourth, behind UKIP, in the overall share of the vote, despite her unprecedented profile. He also said that on the campaign trail people wanted to know what Plaid was going to do about the NHS and that people ""did not see the strengths"" of its arguments. The Welsh Liberal Democrats are still licking their wounds but in a ""je ne regrette rien"" moment, the leader Kirsty Williams said she had no regrets over the coalition. She has admitted the party failed to communicate",1,3,4
pegasus,Kenya's election commission has been forced to delay the announcement of presidential and parliamentary results for a second day.,"Returning officers were ordered to physically deliver paper copies of their constituency's tallies to the counting centre in the capital. Election officials have urged patience. Uhuru Kenyatta, who faces trial at the International Criminal Court, has been leading in early presidential results declared from Monday's tightly contested election. He is due to stand trial at The Hague next month for allegedly fuelling violence after the disputed 2007 election. He denies the charge. His closest rival is outgoing Prime Minister Raila Odinga. With provisional results in from more than 40% of polling stations earlier on Wednesday, Mr Odinga had 42% of the vote compared with Mr Kenyatta's 53%. However, Mr Odinga's allies remain confident that he will gain ground as results from his strongholds, including the Coast Province, are declared. More than 1,000 people were killed in the violence which broke out in 2007-08 after Mr Odinga claimed he had been cheated of victory by supporters of President Mwai Kibaki, who is stepping down after two terms in office. The BBC's Solomon Mugera in the capital, Nairobi, says Kenyans are becoming increasingly anxious about the delay in finalising the results. Some businesses and schools across the country have remained shut since Monday's election, he says. This has led to a shortage of goods, pushing up the prices of basic foodstuff in areas such as Kibera, the biggest slum in Nairobi and a stronghold of Mr Odinga, our correspondent adds. Uhuru Kenyatta Raila Odinga Profile: Uhuru Kenyatta Profile: Raila Odinga Some electoral officials have had to drive hundreds of kilometres to the counting centre in Nairobi to deliver paper copies of the tally of their returns. At about 13:00 local time, returning officers from only 53 of the 290 constituencies had arrived and the election commission said it would announce results from constituencies as they were ready. Its website had stopped giving updated results from the presidential race on Wednesday, and was still showing figures from Tuesday night. Our correspondent says the large number of spoiled ballots - about 6% of the total vote, well over double the number of votes cast for the third-placed candidate, Musailia Mudavadi - has become a major bone of contention. Mr Odinga's Coalition of Reforms and Democracy (Cord) wants them to be counted, but Mr Kenyatta's Jubilee Coalition is resisting this. Late on Tuesday, the election commission announced that the spoiled ballots would count in the overall vote total, increasing the likelihood of a run-off between the top two candidates, news agencies report. Mr Kenyatta's running mate William Ruto, who is also facing a trial at the ICC, said foreign embassies may have influenced such a decision. ""We want to believe that this is not an attempt to deny the Jubilee Coalition a first-round victory as is clearly now on the wall,"" he is quoted by Reuters news agency as saying.

He added: ""We have a lot of beautiful things to fight for and to qualify for the Champions League will be a huge success. But we have to be honest with ourselves.

Guardiola has also responded to questions about a row between City and Chelsea coaching staff at Stamford Bridge following the defeat on Wednesday night. There have been conflicting claims about the precise nature of the row, but stewards were needed to calm the situation down after Chelsea's 2-1 win. The incident centred around a disagreement between Chelsea fitness coach Paolo Bertelli and Manchester City masseur Mark Sertori, both of whom speak Italian, as the Premier League leaders celebrated their victory. Guardiola said: ""We are so polite in our defeats and we are so polite when we win. When we win, normally we celebrate a little bit, then we go to the locker room.

College principal Chris Wilkes said the decision was related to ""low student numbers rather than any other reason"". He said it would continue to focus on adult education. Famous Ruskin College alumni include former deputy prime minister John Prescott and Dennis Skinner, MP for Bolsover in Derbyshire. BA English Studies, BA History with Social Sciences and MA Women's Studies are being discontinued. Anne Hughes, 63, from Thame in Oxfordshire, has been studying BA English Studies part-time at the college for two years. She said she was ""absolutely distraught"" it was being cut. She is physically disabled and has depression, and said she chose to study at the college because it worked with ""disadvantaged, disabled and mature students"". The college also offers bespoke timetables, unlike some other places of higher education, she added. Online petitions have been set up in a bid to save the English faculty and the Women's Studies course. One signatory, Jenny Lewis, wrote on the first petition: ""[Tutors] Helen Kidd and Tom Sherry are carrying on the great Ruskin tradition of bringing opportunities to those that otherwise would not have them."" Student and activist Saskia Ritchie, who set up the second petition, said Ruskin had been set up for ""people who would traditionally be excluded from academia"" and gives ""access to truly excellent learning opportunities"". Mr Wilkes said the college would lose about 25 students as a result of the cuts. He added degrees had been on offer at the college for about 10 years and were ""relatively new"" considering the college's 116-year history.

pegasus,More than 50 homes could be built on the site of a former care home at the centre of a housing scandal.,"In 2008, elderly residents were moved out of Greyhound Opening in Norwich and senior city council officers moved in. The council's head of neighbourhood and strategic housing, Kristine Reeves, was later sacked over the affair. The development proposals, put forward by Norwich City Council, include 60 flats and 45 houses. The report to the council says 35 of the houses and flats will be for social rent. A report to Norwich City Council's planning committee, which meets on Thursday, advises councillors to approve the plans. Elderly residents were moved out of Greyhound Opening and nearby Goldsmith Street seven years ago after Norwich City Council agreed to redevelop the site. The council agreed that new employees relocating to the city could move in temporarily ahead of demolition. However other staff, including Ms Reeves, also moved in, in contravention of council policy. The council resisted calls for a full independent inquiry. Its own investigation found safeguards covering conflicts of interest were in place but not followed.

pegasus,More than one million people have signed a petition against a proposed EU-US trade deal.,"The petition calls on the EU and its member states to stop the talks on the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership or TTIP. It also says they should not ratify a similar deal that has already been done between the EU and Canada. It says some aspects pose a threat to democracy and the rule of law. One of the concerns mentioned in the petition is the idea of tribunals that foreign investors would be able to use in some circumstances to sue governments. There is a great deal of controversy over exactly what this system, known as Investor State Dispute Settlement, would enable companies to do, but campaigners see it as an opportunity for international business to get compensation for government policy changes that adversely affect them. This kind of provision exists in many bilateral trade and investment agreements. Friends of the Earth have published new research on the impact they have had on EU countries. Information about these cases is not always made public, but the group says that going back to 1994, foreign investors have sought compensation of almost €30bn (£24bn) from 20 states. Where the results are known (a small minority of the total), the tribunals have awarded total compensation of €3.5bn (about £2.8bn). In Britain, the possible implications of this provision for the National Health Service have been especially controversial. Campaigners believe that the investor tribunals would make it harder to reverse any decisions to contract services out to international healthcare firms. John Hilary of War on Want said: TTIP ""will make it impossible for any future government to repeal the Health & Social Care Act and bring the NHS back into public hands"". The petition lists a number of other areas where its signatories believes European standards would suffer if the TTIP negotiations are completed and the Canada deal is ratified: employment, social, environmental, privacy and consumer protection. The European Commission says the EU will not have to sacrifice its high standards. It also says investor protection provisions are important for investment flows and have in general worked well. But it accepts there is a need for improvement and is trying to achieve that in its bilateral negotiations. The petition has been organised as an exercise called a European Citizens' Initiative which can lead to a public hearing in the European Parliament and require the European Commission to give a formal response explaining why it is accepting or rejecting what the petitioners call for. The European Commission has already said that the petition doesn't qualify as such an Initiative. Campaigners have launched a legal challenge to this decision.",0,5,4
pegasus,Morocco's readmission to the African Union (AU) has been welcomed by Western Sahara.,"It was a ""good opportunity"" and ""a chance to work together,"" a top Western Sahara official told the BBC. Morocco controls two-thirds of Western Sahara and sees it as part of its historic territory. However some, including the UN, see Western Sahara as Africa's last colony. Africa Live: More on this and other stories Find out more about Western Sahara A referendum was promised in 1991 but never carried out due to wrangling over who was eligible to vote. Thousands of Sahrawi refugees still live in refugee camps in Algeria - some have been there for 40 years. It is not clear what happens next but Western Sahara is hopeful that a committee set up by the AU will address the issues that both sides have raised. Some AU delegates said that it would be easier to resolve the issue with Morocco inside the AU. Sidi Mohammed, a Western Sahara official, told the BBC that Morocco's return to the AU means that it would now be expected to put ""in practice decisions taken by the AU with regard to a referendum in Western Sahara"". Mr Mohammed dismissed the suggestion that Morocco would now seek to get the AU to change its position, saying that the no country could unilaterally change the AU fundamental agreement, saying it opposed colonisation. In his speech at the AU summit, King Mohammed VI of Morocco said the readmission was not meant to divide the continental body. No. Algeria has always been a big supporter of Western Sahara's Polisario Front and it had wanted Morocco to accept independence of the territory as a condition for readmission. Zimbabwe and South Africa were also supportive of this stance but they were outnumbered by those who wanted Morocco back in the fold. There is no specific provision in the AU charter that bars any country from joining it. Morocco simply applied and the request was accepted by more than two-thirds of the 53 members. Morocco has been involved in intense lobbying and applied in July last year to rejoin the continental body. King Mohammed toured various African countries seeking support for the bid. No. While culturally the country's identity aligns with Arab states, its economic interests increasingly lie in Africa. This is a strategic move to continue exploring its interests in mining, construction, medical, insurance and banking sectors on the continent.

Even though his last job in Scotland involved leading a team on Champions League duty, Lennon's mind has not been swayed by haughtiness. The appointment of the former Celtic manager as successor to Alan Stubbs suits both parties, because it is mutually beneficial. Success is alluring, and Hibs offer Lennon the chance to accumulate more achievements. He was immediately engaged in crisis management at his previous club Bolton, but will find stability, potential and accomplishment at Easter Road. The demand will be to deliver promotion, but that will not seem daunting when the majority of the squad that pushed Rangers for a while last season then won the Scottish Cup is still in place. Lennon's task is to refine and bolster the team, when new managers are often faced with a period of overhaul. Stubbs left the club on an emotional high after delivering their first Scottish Cup in 114 years, but before the final against Rangers there was a tangible sense of exasperation that promotion had been missed. Hibs were entitled to feel that it was an unnecessary failure given their circumstances. The club is about to embark on a third season in the Championship, but by most other measures they can be considered a top-flight outfit. The budget will be significantly more than the rest of the teams in the division, the training ground at East Mains and facilities are first-class, the football side of the business is stable and well-run by George Craig, the club's head of football operations, the squad is full of talent. Lennon can rely on consistently assured performances from the likes of David Gray, Darren McGregor, Paul Hanlon, Lewis Stevenson, John McGinn, Fraser Fyvie, Dylan McGeouch, James Keatings and Jason Cummings. Some minor issues remain, such as who will fill the goal next season, but the challenge is more on adding depth and strength of will to the squad and man-management. McGinn, one of the most reliably effective players in the Championship last season, has already insisted that he remains committed to Hibs despite the failure to achieve promotion. The 21-year-old midfielder provides the kind of industry and spirit that a team can be built around. There may be critical decisions to make, though, since Cummings is entering the final year of his contract and so represents a sellable asset. He is a regular goalscorer, though, and Stubbs had to sign Anthony Stokes on loan last January to provide some support up front. These are tweaks compared to the amount of work Stubbs had to carry out when he was appointed two years ago. Hibs are ready to be guided forward, not waiting to be rescued. When Lennon left Celtic two years ago, it was to pursue a",0,5,4
pegasus,Nine members of a Chinese cult have gone on trial accused of beating a woman to death in a McDonald's restaurant.,"The woman, 37-year-old Wu Shuoyan, is alleged to have been killed last May simply for refusing to hand over her phone number to cult members. The murder, filmed on CCTV and on mobile phones, sparked outrage. The Church of the Almighty God cult is banned in China but claims to have millions of members. Following the brutal killing in May, Chinese authorities said that they detained hundreds of members of the cult, reports the BBC's Martin Patience in Beijing. Interviewed in prison later, one of the defendants, Zhang Lidong showed no remorse. He said: ""I beat her with all my might and stamped on her too. She was a demon. We had to destroy her."" The group had entered a small McDonalds branch in Zhaoyuan in Shandong province last May soliciting phone numbers and hoping to recruit members to their cult. Ms Wu was waiting in the restaurant with her seven-year-old son and when she refused to give her number, an act which prompted the beating while they screamed at other diners to keep away or they would face the same fate. The public face of the Church of the Almighty God is a website full of uplifting hymns and homilies. But its core belief is that God has returned to earth as a Chinese woman to wreak the apocalypse. The only person who claims direct contact with this god is a former physics teacher, Zhao Weishan, who founded the cult 25 years ago and has since fled to the United States, says BBC China Editor Carrie Gracie. No-one knows exactly where he is, but much of the website's message of outright hostility to the Chinese government is delivered in English as well as Chinese. The cult complains that religious faith has suffered from persecution by the Communist Party. Since the McDonald's murder, public outrage has forced the authorities to increase pressure on the Church of the Almighty God with almost daily arrests and raids.",0,5,4

Now sales made through subsidiaries in the UK, Germany, Spain and Italy will be registered in those countries, the retailer has said. Amazon had received heavy criticism for its tax avoidance policies. ""More than two years ago, we began the process of establishing local country branches of Amazon EU Sarl, our primary retail operating company in Europe,"" the company said in a statement. ""As of 1 May, Amazon EU Sarl is recording retail sales made to customers through these branches in the UK, Germany, Spain and Italy. ""Previously, these retail sales were recorded in Luxembourg."" Amazon added that it was ""working on opening a branch for France"". In recent years, the European Union has intensified its investigations into the tax deals negotiated by global companies with countries such as Ireland, Luxembourg and the Netherlands. It suspects that such deals amount to illegal state aid and distort competition. Last year, the European Commission - the EU's executive arm - launched a formal investigation into Amazon's tax arrangements with Luxembourg. And the EU is also looking into tech giant Apple's tax dealings in Ireland, coffee-shop chain Starbucks' dealings in the Netherlands, and Italian carmaker Fiat's agreement with Luxembourg.",0,5,3

pegasus,"Plans for new marine protected areas in Welsh waters have been scrapped, the natural resources minister has said.","Alun Davies told AMs they had received 7,000 responses to a consultation containing ""strongly held"" views. He said he would now look at the 125 existing marine protected areas to see if further improvements could be made. The Marine Conservation Society (MCS) described it as an ""embarrassing U-turn"" for the Welsh government, and has called for better protection of seas. Creating the zones would mean a ban on fishing and anchoring in some areas and had brought opposition. The Welsh Fishermen's Association said previously that existing conservation networks for Welsh waters are adequate. The Welsh government proposed the zones last year with the backing of the Countryside Council of Wales and the Marine Conservation Society. The minister for natural resources said the decision had been made after the thousands of responses to the consultation brought ""divergent and strongly held views"". Mr Davies said to ""avoid any continuing uncertainty over the options presented in the 2012 consultation, I am also withdrawing all the proposed sites"". His comments come after the findings were published of a task and finish team which reviewed the feedback. Now, he will concentrate on the existing 125 Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) that cover 36% of Welsh seas to see if any changes can be made rather than creating additional zones. ""We are now in a stronger position to assess our current contribution to the network's ecological coherence,"" he said. ""I have, therefore, commissioned an assessment of our current MPAs to identify if there are any gaps and what the options might be to fill those gaps. ""If any measures are required, I believe they should be simple, proportionate and fit for purpose."" Dr Peter Richardson, biodiversity programme manager for MCS, said the Welsh government ""spent an awful lot of time and money and encouraged other people to put effort into this consultation response"". He said: ""70% of the consultation responses were in favour of designating these sites and yet today the minister has announced he's scrapping the whole thing... bit of an embarrassing U-turn for the government I think."" He added: ""I think there are plenty of people in the fishing industry... that understand that in order to get the best yields from the marine habitats on which they depend, they have to be managed properly.""",1,5,5
pegasus,"Police have said they have seized a ""significant"" number of weapons in a forest in County Antrim.","A ""terrorist hide"" was uncovered at Capanagh Forest near Larne after two members of the public found suspicious objects in the woods on Saturday. Some of the items found included an armour-piercing improvised rocket and two anti-personnel mines. The main line of police inquiry is the arms belonged to dissident republicans. Last week, Home Secretary Theresa May said MI5 believed an attack on targets in Great Britain by dissident republicans had become ""a strong possibility"". Analysis: Vincent Kearney, BBC News NI's home affairs correspondent The discovery of what appears to be a second dissident republican arms dump near Larne within three months has left police baffled. Based on location alone, the analysis would be that the items found most likely belonged to loyalist paramilitaries. But the nature of what was found suggests otherwise and the finger of suspicion firmly in the direction of dissident republicans. Det Supt Kevin Geddes said the threat level in Northern Ireland from dissident republican groups remains ""severe"" and an attack is ""highly likely"". Police officers found three barrels hidden in holes in the forest. As well as rockets and mines, there were also several pipe bombs, assault rifle ammunition and parts to construct a ""substantial number of explosive devices"". Det Supt Geddes said the seizure was significant ""both in terms of its size and its capability"". ""A number of these devices were ready to be deployed,"" he added. ""This seizure has undoubtedly saved lives."" He said the type of weapons that had been found meant police would focus their investigation on dissident republicans. In March, an arms find was made at Carnfunnock Country Park near Larne, and police said the were investigating a connection between the two discoveries. ""There are links in terms of the general location and the manner and method of storage and packaging of these munitions,"" Det Supt Geddes said. He added that police are ""indebted"" to the two people who noticed the suspicious objects in the Capanagh Forest.",0,5,4

The man, sporting a side parting and a trademark moustache, had been seen having his photograph taken outside the house in Braunau am Inn in which Adolf Hitler was born. The lookalike had recently moved to the town on the German border, police spokesman David Furtner told the BBC. Mr Furtner said this was not a joke or a piece of performance art. ""The young man knows exactly what he is doing,"" the police spokesman said. He said the man had also been spotted in Vienna and Graz. Pictures of the man were published by Austria's Heute.at news website on Monday. Glorifying the Nazi era is a crime in Austria. Last October, the Austrian authorities decided to demolish Hitler's birthplace house to stop it becoming a focal point for neo-Nazis. Hitler was born in a rented room on the top floor of the building on 20 April 1889. During Nazi rule, the house was transformed into a shrine to Hitler as the town drew in a wave of tourists.

""We were [rehearsing] in the tent for about a week and a half, then we had to move to bigger studios in Hollywood where we are working on the rest of the show,"" she told Houston radio station Mix 96.5. ""And then we will send that equipment to Houston where we will finish rehearsals. Fans can expect a performance that spans my career so far."" She has a high standard to live up to - notably Prince's show in 2007, which took place in the middle of a Miami thunderstorm and is widely accepted as the greatest performance in the event's history, if not Prince's career. Here are some of the other most memorable - and surprising - moments from the last 30 years. Super Bowl performers get a very strict 12-minute time limit, so most performers cram their set with as much music as possible. Not Michael Jackson. After shooting onto the stage at the Pasadena Rose Bowl, he stood completely still, staring at the world for a full 90 seconds. Ninety. It was a master class in ratcheting expectation to a fever pitch. And the screams when he launched into Jam (not one of his best songs) proved he knew what he was doing. Brilliantly, Jackson staged this entire performance while wearing a jacket it looked like he'd borrowed from Muammar Gaddafi. Beat that, Gaga. Baby, he was born to run... and slide on his knees... and crotch slam a TV camera. In his autobiography, The Boss explains the incident like this: ""Too much adrenalin, a late drop, too much speed, here I come, Mikeâ€¦ BOOM! ""And I'm onto his camera, the lens implanted into my chest with one leg off the stage. I use his camera to push myself back up andâ€¦ BLAM! BORN TO RUN!"" It led to the memorable headline: ""America Attacked by Bruce Springsteen's crotch"" - but it didn't stop the star delivering one of the most powerful and energetic Super Bowl shows in recent history. Even if they were fined for over-running by 40 seconds. Coldplay were the headline act at last year's Super Bowl in Santa Clara - but someone forgot to tell Beyonce. She only performed one song, Formation, underscoring its message of black pride and power with back-up dancers dressed in leather body suits and black berets reminiscent of the Black Panthers movement. Some of her dancers were even pictured holding up a sign declaring ""Justice 4 Mario Woods"" - a 26-year-old black man who was shot dead by armed police in San Francisco two months earlier. The performance heralded the arrival of her unapologetically political album, Lemonade, later in the year.

""All the children, orphaned for one reason or another, absolutely loved the hats and balloons."" Prince Harry was supporting the charity Sentebale which assists projects that work with disadvantaged children, many of whom have Aids or have become orphans because of the disease. He was also photographed participating in the building of Mamohato Children's Centre. This will give emotional and psychological support to young people affected by HIV and Aids. The prince visited a Mamohato Network Club in Maseru and said: ""These are children who have never had the chance to talk about their illness, and who had no idea that they were one of so many in their age group.

pegasus,Ricky Burns is a man on a mission.,"With three defeats in his previous six bouts, the Scottish boxer's career seemed to be on the wane. But his power, timing and focus returned in a supremely confident display at Glasgow's Hydro on Saturday night as he clinched the vacant WBA World Super-Lightweight title - and entered the record books as the first Scot to win world titles at three weights. Italy's Michele Di Rocco, at 34 a year older than Burns, hadn't lost a fight since September 2007. He arrived with a record of 40 wins and a draw from 42 bouts. He left a lesser figure. The referee deemed the man from Assisi to be in no state to continue in the eighth round, the result of a welter of blows to his head and body and made all the more unbearable by the hostile acoustic energy generated by 8,000 Scottish fans. Surely, for Burns, this was time to shout about his record, the ideal moment to counter all those who had written him off and questioned the wisdom of him leaving trainer Billy Nelson two years ago to work with Tony Sim in Essex? No. Instead, the champion spoke of his disbelief at the ease of his victory, his gratitude that he was safe, of his thanks to promoter Eddie Hearn, manager Alex Morrison and coach Sim for believing in him, and of his desire to celebrate with a fast-food burger and 20 chicken nuggets. ""When I got in the ring after the fight, I said, 'You've done it! You've done it!',"" reported a beaming Hearn at the post-fight media conference. ""And you know what Ricky said? 'Can you get a picture with me and Michael Buffer [the legendary American boxing ring announcer]?'"" When he has time to reflect during a well-earned holiday, Burns will take immense satisfaction at being only the third British-born fighter, after Bob Fitzsimmons and Duke McKenzie, to be a three-weight world champion. In Scottish terms, his achievements must mean that he is in the very top tier of boxing greats, comfortably mentioned in the same breath as former world champions Benny Lynch, Walter McGowan, Jackie Paterson, Ken Buchanan and Jim Watt, for example. Burns' record stands at 40 wins from 46 bouts. Remarkably, 11 of those have been world title fights. Buchanan's exploits in the United States add lustre to his legacy, but while Burns may never have fought someone like Roberto Duran, should Hearn manage to set up a bout against Cincinnati's Adrien Broner, the four-time world champion stripped of the WBA title because he could not make the weight, then Burns could achieve little more in the sport. ""There are some big fights out there for me,"" said Burns. ""I want to fight the top names. I will fight anybody. I do super-lightweight comfortably and lightweight is still an option. I would fight Terence Crawford again if it came down to it. ""That's nearly two years I have been with Tony and things have just started clicking. ""I had a bit of a bad run in the last year with stuff.",1,4,2

Following on, he then made 68 in Surrey's 166-3 to keep Hampshire at bay and prompt handshakes at 16:50 BST. The draw sees third-placed Hampshire claim 12 points, while Surrey take 10 points and stay sixth in Division One. Burns' epic effort saw him stay in the field for all but 10 overs of the entire match, as he defied Hampshire's bowling efforts on a flat Oval pitch. The left-hander was dropped twice in the slip cordon in his career-best 219, but was the only one to resist as Ian Holland (3-37) dismissed Tom Curran (53), Amar Virdi and Mark Footitt to force the follow-on after Surrey began the day on 410-7. Mark Stoneman (47) and Burns then put on an opening stand of 109 before Holland's medium pace had Stoneman lbw and Scott Borthwick bowled in a single over. Sean Ervine became the only man to dismiss Burns in 756 minutes of play when he missed a ball down the leg side, but Jason Roy and Dominic Sibley continued on until the conclusion. Surrey captain Rory Burns told BBC Radio London: ""I'm really pleased that we've fought that hard to get the draw and the extra five points, and obviously pretty happy with how I've played. ""We had to bat seven sessions to get us to safety and that's all I was thinking. ""There were some jitters in the nineties and I got a lifeline, which was quite nice. When I was getting close to 200, I was more thinking about the situation of getting to the follow-on mark. ""They're a good side and they played really well. We managed to hold on and get ourselves to safety, so it was honours even on a flat wicket.""",1,5,3

Analysis by Vitaliy Shevchenko, BBC Monitoring The decision was made following two separate court rulings, which said the websites ""spread pornography"". Sexually explicit content is not outlawed in Russia, but the law bans ""the illegal production, dissemination and advertisement of pornographic materials and objects"". It is not uncommon for Russia to ban websites. The government agency Roskomnadzor maintains a blacklist that now includes thousands of them. Access is usually blocked for violating the notoriously vague extremism legislation or child protection laws. Websites critical of the Kremlin have been blocked too, and at one point Wikipedia was blacklisted. Following the 2015 ban, one woman asked Roskomnadzor on Twitter whether it could recommend an alternative. The agency replied: ""You can meet someone in real life."" On Tuesday, it said its earlier tweet was ""still relevant"". However, open rights campaigners have warned that local bans can be defeated. ""Blocking porn is the fastest way to ensure widespread adoption of censorship circumvention in your country,"" said Eva Galperin, global policy analyst at the Electronic Frontier Foundation. One of the affected porn sites offered Roskomnadzor a premium subscription to its service, in exchange for lifting the ban. The government agency said it was ""not in the market"" for such an offer.

The system would appoint a named person - usually a teacher or health visitor - to ensure the wellbeing of every child. But judges at the UK's highest court ruled against the scheme in July 2016, citing concerns over information sharing. The Supreme Court judges said some proposals breached rights to privacy and a family life under the European Convention on Human Rights. However, the court said the aim of the Act, which is intended to promote and safeguard the rights and wellbeing of children and young people, was legitimate. Speaking ahead of his statement to the Scottish Parliament, Mr Swinney said the Scottish government remained ""absolutely committed"" to the Named Person service as a way to support children and their families. ""Last year the Supreme Court ruled definitively that the intention of providing a Named Person for every child to promote and safeguard their wellbeing was 'unquestionably legitimate and benign',"" he said.

""I will now update parliament on the next steps in this vital means of supporting, safeguarding and promoting the wellbeing of our children and young people."" The judges said in July that specific proposals about information-sharing were ""not within the legislative competence of the Scottish Parliament"". And they said the legislation made it ""perfectly possible"" that confidential information about a young person could be disclosed to a ""wide range of public authorities without either the child or young person or her parents being aware"". The appeal was brought by the No to Named Persons (NO2NP) coalition, which includes the Christian Institute, Care (Christian Action Research and Education), Tyme Trust and the Family Education Trust.

pegasus,Scotland's national sporting body says it is facing a 20% cut in funding over the next three years.,"sportscotland says it has yet to decide where the cuts will fall amid concerns that elite athletes could suffer. The cuts are being blamed on reduced government spending and a drop in National Lottery ticket sales - a major contributor to sports backing. Governing bodies are bracing themselves for potential job losses. About 60% of funding is made up from Scottish Government money, with lottery sales making up the rest. In the year ending 2015, total revenue was £65.1m, which is divided up and awarded to 52 sports. By the end of next year, that figure will have fallen to £51.8m - a cut to the Scottish sporting budget of 20% in just three years. sportscotland chairman Mel Young said: ""It's heartbreaking to me because I know the effort the sport governing bodies and the community that's around it; the volunteers and the mums and dads. ""And, to have to say that we're having to cut some money back is, I believe, not the right way to go."" Former badminton player Susan Egelstaff, a double bronze medallist at the Commonwealth Games [in 2002 and 2006] and an Olympian, fears the cuts will have ""a huge impact"". ""What that means in the future is that Scotland will be constantly playing catch-up,"" she said. ""It's almost impossible to catch up if you fall too far behind the leading nations."" The Scottish Government said sport and physical activity play a ""key role"" in a healthy Scotland and that ""significant"" investment would continue in those areas. ""Having successfully delivered the Commonwealth Games [in 2014] we are now focusing on protecting or raising investment in areas intended to decrease health inequality and improve life chances, and the small reduction in the sport budget allows us to support those priorities,"" Minister for Sport Aileen Campbell said. ""There is on-going support for active lifestyles through capital investment in cycling and walking, and over the last 10 years we have invested £168m in sport infrastructure - from grassroots to the elite performance which has increased the facilities and opportunities to get people active and achieve on the world stage at both the Olympics and Commonwealth Games.""",1,5,4

The council said it would bring staff in line with the other 17,000 workers and ""reduce the risk"" of staff making claims for equal pay. Union Unison said it was ""bitterly disappointed"" with the decision. Regional officer, Helen Metcalf, said: ""This is a devastating blow for the 2,700 teaching assistants in the county, who now face being driven into poverty and relying on food banks through losing Â£200 - Â£400 per month of their salary.""

Teaching assistant Tony Lowery, said: ""It is really devastating for my family because I'm the main wager. I don't mean things like going on holidays or a second car, I mean things like food on the table and clothes on our backs."" Liberal Democrat councillors voted unanimously against the plans. Councillor Owen Temple said the affected staff would ""find themselves the poorest teaching assistants in the North East"" and the council was ""very likely to face legal challenge"".

pegasus,The US Supreme Court has ruled in favour of President Barack Obama's signature healthcare law.,"In a 6-3 decision, the justices said that tax subsidies that make health insurance affordable for low-income individuals can continue. The ruling preserves the law known as Obamacare, which Mr Obama considers a major part of his presidential legacy. Republicans have vowed to continue fighting the law. ""We've got more work to do, but what we're not going to do is unravel what has now been woven into the fabric of America,"" Mr Obama said. The case, known as King v Burwell, was the second major challenge the law has faced in the US's highest court. Unlike in many other western countries, the US does not have a single-payer healthcare system. Private companies, rather than the US government, provide health insurance for US citizens. The enactment of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) - one of Mr Obama's most significant and controversial domestic achievements - in 2010 mandated that every American had to purchase private insurance. It provided the subsidies to allow many to do so. In 2012, the mandate portion of the law was challenged in the court. The justices ruled to preserve it. In that decision, as in the decision on Thursday, Chief Justice John Roberts surprised observers by siding with his liberal colleagues in support of the law. ""Congress passed the Affordable Care act to improve health insurance markets, not to destroy them,"" Chief Justice John Roberts wrote in the opinion. Justice Anthony Kennedy dissented in 2012, but sided with the majority on Thursday. Had the court made the opposite decision, an estimated 8.7 million people in the US would have been at risk of losing the aid that makes healthcare affordable. The stakes could not have been higher. People's health (crucially important) and Obama's legacy (less important, but for him and those around him fairly vital) were at stake. Well a politically finely balanced Supreme Court has given an emphatic, overwhelming vote in favour of the president by 6-3. I bet ""No-drama Obama"" is high-fiving anyone and everyone in the White House - that is how big it is. Obama defies lame-duck expectations Demonstrators gathered outside the court as early on Thursday morning. Reading updates on their mobile phones, the crowd became jubilant when they learned mid-morning that the court had ruled in their favour. Some began dancing, while others chanted ""If you're covered and you know it clap your hands."" ""This is a big sigh of relief for millions across the country,"" said Ron Pollack of Families USA, a health-care advocacy organisation. ""The ACA is not just the law of the land, it will remain the law of the land"". ""Today is a good day for healthcare in America,"" said activist Benton Strong. ""I hope this is the end of the line."" Demonstrators opposing the subsidies did not have a large visible presence. Justice Antonin Scalia wrote in his dissent that the Supreme Court is setting a precedent of favouring some laws over others. ""We should start calling this law Scotuscare"" Justice Scalia wrote, referring to the court's acronym. ""Today's interpretation is not merely unnatural; it is unheard",1,5,4
pegasus,The Vatican is holding up the appointment of a French ambassador to the Holy See.,"The French government proposed senior diplomat Laurent Stefanini for the post in January but the Vatican is yet to respond to approve the choice. The Vatican usually responds within six weeks to approve such a new ambassador. The nomination of Mr Stefanini was seen as a litmus test for Pope Francis, who has taken a more liberal stance on homosexuality. A French government spokesman said there had been negotiations with the Vatican over the appointment. ""France has chosen its ambassador to the Vatican. This choice was Stefanini and that remains the French proposal,"" said spokesman Stephane Le Foll. Observers say most Vatican appointments are confirmed within six weeks and that this long silence should be read as a rejection. The Vatican traditionally makes no statement if it intends to decline a nomination. Mr Stefanini served in the Holy See as a deputy ambassador in the French embassy from 2001 to 2005. He was described by the country's foreign ministry as ""one of our best diplomats"". France legalised same-sex marriage in 2013, despite opposition from the Catholic Church. Pope Francis is regarded as more tolerant of homosexuality than previous popes. ""Who am I to judge?"", he said in 2013.",1,5,3

pegasus,The decline of one of the world's rarest species of gibbon has been explained by old Chinese government records.,"Today, China has between 26 and 28 Hainan gibbons left, but government records that date back to the 17th Century show that gibbons were once widespread across half of the country. The apes began to disappear from the documents about 150 years ago, corresponding with population growth. The study is published in the Proceedings of the Royal Society B. Hainan gibbons are now limited to a few isolated patches of forest in the south west of China. They live in just four social groups, one of which was only discovered a few weeks ago. Understanding this population crash has been difficult, but the old government documents have helped to reveal when and how the numbers fell. Dr Sam Turvey, from the Zoological Society of London, said: ""China is one of the few places in the world that has a very very rich, long historical record. ""Because it has had such a complex bureaucracy for so long, there has been a lot of need for reporting - not just numbers of households for tax purposes and things like that, but also in terms of the kinds of natural resources that were available in the immediate environment."" These included records of animals, including gibbons, he said. ""We looked at the pattern of disappearance of gibbons through time and how that varied from place to place and the different environmental conditions and human pressures that were also present in these places."" The archives show that gibbons were a common sight in about 20 provinces in China well into the 17th and 18th Century. However, Dr Turvey said it was ""a stark contrast to their very imperilled position today"". ""We see a really steep increase in population decline and real population collapse across China about 100-150 years ago,"" he added. ""And this correlates with demographic expansion in China towards the end of the Imperial era and through the 20th Century, and the massive increase in deforestation and human population growth through the time of the Chinese Republic and the establishment of the communist party."" The researchers said a better understanding of the animals' decline would help them to establish a conservation plan for the country's last few Hainan gibbons. Dr Turvey said: ""It is an incredible privilege to be able to see gibbons in China in the wild. ""The Hainan gibbon is such as rare species, but knowing that this species is still hanging on there gives you hope that conservation will be able to bring that population back from the brink.""

pegasus,"The director of the Marie Stopes abortion clinic in Belfast, Dawn Purvis, is to step down.","It is the first private clinic to offer early medical abortions to women in Northern Ireland under strict legal controls. A former leader of the Progressive Unionist Party, Ms Purvis has been director of the clinic since it was launched in 2012. Ms Purvis, who will step down on 24 April, said it was ""time to move on"". She will take on a new role on the clinic's Northern Ireland advisory board. Last November, anti-abortion protester Bernadette Smyth, who leads the Precious Life group, was convicted of harassing Ms Purvis at the Marie Stopes office in Belfast city centre. Ms Purvis told the BBC that had had no influence on her decision to step down. ""I think the clinic's well established here now, we're providing services more and more every year and I'm delighted to be remaining on the advisory board for the clinic. ""But I feel it's time to move on and I think it's time for Marie Stopes to get someone else in to manage the clinic and take it to new places,"" she said. ""At times it was difficult, particularly last year with the court case and the harassment, but I put that behind me and have concentrated on delivering services for women in Ireland both north and south. ""I think I've achieved a significant historical change in the perception of abortion in Northern Ireland from where the usual narrative was that abortion was illegal in Northern Ireland to now one where people understand that abortion is legal under certain circumstances. ""I think we've challenged the myths and stereotypes that are presented by those who are opposed to a woman's right to chose."" Genevieve Edwards, director of policy for Marie Stopes UK, said: ""We were so lucky to have Dawn and wish her every success in whatever she chooses to do.

pegasus,The inquest into the murders of 11 Protestant workmen by loyalist paramilitaries has been delayed until next year because of a lack of a coroner.,"Republicans ambushed a mini-bus carrying the men at Kingsmill in County Armagh in 1976 and murdered them after checking what religion they were. Senior coroner John Leckey is retiring this year and told a preliminary hearing of the inquest in Belfast that no replacement has been appointed. His retirement could leave only one coroner in Northern Ireland. Kingsmill is among dozens of inquests dating from the early days of the Troubles that face delay because not enough money is available to investigate or there is nobody to oversee fresh hearings. Mr Leckey said: ""I feel for the bereaved families, not exclusively Kingsmill but for other inquests I am involved in. ""It is a disappointment that is widespread."" A lawyer for some of the Kingsmill victims' families said they would be pressing Stormont's justice department for more resources to allow an inquest to go ahead. Karen Armstrong, a sister of one of the murdered men, said the lack of resources was ""a political problem"". ""We are not going to lie down and accept it,"" she said. ""We will fight until we get another date and they have to make sure there are enough coroners in Northern Ireland to deal with our and many other cases."" Ulster Unionist MLA Danny Kennedy said he would be asking Justice Minister David Ford to ensure the matter was referred to the relevant authorities so that ""action can be taken as soon as possible"". ""Justice has been denied for almost 40 years and it is totally unacceptable that this inquest should be delayed further due to the unavailability of a coroner,"" he said. ""This was one of the most shocking and cruel events of the Troubles and the inquest must be treated with the seriousness this crime merits."" A Department of Justice spokesman said: ""Officials are actively working to ensure that all necessary resources are provided for the conduct of inquests in Northern Ireland. ""There are currently three full-time coroners in Northern Ireland. In addition, one High Court judge and one County Court judge have also been appointed as coroners.""",1,5,4

He had previously opposed an assisted dying law, but said his illness has left him ""like a beached whale"" and in constant discomfort. ""My position has changed,"" he wrote to Baroness D'Souza. Stage and TV actor Lord Rix, who specialised in post-war ""Whitehall farce"" comedies, is receiving 24-hour care in a retirement home. ""My position has changed. As a dying man, who has been dying now for several weeks, I am only too conscious that the laws of this country make it impossible for people like me to be helped on their way, even though the family is supportive of this position and everything that needs to be done has been dealt with. ""Unhappily, my body seems to be constructed in such a way that it keeps me alive in great discomfort when all I want is to be allowed to slip into a sleep, peacefully, legally and without any threat to the medical or nursing profession.

""Only with a legal euthanasia Bill on the statute books will the many people who find themselves in the same situation as me be able to slip away peacefully in their sleep instead of dreading the night.""

He has been a prominent campaigner for people with learning disabilities after his daughter was born with Down's syndrome.

He had discussed with his children the possibility of travelling to the Dignitas clinic in Switzerland, but felt it would be ""unfair to them to push them into a situation where they are helping me to die"". Lord Rix said he had not been given an estimate from doctors as to how long he will live, adding: ""I think it's wrong that people like me are stranded like this.

pegasus,"The liquidators of department store chain BHS are expected to decide this week whether to sell the business as a going concern. Like Sir Philip Green, 71-year-old John Hargreaves also enjoys the life of the super.","BHS entered administration in April. Since then, efforts have been continuing to rescue it from closure and save the jobs of its 11,000 staff. Last week, a surprise late bid led by retail veteran Greg Tufnell transformed the race to acquire the retailer. His team, said to be backed by Portuguese money, is the front-runner. But if a deal cannot be struck, the business may still have to be liquidated. The remaining bidders have faded into the background. Another consortium led by Matalan tycoon John Hargreaves and Turkish retail entrepreneur Cafer Mahiroglu has reportedly run into difficulties, while other suitors have apparently failed to impress with their proposals. Some of those involved in the different bids have impressive retailing histories. But then Sir Philip Green, who controlled BHS from 2000 to 2015, also had a brilliant track record. And he ended up selling the business for Â£1. So what are the chances of saving BHS from the liquidators? And just who are the people aiming to do it? In the public eye, Greg Tufnell is easily overshadowed by his more famous brother Phil, the former England cricketer. But that could change if his bid for BHS is successful, because he hopes to become the firm's next chairman. And as far as his credentials for the job are concerned, the 54-year-old executive certainly talks the talk. He describes himself as ""a highly experienced managing director with Mothercare and Arcadia, a blend of entrepreneur, strategist and hands-on operator with significant commercial business turnaround, acquisition and fund-raising experience"". His record shows that he was buying and merchandising director at Next from 1991 to 1994. He then spent three years as managing director of menswear retailer Burton, part of the Arcadia group, followed by another three years as managing director of Mothercare. He currently appears to occupy a portfolio of different jobs, including the chairmanships of leather accessories brand Zatchels and recruitment consultancy hga Group. Earlier this month, he registered a new firm, Richess Group, at Companies House. Its other directors are Nick de Scossa, a Swiss banker, and Lisbon-based entrepreneur Jose Maria Soares Bento. Until Mr Tufnell's bid turned up, many observers had assumed that BHS would be snapped up by Matalan founder Mr Hargreaves. But it appears that the cost of a deal may have proved too high. Sources say Mr Hargreaves was asked to improve his offer and balked. Like Sir Philip Green, 71-year-old John Hargreaves also enjoys the life of the super-rich. He has an estimated fortune of Â£1bn, according to the Sunday Times Rich List. But in stark contrast to the ebullient Sir Philip, Mr Hargreaves is described by industry insiders as quiet-spoken, someone who shuns the limelight. Mr Hargreaves is no longer directly involved in the business he founded. He sold his 69% stake in Matalan in 2000, then in 2006 took it private through Missouri Bidco, a company 53.5% owned by him and his family.

The couple spoke out in response to consultation on proposed reform of sentencing for driving offences. They believe increased sentences should be backed up by manslaughter charges. Mr Moores, 28, was killed by a Vauxhall Astra driven by Donna Hackett on the M4 near Swindon. Hackett, then aged 26, fled and was found by police asleep in a ditch. She served half of a six-year jail term after she was found guilty of causing death by careless driving while drunk. The Ministry of Justice consultation suggests offenders who cause death by careless driving while under the influence of drink or drugs could soon be handed a life sentence - an increase on the current 14-year upper limit. Source: Crown Prosecution Service But Mr and Mrs Moores, from Chandlers Ford, Hampshire, also want the offence to be upgraded to a charge of manslaughter. Mr Moores said: ""Somebody can drive drunk and kill my son. Why is that not manslaughter? ""Nothing can prepare a parent for seeing their child in the mortuary. That will stay with me every day, every day that vision comes into my mind. ""Our life is ruined."" Mrs Moores added: ""There's nothing careless about drink driving. I don't want anybody else to feel like us."" Ms Hackett, who lived in Radnor Street, Swindon, at the time of the offence, appealed against her sentence in September 2011, but was refused. A Ministry of Justice spokesperson said: ""We are determined to make sure those who kill whilst driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs face the full force of the law. ""That is why we are consulting on plans that will see the maximum sentence for a number of offences in this area increase from 14 years to life.""

The city was rocked by riots in April when a black man died after suffering injuries in police custody. Six officers were charged over the death of the 25-year-old, Freddie Gray. Speaking at a news conference on Wednesday, Mayor Rawlings-Blake said Mr Batts had ""served this city with distinction"" since becoming police chief in October 2012. But referring to the city's high homicide rate, she said ""too many continue to die"". ""The focus has been too much on the leadership of the department and not enough on the crime fighting,"" she told reporters, adding: ""We need to get the crime surge under control."" The city has seen a sharp increase in violence since Freddie Gray's death on 19 April, with 155 homicides this year, a 48% increase over the same period last year. On Tuesday, the police department announced that an outside organisation will review its response to the civil unrest that followed Mr Gray's death. The US justice department is also conducting a civil rights review of the Baltimore force and Mr Batts has been criticised by the city's police union. Earlier on Wednesday, the union released its report into the police handling of the rioting. It said officers had complained ""that they lacked basic riot equipment, training, and, as events unfolded, direction from leadership"". The report also said ""officers repeatedly expressed concern that the passive response to the civil unrest had allowed the disorder to grow into full scale rioting"". Recent events had ""placed attention on police leadership"", Ms Rawlings-Blake said, but denied her decision was influenced by the union report. Mr Davis, who is taking over immediately as interim police chief, praised his ""friend"" Mr Batts and said he was a ""true reform commissioner"".

The group has warned that 750 more foster carers are ""urgently"" needed to meet the demands of the care system. It urged people to ""open their hearts and homes"" to vulnerable youngsters. Currently, more than 5,500 children are in foster care in Scotland, living with 4,400 families and carers. The Fostering Network surveyed 250 children, teenagers and foster carers across Scotland and discovered that many young people had failed to find stability. Almost half were already living with their third family, a quarter were with their fourth family and about 20 were living with their 10th family since going into care. There was a particular need for homes to be found for vulnerable teenagers, siblings and disabled children, the study found. Carla, 23, was taken into care at the age of 12 and had eight foster homes before moving in with the Randalls. ""Looking back now I realised that the Randalls saved my life,"" she said. ""I never understood the extent of the neglect and abuse I had endured until I came to live with a 'normal' loving family. ""They were just always themselves, the smallest details meant so much to me. ""They nurtured a young, angry, untrusting teenager to become a positive, empathetic and successful young woman."" The Fostering Network said instability had a detrimental effect on the child's education and wellbeing, while finding a stable foster carer from the outset could lead to improved relationships and a happier childhood. Sara Lurie, director of the Fostering Network Scotland, said: ""As each year passes, we see more and more children coming into care. ""We need people who can open their heart, and their homes, to vulnerable children and young people and use their skills to help support them to reach their full potential. ""In particular we need people who have the skills, patience and passion to look after teenagers who may have had a really tough time and be facing some real challenges, and to offer them love, stability and security. ""A good foster carer will believe in the ambition of the children in their care in the same way they'd believe in the ambition of their biological family members."" Apologies for the delay, see below as requested. A Scottish government spokeswoman said: ""Giving young people security is paramount and we have done a great deal of work with our partners across local government and the third sector to improve how we intervene early when there is a problem within families to find appropriate solutions quickly.

pegasus,To Kill a Mockingbird is one of the most famous books in the world.,"Harper Lee's classic was published 50 years ago this summer and it remains the only novel she ever wrote. Lee, 84, has never explained why she stopped writing. She doesn't give interviews - ""Hell, no"" was her response to a request several decades ago - and that silence has only added to the intrigue. But her close friend Thomas Lane Butts, a retired minister in her hometown, Monroeville, Alabama, says she once told him the reason. Sitting on a pew in the Methodist church which the Lee family still attends, he described to me how she suddenly brought the subject up one night over dinner in New York. ""She asked me, 'You ever wonder why I didn't write anything else?' And I said, 'Along with several million other people, yes, I had wondered about that.' And she said, 'Well, what do you think?'"" Speaking in his slow southern drawl, the Rev Butts, who just turned 80, suggested to her that she had already written a great book and therefore didn't need to compete with herself. ""And when I got through she said, 'You're all wrong.' I said, 'Alright, smart Alec. You tell me.' She said, 'I would not go through all the deprivation of privacy through which I went for this book again for any amount of money.' ""And she said, 'I did not need to write another book. I said what I wanted to say in that book.'"" Harper Lee called it a simple tale about the ""conflict of the human soul"" and Monroeville, Alabama, is where she drew her inspiration. The story depicts the segregated South of her childhood, during the Depression. It was published at the height of the civil rights struggle. The Rev Butts grew up 10 miles outside Monroeville. By the late 1950s, he says, he was a ""fuzzy-cheeked young preacher"" campaigning for an end to segregation. He had met Martin Luther King Jr and signed a petition to boycott buses. The Ku Klux Klan had left a burning cross on his front lawn. He says To Kill a Mockingbird was not well received in Monroeville when it was published. ""The people who were hard racist did not like it because of the implication of the book,"" the Rev Butts told me. ""The book revealed racism and that always frightens a racist - when you pull the cover off them. ""Those of us who stood up for civil rights were much encouraged by the book because in a very skilful and subtle way it addressed itself for justice."" But these days, the Rev Butts says, there is enormous civic pride in Monroeville. The old courthouse, which Hollywood re-created for the film, now houses a museum to Harper Lee and the town's other literary icon, Truman Capote. Capote was a childhood friend of hers and is thought to be the inspiration for the Dill character in To Kill a Mockingbird. The town's residents often try to protect Lee, allowing her to live a normal life instead of being hounded by fans or bothered with prying questions. ""Being famous",1,5,4

Ofsted's report said governors, managers and teachers had developed a ""culture of low expectations"", while leaders had failed to act decisively to halt the decline in pupils' achievement. There was, however, some praise for the acting head teacher. Inspectors said he had introduced a number of improvement measures and some were ""beginning to have an impact"". A report on Lakeside School highlighted similar concerns, criticising teachers for not sufficiently challenging pupils and for having ""over generous"" predictions of their achievement. Inspectors said many pupils, whether high achievers or those with special educational needs, were ""not making the progress they should"" and achievements at GCSE were well below the national average. Governors were also criticised for not holding leaders to account, while the report said management had failed to effectively monitor either pupils or teachers. Inspectors, did however highlight new initiatives to improve literacy which they said were ""beginning to have a positive impact"".",1,5,4

It was sent to UKIP's national executive committee (NEC) before a row over racial slurs about a Labour MP, for which Ms Brown apologised. But UKIP chairman Paul Oakden said the letter did not follow proper process. A UKIP assembly group spokesman said the letter was written by a group with a ""long-standing grudge"" against the AM. The ruling NEC body discussed the issue at a meeting on Friday, where they also decided to allow a controversial anti-Islam campaigner to run for the UKIP leadership. Mr Oakden said: ""A member of the NEC had contacted the person that is putting this forward and said to them they need to follow the proper process of completing the necessary forms and submitting them to the NEC. ""Members simply emailing the NEC saying we want you to do this is not the correct disciplinary process for the party, by any stretch of the imagination. ""A member of the NEC has gone back and given advice on what they need to do."" Shaun Owen, secretary of UKIP's Delyn branch, wrote to the NEC saying: ""For some time we have been appalled by the abrasive and discourteous manner of Ms Brown towards UKIP locally. ""Her lack of effort in pursuing the aims of the party both locally and nationally is of concern to members across the region."" Mr Owen added he believed members would stop supporting UKIP if Ms Brown remained in the role. However, a spokesman for the party's assembly group dismissed the letter as written by a ""tiny and insignificant group"". In February, Ms Brown denied an allegation she had smoked recreational drugs in a hotel room. Later that month, she said she had acted ""with propriety"" after it was revealed she had discussed how an advert for a job in her assembly office could be changed to help her brother get an interview for the post. Meanwhile, UKIP's NEC confirmed that 11 hopefuls in the contest to succeed Paul Nuttall as leader will be able to run as candidates. The list includes Anne Marie Waters, the founder of the Sharia Watch pressure group, who has described Islam as evil.

pegasus,US President Barack Obama has criticised David Cameron's handling of the Libya intervention.,"Speaking to the Atlantic magazine, he said the operation went as well as he had hoped, but Libya was now ""a mess"". The article also said he had warned the PM the UK would have to pay its ""fair share"" and spend 2% of GDP on defence. In response, Number 10 said there were ""many difficult challenges"" in Libya, while the White House said it deeply valued the UK's contributions. Downing Street did not comment on President Obama's remark to the PM about defence spending, reportedly made before Chancellor George Osborne said the government would fulfil a Nato pledge to spend 2% of national income on defence last year. In response to the interview, a spokesman for the US National Security Council said Mr Cameron had been ""as close a partner as the president has had"" adding that ""we deeply value the UK's contributions on our shared national security and foreign policy objectives"". BBC North America editor Jon Sopel said the unsolicited statement put out by the White House suggested Downing Street had reacted angrily to the article. ""It's like we've seen a curtain drawn back on the unspun thoughts of President Obama, complete with frustration as well, and what we've seen tonight is the White House trying to close the curtain as quickly as it can,"" he added. The toppling of the Gaddafi regime in Libya - following UN-backed air strikes designed to protect civilians - led to a power vacuum and instability, with no authority in full control. The intervention was led by the UK and France - and in his interview, Mr Obama reflects on ""what went wrong"", saying: ""There's room for criticism, because I had more faith in the Europeans, given Libya's proximity, being invested in the follow-up."" Mr Cameron, he said, became ""distracted by a range of other things"". He also criticised former French President Nicolas Sarkozy, saying he had tried to claim the spotlight. The former French president, he said, ""wanted to trumpet the flights he was taking in the air campaign, despite the fact that we had wiped out all the air defences and essentially set up the entire infrastructure"" for the intervention. President Obama said the intervention ""averted large-scale civilian casualties (and) prevented what almost surely would have been a prolonged and bloody civil conflict"". But he added: ""And despite all that, Libya is a mess."" He also criticised what he called ""free riders"" in the interview, saying European and Gulf countries were calling for action against Gaddafi, adding: ""But what has been a habit over the last several decades in these circumstances is people pushing us to act but then showing an unwillingness to put any skin in the game."" Despite efforts to support Libya's National Transitional Council, and the first elections in the country for decades, it rapidly descended into violence, with two rival governments and the formation of hundreds of militias, some allied to so-called Islamic State. In January, Mr Cameron told MPs the ""Libyan people were given the opportunity"" to build a stable democracy - and it was a matter",1,5,4

The permit does not allow the company to carry out fracking - hydraulic fracturing of the land - to extract any oil or gas. Fracking is subject to a temporary ban in Wales until decision-making powers on the practice are devolved. Natural Resources Wales said it had carried out a ""thorough assessment"" of the company's plans before approving them, with all work including reinstatement of the land to be completed within 12 months. ""It's important that any activity of this kind doesn't harm the environment, and this permit makes it clear what Coastal Oil and Gas Limited will need to do to comply with this,"" a spokesman said. ""Once the work begins, our officers will regulate and monitor the site to ensure it complies with the conditions of the permit, to protect people and the environment."" The permit for exploratory drilling comes despite a moratorium on fracking in Wales pending devolution of responsibility for such decisions. In August, the UK government urged councils in England to speed up the process of approval for fracking projects. However, Natural Resources Minister Carl Sargeant said fracking technology was ""unproven"", and that Welsh Labour ministers preferred to look at renewable energy.",0,4,3
reference,"""It's all about taking an opportunity in a crisis,"" says the outgoing Conservative leader of Melton Borough Council.","Byron Rhodes is taking me around the modern council headquarters. It's full of light. It's busy. The building has regenerated the area around Melton Mowbray's railway station, once a muddy pot-holed piece of wasteland where those in the know parked for free. Now the council offices link the station to a park and the town centre. It was partly paid for with insurance money after a fire destroyed the old offices on the other side of town. A supermarket moved in to replace it and helped with the money too, putting the council on a firm financial footing. But that was four years ago and the crisis is a different one today. It's being experienced by all local authorities - cuts in central government funding which threaten the services they provide. Mr Rhodes is also deputy leader of Leicestershire County Council, with responsibility for finance. Leicestershire is historically the poorest funded council in the country because of a quirk of Whitehall recalculations, going back a quarter of a century since the poll tax, or community charge, was scrapped. At the moment councils get income from council tax, a share of the business rates, any income they generate themselves from services plus a grant from central government. It's the grant cut which is causing them grief. What's called the ""core funding"" is worked out by the number of homes multiplied by a set amount. And each authority has a different value set per dwelling. If we look at Surrey, which is top of the table, the amount will be £1,686 by 2019/20. Nottinghamshire is mid-table at £1,482, Derbyshire is in the lower reaches with £1,422 per dwelling and then comes Leicestershire at £1,354. ""The funding system is chaotic,"" says Byron Rhodes. ""It doesn't reflect real need. Look at Oxfordshire which is an interesting example,"" he says with a glint in his eye. Could he possibly be referring to the prime ministerial plea to the county council about cutbacks to services there? ""If we had the same funding as Oxfordshire, we'd have £50m a year extra. If we had the same as Surrey, we'd have £100m more. We'd be partying everyday if we had that kind of money."" Leicestershire have been helped with a small share of what's been called transitional funding - about £300m to help councils following pressure from Conservative MPs. Think back to the vote on Sunday trading. With a majority of only 17 in the Commons, the Conservatives lost the vote when 20 odd rebelled. Last month there would've been another rebellion, including some of our own Tory MPs in the East Midlands, if something wasn't done to improve the local government finance settlement over the next four years. The money has gone largely to shire counties. Leicestershire got £6.6m spread over two years, enough to save some services from closure. But it's a drop in the ocean for an authority with a £19m black hole in the budget every year after the latest cutbacks. Labour have protested that 83% of the councils getting transition funding are Conservative-run. Many Labour-run",0,2,2

Archaeologist David Jacques, said: ""They... used the stump of the tree, about three metres high, as a wall."" The finds are being shown to United Nations heritage experts, who are currently visiting Stonehenge. Archaeologists are concerned a planned 2.9km tunnel being considered for the nearby A303 main road will damage the site. Discoveries have also shown stones were warmed up by the Mesolithic Period inhabitants and used in a hearth to emit heat in the earthy snug. Mr Jacques, a senior research fellow at the University of Buckingham, has worked at Blick Mead for over a decade, making a number of discoveries about the inhabitants. The tree stump created a wall height similar to a ""modern bungalow"". ""They've draped probably animal skins or thatch around the basin and connected it to a post so it's a very comfortable snug little place,"" he said. The wooden wall of the hollow was lined with flints and the large earthy pit created by the tree root lined with cobbles and decorated with ""exotic"" stones from outside the area. ""There are some clever and sophisticated things going on, the hot stones that they put into this little type of alcove wouldn't have been on fire,"" explained Mr Jacques. ""It looks more like these people have been using these hot stones as a type of storage heater so that you've got a lot of warmth coming off them."" Mr Jacques will meet the UN experts later to ask for the route to be moved closer to Salisbury and for hydrological assessments to be made. ""It's very likely the water flow would be reduced in and around the site,"" he said. ""It would take out all the organics and destroy all the animal bone we've been finding which is crucial for finding where they have been living and for getting radiocarbon dates from all the organics like pollen and wood. ""This is massively important for reconstructing what the landscape would have looked like."" Andy Rhind-Tutt, former mayor and chairman of Amesbury Museum and Heritage Trust said: ""I sincerely hope the team delivering the long-awaited A303 improvement look seriously at an alternative alignment south of Salisbury and away from this unequalled archaeological landscape. ""It would be criminal to destroy such a rich heritage and connection with our ancestors for the sake of blocking the view to the passing public of Stonehenge.""",0,4,3

reference,A campaign group website says over a million people in the European Union have signed a petition against trade negotiations with the United States.,"The petition calls on the EU and its member states to stop the talks on the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership or TTIP. It also says they should not ratify a similar deal that has already been done between the EU and Canada. It says some aspects pose a threat to democracy and the rule of law. One of the concerns mentioned in the petition is the idea of tribunals that foreign investors would be able to use in some circumstances to sue governments. There is a great deal of controversy over exactly what this system, known as Investor State Dispute Settlement, would enable companies to do, but campaigners see it as an opportunity for international business to get compensation for government policy changes that adversely affect them. This kind of provision exists in many bilateral trade and investment agreements. Friends of the Earth have published new research on the impact they have had on EU countries. Information about these cases is not always made public, but the group says that going back to 1994, foreign investors have sought compensation of almost €30bn (£24bn) from 20 states. Where the results are known (a small minority of the total), the tribunals have awarded total compensation of €3.5bn (about £2.8bn). In Britain, the possible implications of this provision for the National Health Service have been especially controversial. Campaigners believe that the investor tribunals would make it harder to reverse any decisions to contract services out to international healthcare firms. John Hilary of War on Want said: TTIP ""will make it impossible for any future government to repeal the Health & Social Care Act and bring the NHS back into public hands"". The petition lists a number of other areas where its signatories believes European standards would suffer if the TTIP negotiations are completed and the Canada deal is ratified: employment, social, environmental, privacy and consumer protection. The European Commission says the EU will not have to sacrifice its high standards. It also says investor protection provisions are important for investment flows and have in general worked well. But it accepts there is a need for improvement and is trying to achieve that in its bilateral negotiations. The petition has been organised as an exercise called a European Citizens' Initiative which can lead to a public hearing in the European Parliament and require the European Commission to give a formal response explaining why it is accepting or rejecting what the petitioners call for. The European Commission has already said that the petition doesn't qualify as such an Initiative. Campaigners have launched a legal challenge to this decision.",0,4,3

Church warden Liz Cowley said keeping the 11th Century building in good shape was difficult. She said: ""You can see the urine marks (on the altar), they won't go away. ""If people were coming in here damaging an ancient building like this, you would say it was criminal damage. ""The smell is appalling, it's a combination of ammonia from the urine and a musty smell from the droppings that catches at the back of the throat."" Members of the church had spent Â£10,000 trying to get the bats to move and had paid for specially-built lofts nearby.

Last week, Home Secretary Theresa May said MI5 believed an attack on targets in Great Britain by dissident republicans had become ""a strong possibility"". Analysis: Vincent Kearney, BBC News NI's home affairs correspondent The discovery of what appears to be a second dissident republican arms dump near Larne within three months has left police baffled. Based on location alone, the analysis would be that the items found most likely belonged to loyalist paramilitaries. But the nature of what was found suggests otherwise and the finger of suspicion firmly in the direction of dissident republicans. Det Supt Kevin Geddes said the threat level in Northern Ireland from dissident republican groups remains ""severe"" and an attack is ""highly likely"".

Det Supt Geddes said the seizure was significant ""both in terms of its size and its capability"". ""A number of these devices were ready to be deployed,"" he added. ""This seizure has undoubtedly saved lives."" He said the type of weapons that had been found meant police would focus their investigation on dissident republicans.

Buksh will be sentenced on 27 June. The High Court in Glasgow heard that 43-year-old Mrs Buksh died after being struck on the head at least five times. Pathologists told the court that the lack of defensive injuries and the position of her body suggested she was assaulted as she slept. Following the attack, Buksh went to Cathcart Police Station and told an officer: ""I've come to hand myself in. I think my wife's dead. I hit her on the head. I did it."" The court was told that three psychiatrists described Buksh as suffering from an acute stress disorder at the time. Prosecutor Gordon Lamont said: ""The accused and his wife had been married for 25 years, but over the last 10 or 11 years their relationship appears to have broken down and they became increasingly estranged, albeit, still residing under the one roof. ""They slept separately and Mrs Buksh routinely slept on the sofa in the living room. Their children report that they barely spoke to each other."" Mr Lamont said the problems in the marriage intensified after Mrs Buksh went to Pakistan on holiday in May last year. He said she had become involved with another man and was making plans to move to Pakistan. The court also heard that two days before he killed his wife, Buksh went to Paisley Police Office and spoke with a support officer saying he feared his wife was going to take their youngest child, aged 10, to Pakistan and not return. He also made an emergency doctor's appointment and said he was suffering from stress and not sleeping. He was prescribed medication for stress. Defence counsel Sarah Livingstone said: ""My client has no memory of this incident. His amnesia is absolutely genuine. ""This is not a case where this man was a bad husband, there was no domestic abuse. This was an unhappy marriage, but however, unhappy it was it didn't justify killing his wife.

reference,A new law imposing restrictions on users of social media has come into effect in Russia.,"It means bloggers with more than 3,000 daily readers must register with the mass media regulator, Roskomnadzor, and conform to the regulations that govern the country's larger media outlets. Internet companies will also be required to allow Russian authorities access to users' information. One human rights group called the move ""draconian"". The law was approved by Russia's upper house of parliament in April. It includes measures to ensure that bloggers cannot remain anonymous, and states that social networks must maintain six months of data on its users. The information must be stored on servers based in Russian territory, so that government authorities can gain access. Critics see it as the latest in a series of recent moves to curb internet freedom. Hugh Williamson, of New York-based Human Rights Watch, has called the law ""another milestone in Russia's relentless crackdown on free expression"". ""The internet is the last island of free expression in Russia and these draconian regulations are clearly aimed at putting it under government control,"" he added. Opposition figures have used the internet to air their views, with some gaining millions of followers. Commentators opposing Vladimir Putin often face restrictions in broadcast outlets and newspapers. Analysis: Famil Ismailov, news editor, BBCRussian.com Russian bloggers are bracing themselves for the moment when Russia's new ""information security law"" comes into force on 1 August. Some already share advice on how to use proxy servers in order to access social media sites that, in their view, are under threat of being closed. It is hard to see how the law will be enforced. The servers for most of the popular social media platforms that many Russians use are based outside Russia. Many popular bloggers are already looking for, and apparently finding, ways to ""cheat"" the feature that counts page visits and keep their daily unique visitor numbers just under 3000, or to make sure that the statistics are hidden altogether. Anton Nossik, who is considered Russia's ""internet guru"", wrote in his LiveJournal blog that the new law didn't threaten individual bloggers directly, but provided legal grounds to block popular social networks like Facebook, Twitter, LiveJournal and Google. ""The issue of banning all these platforms in Russia is a political one and it will be decided by only one person"", Mr Nossik wrote, with a thinly veiled reference to President Vladimir Putin. Earlier in the year, Russia enacted a law that gave the government powers to block websites without explanation. In March, Moscow blocked the blog of Mr Navalny, along with two news sites and a organisation run by Garry Kasparov - a vocal critic of the Russian government. In a statement, Russia's prosecutor general's office said the blocks were imposed because of the sites' role in helping stage illegal protests. Earlier this week, Twitter blocked access to an anti-Kremlin account that often publishes leaked government documents, following a request by Russia's federal communications agency Roskomnadzor. For many years, Russia had relatively lax internet laws. However Moscow has recently changed its tune, with Mr Putin branding the internet an ongoing ""CIA project"". He also claimed that",1,5,4

Mr Moores, 28, was killed by a Vauxhall Astra driven by Donna Hackett on the M4 near Swindon. Hackett, then aged 26, fled and was found by police asleep in a ditch. She served half of a six-year jail term after she was found guilty of causing death by careless driving while drunk.

State media picked up the story on Thursday, which was first reported in a local evening paper earlier this week. Liaoshen Wanbao reported the 49-year-old woman in Shenyang city had claimed her husband had divorced her 10 years ago because he disliked the shape of her face, said to be ""large and square"" with ""fat cheeks"". She said it spurred her to undergo facial surgery three times at a local hospital to shave her jawbones and reshape her face into a slimmer shape. During the third surgery the doctors discovered that if they proceeded further her nerves may be damaged, and halted the procedure. The woman, identified only by her surname Wang, later sued the hospital for 1.7 million yuan ($260,900; Â£183,900) in damages. She alleged the surgery had left her with soreness in her chin, and she could only eat and drink through a straw as ""when she exerted force on her lower jaw, she had the sensation that it would break"". The hospital, however, argued that the surgeries were conducted according to regulations, and pointed out that they encouraged her to seek psychiatric help instead of a third operation, which she refused. After mediation the woman agreed to accept 20,000 yuan ($3,100, Â£2,200) as compensation, said the report. On Weibo, some condemned the woman's husband, but others also chastised the woman. One top-voted comment read: ""It's purely an excuse, if her face was large then why did he decide to marry her in the first place? If he stopped loving her then he should have just said so."" It continued: ""This woman is also very silly to have believed that her face shape was the real reason for the divorce, she is lying to herself."" Said another Weibo user: ""Even if you had gone for facial surgery and made your face smaller, he would still have found other reasons to divorce you."" One person noted the sharp difference in the compensation amount and voiced suspicions: ""1.7 million was dropped to 20,000, it makes me wonder if she really did have a problem with her jaw."" Still others took the opportunity to crack jokes. ""What an odd reason for divorce! I wonder how square was this woman's square-shaped face? Like a television set? Microwave oven?"" Plastic surgery has long been a hot topic on Weibo. In December, users similarly expressed outrage when a Chinese man took out a newspaper advertisement pleading for his wife to go for plastic surgery. More than seven million cosmetic surgeries were performed in China in 2014. The industry's value, pegged at around 400bn yuan, is expected to double by 2019, according to the China Association of Plastics and Aesthetics.",1,4,4

Senior police official Sateesh Bino told the NDTV news channel that the writer-activist ""is being questioned for his controversial post on the national anthem on Facebook"" and had been charged with sedition. Earlier this month, 12 people were arrested at a cinema in Kerala, after they remained seated while the national anthem played.

Freezing care provider fees to save money was no long sustainable, it said. Ministers say extra money will help NHS and social care services work together. The survey, which was completed by 147 directors of adult social services for councils in England, suggests that funding reductions to social care budgets have totalled £4.6bn since 2010 - a 31% overall reduction. Budgets for adult social care - which provides practical support to people due to illness, disability, old age or a low income - will reduce by a further £500m in cash terms this year, it said. ""Taking the growth in numbers of older and disabled people into account, this means that an additional £1.1bn would be needed to provide the same level of service as last year,"" the report warned. It said some councils had made savings in the past by freezing fees paid to providers, but care providers were now also facing financial problems. Some companies - particularly those in southern England - are struggling to attract staff, amid increasing concern about the quality of care, it said. ""What is at stake is the continuing capacity of adult social care to sustain services to those in greatest need,"" ADASS president Ray James said. ""In virtually all our authorities, the number in need is growing, while the complexity of their needs is increasing."" ADASS called for the government to ""protect essential care and support services to the most vulnerable members of our community"".

The BBC has launched an online guide to the care system for the over-65s. The ""care calculator"" covers residential care and the support provided in people's own homes, for tasks such as washing and dressing. Users can submit their postcode and find out how much each service costs where they live in the UK. There is also a dedicated BBC Cost of Care website, with news stories, analysis and video. The spokesman said: ""Increasing budgets isn't the only solution. By working innovatively and joining up health and social care we can improve care and also save money.""

Ofsted criticised the trust's lack of support to the schools and said each was now considering an alternative sponsor. Inspectors said pupils' achievement at the Phoenix Academy had dropped since it became an academy in 2013 and their latest report rated it inadequate in all areas. A report in 2013, before it converted, rated the secondary school as ""requiring improvement"", while Lakeside was rated ""good"" in 2012 under its former name the Lord Silkin School. In the latest report, inspectors said the curriculum at Phoenix Academy was ""inadequate"", while ""weak teaching"" meant pupils were not sufficiently challenged and were often ""disengaged and disruptive"". There was particular criticism of standards in English and maths which the watchdog said were limiting pupils' achievements in other areas. Ofsted's report said governors, managers and teachers had developed a ""culture of low expectations"", while leaders had failed to act decisively to halt the decline in pupils' achievement. There was, however, some praise for the acting head teacher. Inspectors said he had introduced a number of improvement measures and some were ""beginning to have an impact"". A report on Lakeside School highlighted similar concerns, criticising teachers for not sufficiently challenging pupils and for having ""over generous"" predictions of their achievement. Inspectors said many pupils, whether high achievers or those with special educational needs, were ""not making the progress they should"" and achievements at GCSE were well below the national average. Governors were also criticised for not holding leaders to account, while the report said management had failed to effectively monitor either pupils or teachers.

One signatory, Jenny Lewis, wrote on the first petition: ""[Tutors] Helen Kidd and Tom Sherry are carrying on the great Ruskin tradition of bringing opportunities to those that otherwise would not have them."" Student and activist Saskia Ritchie, who set up the second petition, said Ruskin had been set up for ""people who would traditionally be excluded from academia"" and gives ""access to truly excellent learning opportunities"". Mr Wilkes said the college would lose about 25 students as a result of the cuts. He added degrees had been on offer at the college for about 10 years and were ""relatively new"" considering the college's 116-year history.

At the party's weekly press briefing, I asked the Welsh Conservative leader Andrew RT Davies, who was elected on the list, whether he'd stand as a constituency candidate in his home turf of the Vale of Glamorgan but he said he hadn't thought about it. Presumably those are the kind of decisions they will now feel more confident contemplating. The party will also have a huge amount of new data on voters which it'll be able to call upon and the belief that campaigning hard on the NHS helped the Tories cross the line in places like the Vale of Clwyd and Gower. The Conservatives feel it's them, rather than any of the other opposition parties, who have become the repository of votes from those who are disaffected by the state of the NHS. Welsh Labour are going to hold a ""short sharp"" analysis into what went wrong. Carwyn Jones was in line with most of the criticism of Ed Miliband when he told AMs that the party needed to appeal to small business owners who are not millionaires but who work hard. What will be more difficult is countering the argument on the NHS, which the former minister Alun Davies believes is already lost. Another potential difficulty for Welsh Labour will be dealing with unhappiness within the party over council re-organisation. Bernie Attridge, the deputy leader of Flintshire Council, has tweeted saying the party needs to be careful on local government reform if it wants to retain the support of grassroots councillors. It also seems to have been the case that Labour lost more votes to UKIP than the Conservatives, which is another challenge to overcome. But Labour will at least have the advantage that it will be David Cameron, and not Ed Miliband, carrying out the latest round of public sector cuts that are likely to take effect sooner rather than later. The question is whether Carwyn Jones is going to be able to turn that to his advantage when his own record in government will be under scrutiny. Plaid Cymru's education spokesman, Simon Thomas, also in the party's weekly press briefing, said he believed Leanne Wood could portray herself as an alternative first minister because of the way she emotionally connected with people in the campaign.

The city was rocked by riots in April when a black man died after suffering injuries in police custody. Six officers were charged over the death of the 25-year-old, Freddie Gray. Speaking at a news conference on Wednesday, Mayor Rawlings-Blake said Mr Batts had ""served this city with distinction"" since becoming police chief in October 2012. But referring to the city's high homicide rate, she said ""too many continue to die"". ""The focus has been too much on the leadership of the department and not enough on the crime fighting,"" she told reporters, adding: ""We need to get the crime surge under control."" The city has seen a sharp increase in violence since Freddie Gray's death on 19 April, with 155 homicides this year, a 48% increase over the same period last year. On Tuesday, the police department announced that an outside organisation will review its response to the civil unrest that followed Mr Gray's death. The US justice department is also conducting a civil rights review of the Baltimore force and Mr Batts has been criticised by the city's police union. Earlier on Wednesday, the union released its report into the police handling of the rioting. It said officers had complained ""that they lacked basic riot equipment, training, and, as events unfolded, direction from leadership"". The report also said ""officers repeatedly expressed concern that the passive response to the civil unrest had allowed the disorder to grow into full scale rioting"". Recent events had ""placed attention on police leadership"", Ms Rawlings-Blake said, but denied her decision was influenced by the union report. Mr Davis, who is taking over immediately as interim police chief, praised his ""friend"" Mr Batts and said he was a ""true reform commissioner"".

Brazil's Joao Gomes Junior took silver and South African Cameron van der Burgh was third. ""I'm feeling very good. I'm so, so happy with my displays,"" Peaty said. He was speaking to the BBC after taking part in the 4x100m mixed medley relay final, in which defending champions Britain finished fifth. USA won in a world record time of three minutes 38.56 seconds. Australia took silver, with China and Canada in joint third. It was a different story in his individual race, earlier. Peaty was level with his rivals in the first few strokes before he pulled away after 30 metres. The City of Derby swimmer appeared set to break the world record for a third time in two days, but narrowly fell short. The Briton suggested ""equilibrium"" was key to his successes.

""Under 26 seconds for the second time - only four hundredths of a second off his best time. It was, again, an immense swim."" Karen Pickering, British 2001 world 4x200m freestyle gold medallist We all know how strong Peaty is. In his semi-final he was a little bit lower in the water as he set his world record. Because he's not quite as high as he is in the 100m, he has a quicker turnover. He can keep that up for 50m, but not for a 100m - that's why he went to 25.95 seconds. You couldn't do that in the 100m because of the build-up of lactic acid. But because it's Adam Peaty, he might be able to manage that in a year.

reference,Controversial plans for 10 marine conservation zones have been withdrawn by a Welsh government minister.,"Alun Davies told AMs they had received 7,000 responses to a consultation containing ""strongly held"" views. He said he would now look at the 125 existing marine protected areas to see if further improvements could be made. The Marine Conservation Society (MCS) described it as an ""embarrassing U-turn"" for the Welsh government, and has called for better protection of seas. Creating the zones would mean a ban on fishing and anchoring in some areas and had brought opposition. The Welsh Fishermen's Association said previously that existing conservation networks for Welsh waters are adequate. The Welsh government proposed the zones last year with the backing of the Countryside Council of Wales and the Marine Conservation Society. The minister for natural resources said the decision had been made after the thousands of responses to the consultation brought ""divergent and strongly held views"". Mr Davies said to ""avoid any continuing uncertainty over the options presented in the 2012 consultation, I am also withdrawing all the proposed sites"". His comments come after the findings were published of a task and finish team which reviewed the feedback. Now, he will concentrate on the existing 125 Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) that cover 36% of Welsh seas to see if any changes can be made rather than creating additional zones. ""We are now in a stronger position to assess our current contribution to the network's ecological coherence,"" he said. ""I have, therefore, commissioned an assessment of our current MPAs to identify if there are any gaps and what the options might be to fill those gaps. ""If any measures are required, I believe they should be simple, proportionate and fit for purpose."" Dr Peter Richardson, biodiversity programme manager for MCS, said the Welsh government ""spent an awful lot of time and money and encouraged other people to put effort into this consultation response"".

reference,Convention never stood much chance of standing between Neil Lennon and Hibernian.,"His previous jobs were at Celtic and Bolton, but moving to the second tier of Scottish football was no hindrance to him returning to work at Easter Road. Lennon saw the vacancy as an opportunity, and that was enough to encourage Hibs that a figure of his profile and experience would accept a role in the Championship. Even though his last job in Scotland involved leading a team on Champions League duty, Lennon's mind has not been swayed by haughtiness. The appointment of the former Celtic manager as successor to Alan Stubbs suits both parties, because it is mutually beneficial. Success is alluring, and Hibs offer Lennon the chance to accumulate more achievements. He was immediately engaged in crisis management at his previous club Bolton, but will find stability, potential and accomplishment at Easter Road. The demand will be to deliver promotion, but that will not seem daunting when the majority of the squad that pushed Rangers for a while last season then won the Scottish Cup is still in place. Lennon's task is to refine and bolster the team, when new managers are often faced with a period of overhaul. Stubbs left the club on an emotional high after delivering their first Scottish Cup in 114 years, but before the final against Rangers there was a tangible sense of exasperation that promotion had been missed. Hibs were entitled to feel that it was an unnecessary failure given their circumstances. The club is about to embark on a third season in the Championship, but by most other measures they can be considered a top-flight outfit. The budget will be significantly more than the rest of the teams in the division, the training ground at East Mains and facilities are first-class, the football side of the business is stable and well-run by George Craig, the club's head of football operations, the squad is full of talent. Lennon can rely on consistently assured performances from the likes of David Gray, Darren McGregor, Paul Hanlon, Lewis Stevenson, John McGinn, Fraser Fyvie, Dylan McGeouch, James Keatings and Jason Cummings. Some minor issues remain, such as who will fill the goal next season, but the challenge is more on adding depth and strength of will to the squad and man-management. McGinn, one of the most reliably effective players in the Championship last season, has already insisted that he remains committed to Hibs despite the failure to achieve promotion. The 21-year-old midfielder provides the kind of industry and spirit that a team can be built around. There may be critical decisions to make, though, since Cummings is entering the final year of his contract and so represents a sellable asset. He is a regular goalscorer, though, and Stubbs had to sign Anthony Stokes on loan last January to provide some support up front. These are tweaks compared to the amount of work Stubbs had to carry out when he was appointed two years ago. Hibs are ready to be guided forward, not waiting to be rescued.

Election officials have urged patience. Uhuru Kenyatta, who faces trial at the International Criminal Court, has been leading in early presidential results declared from Monday's tightly contested election. He is due to stand trial at The Hague next month for allegedly fuelling violence after the disputed 2007 election. He denies the charge. His closest rival is outgoing Prime Minister Raila Odinga. With provisional results in from more than 40% of polling stations earlier on Wednesday, Mr Odinga had 42% of the vote compared with Mr Kenyatta's 53%. However, Mr Odinga's allies remain confident that he will gain ground as results from his strongholds, including the Coast Province, are declared. More than 1,000 people were killed in the violence which broke out in 2007-08 after Mr Odinga claimed he had been cheated of victory by supporters of President Mwai Kibaki, who is stepping down after two terms in office. The BBC's Solomon Mugera in the capital, Nairobi, says Kenyans are becoming increasingly anxious about the delay in finalising the results. Some businesses and schools across the country have remained shut since Monday's election, he says. This has led to a shortage of goods, pushing up the prices of basic foodstuff in areas such as Kibera, the biggest slum in Nairobi and a stronghold of Mr Odinga, our correspondent adds. Uhuru Kenyatta Raila Odinga Profile: Uhuru Kenyatta Profile: Raila Odinga Some electoral officials have had to drive hundreds of kilometres to the counting centre in Nairobi to deliver paper copies of the tally of their returns. At about 13:00 local time, returning officers from only 53 of the 290 constituencies had arrived and the election commission said it would announce results from constituencies as they were ready. Its website had stopped giving updated results from the presidential race on Wednesday, and was still showing figures from Tuesday night. Our correspondent says the large number of spoiled ballots - about 6% of the total vote, well over double the number of votes cast for the third-placed candidate, Musailia Mudavadi - has become a major bone of contention. Mr Odinga's Coalition of Reforms and Democracy (Cord) wants them to be counted, but Mr Kenyatta's Jubilee Coalition is resisting this. Late on Tuesday, the election commission announced that the spoiled ballots would count in the overall vote total, increasing the likelihood of a run-off between the top two candidates, news agencies report. Mr Kenyatta's running mate William Ruto, who is also facing a trial at the ICC, said foreign embassies may have influenced such a decision. ""We want to believe that this is not an attempt to deny the Jubilee Coalition a first-round victory as is clearly now on the wall,"" he is quoted by Reuters news agency as saying.

The article also said he had warned the PM the UK would have to pay its ""fair share"" and spend 2% of GDP on defence. In response, Number 10 said there were ""many difficult challenges"" in Libya, while the White House said it deeply valued the UK's contributions. Downing Street did not comment on President Obama's remark to the PM about defence spending, reportedly made before Chancellor George Osborne said the government would fulfil a Nato pledge to spend 2% of national income on defence last year. In response to the interview, a spokesman for the US National Security Council said Mr Cameron had been ""as close a partner as the president has had"" adding that ""we deeply value the UK's contributions on our shared national security and foreign policy objectives"". BBC North America editor Jon Sopel said the unsolicited statement put out by the White House suggested Downing Street had reacted angrily to the article. ""It's like we've seen a curtain drawn back on the unspun thoughts of President Obama, complete with frustration as well, and what we've seen tonight is the White House trying to close the curtain as quickly as it can,"" he added. The toppling of the Gaddafi regime in Libya - following UN-backed air strikes designed to protect civilians - led to a power vacuum and instability, with no authority in full control. The intervention was led by the UK and France - and in his interview, Mr Obama reflects on ""what went wrong"", saying: ""There's room for criticism, because I had more faith in the Europeans, given Libya's proximity, being invested in the follow-up."" Mr Cameron, he said, became ""distracted by a range of other things"". He also criticised former French President Nicolas Sarkozy, saying he had tried to claim the spotlight. The former French president, he said, ""wanted to trumpet the flights he was taking in the air campaign, despite the fact that we had wiped out all the air defences and essentially set up the entire infrastructure"" for the intervention. President Obama said the intervention ""averted large-scale civilian casualties (and) prevented what almost surely would have been a prolonged and bloody civil conflict"". But he added: ""And despite all that, Libya is a mess."" He also criticised what he called ""free riders"" in the interview, saying European and Gulf countries were calling for action against Gaddafi, adding: ""But what has been a habit over the last several decades in these circumstances is people pushing us to act but then showing an unwillingness to put any skin in the game."" Despite efforts to support Libya's National Transitional Council, and the first elections in the country for decades, it rapidly descended into violence, with two rival governments and the formation of hundreds of militias, some allied to so-called Islamic State.

I was here on 25 January when riot police forced us out and by the 28th, we were back following the violence. I've been sleeping here most of the time since. Our social network was established in 2005, when there was a democratic opening around the time of the presidential elections. People from different backgrounds all met through blogging and hoped to use technology for social change. It meant we have all gained good contacts, experience and strong networks. I like to think the social network is the people itself. Things like Facebook, Twitter, SMS and phones are just social tools. When they blocked Facebook and shut down technology, our network still operated because it's about people. Internet activists are also people and a lot of our organising, social work and relationships are developed offline. This is something that people dreamt of but didn't anticipate happening in reality. If anything, it shows that all the effort we put in over the past few years has not been wasted. It has climaxed into this critical mass of people you see in the square. At the moment I'm not getting a lot of internet connection. I'm trying not to drain my phone battery. We're still using it to distribute footage people are bringing to us that we've sorted through. I hope the internet will continue to play a complementary role in activism.

reference,England had to settle for a draw after an extraordinary final session on the fifth day of the first Test against Pakistan in Abu Dhabi.,"Pakistan seemed to be cruising to a draw before debutant Adil Rashid - who returned 0-163 in the first innings - turned the match with five wickets. Needing 99 to win, England sent out Jos Buttler and Ben Stokes in the top four. But they were eventually beaten by the fading light, finishing 25 runs short of a famous victory on 74-4. The tourists could not find the boundary frequently enough before the umpires brought the teams off, with Joe Root 33 not out. However, this was a hugely impressive performance from England and one that will fill them with confidence ahead of the second Test in Dubai, which begins on Thursday. After England concluded their innings on 598-9 in the morning, Pakistan looked assured at 113-3 shortly after tea, leading by 38 with seven second-innings wickets remaining. But the match turned when veteran batsman Younus Khan, playing in his 102nd Test match, mistimed a wild heave to give Rashid his first Test wicket - caught at point by Stokes. Rashid - whose figures in the first innings were the worst ever by a debutant - then quickly added a second victim, having Asad Shafiq caught behind for six. The door was opened for England, and Rashid and Moeen Ali barged through it as they polished off the last five wickets for 14 runs. Pakistan skipper Misbah ul-Haq - who had played with restraint for his 51 - inexplicably aimed an uncharacteristic slog at Moeen and was bowled. Moeen then removed Wahab Riaz caught behind, before Rashid claimed the final three wickets - all superbly caught at first slip by James Anderson. England sensed an unlikely victory, but their reorganised batting order could not score quickly enough as Pakistan's tactic of spin from both ends and fielders on the boundary brought them regular wickets. Makeshift opener Buttler was trapped lbw for four, Moeen and Stokes were caught on the boundary in quick succession, and Jonny Bairstow was stumped attempting a big shot. However, in truth it was mistakes earlier in the match that ultimately proved more costly as England fell just short of their first win on the subcontinent since beating India in Kolkata in 2012. In Pakistan's first innings, Ian Bell dropped Mohammad Hafeez (98) and Shafiq (107) at slip early in their innings. And Shoaib Malik, who made 245, was dismissed off a no-ball by Stuart Broad.

reference,"Foreign observers of the UK's debate on its forthcoming referendum on whether to stay in the European Union may have noticed an awful lot of fuss about the views of a man called Boris Johnson - yes, that man on the zip wire.","Mr Johnson, the Mayor of London, announced on Sunday that he would be backing the campaign for Britain to leave the EU. His intervention in the debate - made, as he termed it, with ""deafening eclat"" - was even said to have helped cause the pound to slide on the international money markets as traders thought it made the possibility of a so-called Brexit more likely. He has arguably the highest profile of any of the governing Conservative Party except the Prime Minister David Cameron, but those outside the UK may be wondering: who is he, and is that actually his hair? Read on. Profile: Boris Johnson How could 'zip wire prat' become prime minister? Read more about the UK's referendum on the EU Alexander Boris de Pfeffel Johnson, to give him his full name, was born in New York and is descended from Turkish, French and German stock. He describes himself as a ""one-man melting pot"". He first made a name for himself in journalism, including a stint as Brussels correspondent for the right-wing Daily Telegraph newspaper and editor of The Spectator magazine. His humorous persona led him to become a fixture on various television programmes, including the satirical BBC panel show Have I Got News For You. He still has a lucrative and entertaining column in the Daily Telegraph, in which august forum he explained the reasons for his decision on the EU. As a politician, he has been a Conservative member of parliament for two constituencies, Henley from 2001 to 2008 and then Uxbridge and South Ruislip from 2015. Lest you think he was putting his feet up between parliamentary mandates, he is also currently serving the second of two terms as mayor of London, no mean feat in a city where the centre-left Labour Party has dominated in recent decades. That's indicative of the position Mr Johnson has carved out for himself as one of the most charismatic politicians in the UK who has wide appeal beyond Conservative heartlands - polling has suggested that his stance on the EU referendum may sway some undecided voters. Just look what happens when you type his name into Google.co.uk. Not quite. He has previously courted controversy for his remarks about (among others) the populations of Liverpool, Portsmouth and Papua New Guinea, not to mention run-ins with his own party leadership and TV chef Jamie Oliver. Last October he accidentally flattened a 10-year-old schoolboy at what was meant to be a friendly game of photo-op rugby in Japan. But none of this seems to have affected his standing among the party faithful or the public at large. Even getting stuck on a zip-wire during the London Olympics in 2012, a sure-fire route to derision for any other politician, only enhanced his eccentric image. Mr Johnson finally ended months of speculation about which side of the EU debate he would back in an immaculately impromptu media scrum outside his home in North London, having reportedly informed the prime minister of his decision earlier the same day.

This choice was Stefanini and that remains the French proposal,"" said spokesman Stephane Le Foll.

reference,Historical Chinese documents have helped scientists to track the decline of the world's rarest primates.,"Today, China has between 26 and 28 Hainan gibbons left, but government records that date back to the 17th Century show that gibbons were once widespread across half of the country. The apes began to disappear from the documents about 150 years ago, corresponding with population growth. The study is published in the Proceedings of the Royal Society B. Hainan gibbons are now limited to a few isolated patches of forest in the south west of China. They live in just four social groups, one of which was only discovered a few weeks ago. Understanding this population crash has been difficult, but the old government documents have helped to reveal when and how the numbers fell. Dr Sam Turvey, from the Zoological Society of London, said: ""China is one of the few places in the world that has a very very rich, long historical record. ""Because it has had such a complex bureaucracy for so long, there has been a lot of need for reporting - not just numbers of households for tax purposes and things like that, but also in terms of the kinds of natural resources that were available in the immediate environment."" These included records of animals, including gibbons, he said. ""We looked at the pattern of disappearance of gibbons through time and how that varied from place to place and the different environmental conditions and human pressures that were also present in these places."" The archives show that gibbons were a common sight in about 20 provinces in China well into the 17th and 18th Century. However, Dr Turvey said it was ""a stark contrast to their very imperilled position today"". ""We see a really steep increase in population decline and real population collapse across China about 100-150 years ago,"" he added. ""And this correlates with demographic expansion in China towards the end of the Imperial era and through the 20th Century, and the massive increase in deforestation and human population growth through the time of the Chinese Republic and the establishment of the communist party."" The researchers said a better understanding of the animals' decline would help them to establish a conservation plan for the country's last few Hainan gibbons. Dr Turvey said: ""It is an incredible privilege to be able to see gibbons in China in the wild. ""The Hainan gibbon is such as rare species, but knowing that this species is still hanging on there gives you hope that conservation will be able to bring that population back from the brink.""

reference,"In a sport beset by tiresome braggadocio, Ricky Burns seems like an impostor.","With three defeats in his previous six bouts, the Scottish boxer's career seemed to be on the wane. But his power, timing and focus returned in a supremely confident display at Glasgow's Hydro on Saturday night as he clinched the vacant WBA World Super-Lightweight title - and entered the record books as the first Scot to win world titles at three weights. Italy's Michele Di Rocco, at 34 a year older than Burns, hadn't lost a fight since September 2007. He arrived with a record of 40 wins and a draw from 42 bouts. He left a lesser figure. The referee deemed the man from Assisi to be in no state to continue in the eighth round, the result of a welter of blows to his head and body and made all the more unbearable by the hostile acoustic energy generated by 8,000 Scottish fans. Surely, for Burns, this was time to shout about his record, the ideal moment to counter all those who had written him off and questioned the wisdom of him leaving trainer Billy Nelson two years ago to work with Tony Sim in Essex? No. Instead, the champion spoke of his disbelief at the ease of his victory, his gratitude that he was safe, of his thanks to promoter Eddie Hearn, manager Alex Morrison and coach Sim for believing in him, and of his desire to celebrate with a fast-food burger and 20 chicken nuggets. ""When I got in the ring after the fight, I said, 'You've done it! You've done it!',"" reported a beaming Hearn at the post-fight media conference. ""And you know what Ricky said? 'Can you get a picture with me and Michael Buffer [the legendary American boxing ring announcer]?'"" When he has time to reflect during a well-earned holiday, Burns will take immense satisfaction at being only the third British-born fighter, after Bob Fitzsimmons and Duke McKenzie, to be a three-weight world champion. In Scottish terms, his achievements must mean that he is in the very top tier of boxing greats, comfortably mentioned in the same breath as former world champions Benny Lynch, Walter McGowan, Jackie Paterson, Ken Buchanan and Jim Watt, for example. Burns' record stands at 40 wins from 46 bouts. Remarkably, 11 of those have been world title fights. Buchanan's exploits in the United States add lustre to his legacy, but while Burns may never have fought someone like Roberto Duran, should Hearn manage to set up a bout against Cincinnati's Adrien Broner, the four-time world champion stripped of the WBA title because he could not make the weight, then Burns could achieve little more in the sport. ""There are some big fights out there for me,"" said Burns. ""I want to fight the top names. I will fight anybody. I do super-lightweight comfortably and lightweight is still an option. I would fight Terence Crawford again if it came down to it. ""That's nearly two years I have been with Tony and things have just started clicking.

reference,"It's one of the best loved books in American literature, but To Kill a Mockingbird was also a one-hit wonder.","Harper Lee's classic was published 50 years ago this summer and it remains the only novel she ever wrote. Lee, 84, has never explained why she stopped writing. She doesn't give interviews - ""Hell, no"" was her response to a request several decades ago - and that silence has only added to the intrigue. But her close friend Thomas Lane Butts, a retired minister in her hometown, Monroeville, Alabama, says she once told him the reason. Sitting on a pew in the Methodist church which the Lee family still attends, he described to me how she suddenly brought the subject up one night over dinner in New York. ""She asked me, 'You ever wonder why I didn't write anything else?' And I said, 'Along with several million other people, yes, I had wondered about that.' And she said, 'Well, what do you think?'"" Speaking in his slow southern drawl, the Rev Butts, who just turned 80, suggested to her that she had already written a great book and therefore didn't need to compete with herself. ""And when I got through she said, 'You're all wrong.' I said, 'Alright, smart Alec. You tell me.' She said, 'I would not go through all the deprivation of privacy through which I went for this book again for any amount of money.' ""And she said, 'I did not need to write another book. I said what I wanted to say in that book.'"" Harper Lee called it a simple tale about the ""conflict of the human soul"" and Monroeville, Alabama, is where she drew her inspiration. The story depicts the segregated South of her childhood, during the Depression. It was published at the height of the civil rights struggle. The Rev Butts grew up 10 miles outside Monroeville. By the late 1950s, he says, he was a ""fuzzy-cheeked young preacher"" campaigning for an end to segregation. He had met Martin Luther King Jr and signed a petition to boycott buses. The Ku Klux Klan had left a burning cross on his front lawn. He says To Kill a Mockingbird was not well received in Monroeville when it was published. ""The people who were hard racist did not like it because of the implication of the book,"" the Rev Butts told me. ""The book revealed racism and that always frightens a racist - when you pull the cover off them. ""Those of us who stood up for civil rights were much encouraged by the book because in a very skilful and subtle way it addressed itself for justice."" But these days, the Rev Butts says, there is enormous civic pride in Monroeville. The old courthouse, which Hollywood re-created for the film, now houses a museum to Harper Lee and the town's other literary icon, Truman Capote. Capote was a childhood friend of hers and is thought to be the inspiration for the Dill character in To Kill a Mockingbird. The town's residents often try to protect Lee, allowing her to live a normal life instead of being hounded by fans or bothered with prying questions. ""Being famous",1,4,3

""We were [rehearsing] in the tent for about a week and a half, then we had to move to bigger studios in Hollywood where we are working on the rest of the show,"" she told Houston radio station Mix 96.5. ""And then we will send that equipment to Houston where we will finish rehearsals. Fans can expect a performance that spans my career so far."" She has a high standard to live up to - notably Prince's show in 2007, which took place in the middle of a Miami thunderstorm and is widely accepted as the greatest performance in the event's history, if not Prince's career. Here are some of the other most memorable - and surprising - moments from the last 30 years. Super Bowl performers get a very strict 12-minute time limit, so most performers cram their set with as much music as possible. Not Michael Jackson. After shooting onto the stage at the Pasadena Rose Bowl, he stood completely still, staring at the world for a full 90 seconds. Ninety. It was a master class in ratcheting expectation to a fever pitch. And the screams when he launched into Jam (not one of his best songs) proved he knew what he was doing. Brilliantly, Jackson staged this entire performance while wearing a jacket it looked like he'd borrowed from Muammar Gaddafi. Beat that, Gaga. Baby, he was born to run... and slide on his knees... and crotch slam a TV camera. In his autobiography, The Boss explains the incident like this: ""Too much adrenalin, a late drop, too much speed, here I come, Mikeâ€¦ BOOM! ""And I'm onto his camera, the lens implanted into my chest with one leg off the stage. I use his camera to push myself back up andâ€¦ BLAM! BORN TO RUN!""

""Do we have any mead makers or home brewers in the group?"" asks Ben Alexander, eying a crowd of a dozen or so people who have come to his Maine Meade Works, in Portland, on a rainy Friday for a tour. When no-one raises their hand, Mr Alexander launches into the full spiel. ""If you guys want to come around, I'll show you how this thing works,"" he says, gesturing to two ceiling-high columns of stainless steel filled with something resembling a mushy golden porridge. ""We mix up honey and water over there and we pump it through a hot water bath at 160 degrees [71C] in a stainless steel coil here. Each one produces about 50 to 75 gallons [227-340 litres] of mead a day,"" explains Mr Alexander. It's fair to say he is obsessed with mead. ""It's the quintessential local beverage - you can go anywhere in the world and find honey to make mead, and I think that's unique among alcoholic beverages,"" he gushes. After being introduced to the drink by a home brewer, Mr Alexander thought there were profits to be had in a commercial meadery. He founded Maine Mead Works in 2008, pouring his savings and money from friends and family into the business. His business has since grown, along with the popularity of mead in the US. It's now a seven-person operation that manufactures more than 7,500 cases a year, shipping them as far away as China. Mr Alexander is not the only one to have caught on to the commercial potential of mead. Vicky Rowe, the owner of mead information website GotMead, says interest in the product in the US has exploded in the past decade. ""We went from 30-40 meaderies making mead to somewhere in the vicinity of 250 in the last 10 years,"" she says. ""I like to say that everything old is new again - people come back to what was good once."" Even visitors to Mr Alexander's meadery agree. Tour participant Dirk Heseman admitted that while Maine Mead Works was the first meadery he'd actually visited, he has noticed that mead ""is becoming more and more available - similar to cider"". Just this year, commercial meaderies in the US have banded together to form an industry group, the American Mead Makers Association, to better share information and encourage growth in the industry. But there's a lot of work that needs to be done to improve the image of a drink long associated with Renaissance fairs and medieval re-enactments. ""I think our number one challenge as an industry is awareness of what mead is,"" says Mr Alexander. ""You ask 10 people in a room if they've ever heard of mead, and two of them might say, 'yes', and only one of them has had a very positive experience."" The mead of the past was often sweet, and didn't appeal to many drinkers",0,5,3

Or were they heading to so-called Islamic State territory?"" he said. The group was taken to a police station in southern Turkey overnight, and then sent to the foreigners department awaiting deportation to the UK. They have undergone medical examinations and had their finger-prints taken. The United Nations estimates the number of foreign fighters joining militant groups is more than 25,000, from 100 different nations.

Fadi Hakura, Turkey analyst for Chatham House, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the recent arrests showed the Turkish government was ""taking more effective measures to control the flow of fighters and supporters into Syria"". He said there was now ""more enhanced security and intelligence cooperation between Turkey and its Western counterparts, especially with the exchange of names that Turkey needs to prohibit [IS supporters] from crossing into Syria"". The Turkish government has said it cannot make a 560-mile border watertight and will act when it has prior warning. In February this year there were recriminations between British police and Turkish officials after three London schoolgirls disappeared from Turkey, apparently having crossed the border into Syria. Shamima Begum, Amira Abase, both 15, and Kadiza Sultana, 16 had flown to Istanbul and travelled to the border region.

Appointments affected include scans and consultations with specialists - including those for cancer patients. The British Medical Association said such incentives were ""misguided"". At least nine clinical commissioning groups (CCGs) were offering GP practices payments for hitting targets, according to Pulse's investigation. In one case, Birmingham South Central CCG was offering practices more than Â£11,000 to reduce new outpatient attendances, follow-ups, A&E attendances and emergency admissions by 1%, compared with 2014/15. It said the schemes, which exclude cancer referrals, were designed to ""incentivise best quality practice"" and ""drive improvements in the quality of primary medical care"". ""Our priority is to ensure that patients have access to services that they need, when they need them,"" said a spokesperson for Birmingham South Central CCG. Another CCG told Pulse it had considered the ""full impact"" of the incentive scheme and was ""confident that there is no conflict of interest"". Pulse said that one scheme had already been looked at by the General Medical Council, the body which regulates medical standards in the UK, after local GP leaders expressed their concern. The magazine pointed out that initial hospital referrals for cancer patients should happen within two weeks of a GP first suspecting the condition. Dr Chand Nagpaul, chairman of the GPs committee of the doctors' trade union the British Medical Association, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that such schemes were a ""financial contaminant"" to patient-doctor trust. He said: ""It's short-sighted and misguided of CCGs to introduce such mechanisms, because they do lead to the potential for patients questioning the motives of GP referrals. ""We believe it is far more appropriate for CCGs to introduce clinical pathways that ensure patients are referred appropriately rather than these crude, salesman-like bonuses which pay GPs simply to make reduction to referrals in numerical terms."" Dr Peter Melton is local GP and clinical chief officer for North East Lincolnshire CCG, which offers the equivalent of more than Â£6,000 to practices that reduce outpatient referrals to the same level as the 25% with the lowest referral rates (which include two-week urgent cancer referrals) in 2014/15. He said the CCG was already among the best in England for referring suspected cancer patients to a consultant within two weeks and the scheme was not about avoiding sending people to hospital. ""It is not focussing on referral reduction per se but on better clinical and quality standards for the patient,"" he explained.

Governing bodies are bracing themselves for potential job losses. About 60% of funding is made up from Scottish Government money, with lottery sales making up the rest. In the year ending 2015, total revenue was £65.1m, which is divided up and awarded to 52 sports.

The group has warned that 750 more foster carers are ""urgently"" needed to meet the demands of the care system. It urged people to ""open their hearts and homes"" to vulnerable youngsters. Currently, more than 5,500 children are in foster care in Scotland, living with 4,400 families and carers. The Fostering Network surveyed 250 children, teenagers and foster carers across Scotland and discovered that many young people had failed to find stability. Almost half were already living with their third family, a quarter were with their fourth family and about 20 were living with their 10th family since going into care. There was a particular need for homes to be found for vulnerable teenagers, siblings and disabled children, the study found. Carla, 23, was taken into care at the age of 12 and had eight foster homes before moving in with the Randalls. ""Looking back now I realised that the Randalls saved my life,"" she said. ""I never understood the extent of the neglect and abuse I had endured until I came to live with a 'normal' loving family. ""They were just always themselves, the smallest details meant so much to me. ""They nurtured a young, angry, untrusting teenager to become a positive, empathetic and successful young woman."" The Fostering Network said instability had a detrimental effect on the child's education and wellbeing, while finding a stable foster carer from the outset could lead to improved relationships and a happier childhood. Sara Lurie, director of the Fostering Network Scotland, said: ""As each year passes, we see more and more children coming into care. ""We need people who can open their heart, and their homes, to vulnerable children and young people and use their skills to help support them to reach their full potential. ""In particular we need people who have the skills, patience and passion to look after teenagers who may have had a really tough time and be facing some real challenges, and to offer them love, stability and security.

Apologies for the delay, see below as requested. A Scottish government spokeswoman said: ""Giving young people security is paramount and we have done a great deal of work with our partners across local government and the third sector to improve how we intervene early when there is a problem within families to find appropriate solutions quickly.

reference,Ten-man Inverness Caledonian Thistle fell four points adrift at the foot of the Scottish Premiership with defeat by St Johnstone.,"Steven Maclean bundled home the opener five minutes before half-time. The hosts, slacker after the break, had beleaguered striker Larnell Cole sent-off after he confronted the referee. Liam Craig sealed the win from the penalty spot with two minutes to play, before Graham Cummins finished a sumptuous stoppage-time move. And things got worse still for Caley Thistle after the match, with captain Gary Warren shown a red card in the tunnel. Saints remain five points clear of Hearts in fourth place, and closed the gap on third-placed Rangers, who play Aberdeen on Sunday, to three points. With game after game ticking past, Inverness' position looks increasingly perilous. Next weekend's trip to Motherwell, second-bottom on goal difference, is now seismic. This contest turned nightmarish for the hosts after a bright opening, but the truth is, given their predicament, Caley Thistle did not threaten St Johnstone's goal enough. Billy Mckay sent a shot over from close range. Alex Fisher nodded a diving header wide. Carl Tremarco miscued a volley. Greg Tansey did draw a save from Alan Mannus when he rasped in an effort from outside the box, but Richie Foran's side never looked likely to find the net. Their best opportunity came immediately after the Saints went ahead, when Tansey fed Cole, who seemed to panic in a terrific position and shot straight at Mannus. Cole's dismissal ended the contest when he appeared to be cautioned twice for challenging referee Stephen Finnie's decision not to award a foul. St Johnstone were merciless and could have had more. With just one win from their last 21 league games, Inverness look deep in trouble. Tommy Wright's side deserve so much credit. Saints were tactically brilliant, so strong defensively and ruthlessly capitalised on their man advantage. They took one of their few first-half chances when Michael Coulson broke down the left and sent a dangerous ball across the six-yard box. Owain Fon Williams could only parry into the danger area, Cummins' shot was blocked but Maclean followed up to force it home. They should have had another when Craig's superb curling corner flew all the way to the back post where Cummins slid in and somehow knocked it over from two yards. Craig, in his 300th appearance for the club, coolly converted a spot-kick after Cummins was tripped to seal the points. Cummins then slammed home after Miller danced around the area to tee him up, before Craig cracked the bar amid the late flurry. With a tendency to finish the season strongly, and just a three-point gap to Rangers, the Perth side look capable of something special this term. Inverness CT manager Richie Foran: ""It is a tough time of the season to be sitting bottom, and I need real men to stand up to that, but not enough of them did that today.

The BBC's Yogita Limaye in Mumbai said that just a year ago India was aspiring for double-digit growth. But a global slowdown has reduced external demand, and high inflation coupled with a weak rupee has made things more expensive within the country. Domestic demand, which India's economy is largely reliant on, has also slowed in part due to the political upheaval in the country. India's economy is suffering from ""policy incoherence, shifting global risk appetite and a comatose government"", said Rajeev Malik, senior economist at brokerage CLSA India's Prime Minister Manmohan Singh admitted early this month that his government must do more to get the once fast-growing economy moving again. The Congress-led coalition government is caught up in a slew of corruption scandals. Key policy reforms, including allowing foreign investment in India's retail sector, have been delayed in parliament for more than a year. This has worried foreign investors and threatened the country's investment grade credit rating. ""This is definitely a very important signal for the government - this is a make or break situation for India and the government has to step on the panic button,"" said Rupa Rege Nitsure, chief economist at Bank of Baroda in Mumbai. ""If the government doesn't step in now, India's sovereign ratings may be jeopardised.""",0,5,3
reference,The PSNI has launched a murder inquiry into the death of a prison officer who died 11 days after being injured in a dissident republican bomb attack.,"Adrian Ismay, 52, was seriously hurt after a booby-trap device exploded under his van in Belfast on 4 March. The police said that a post-mortem examination showed he died as a ""direct result of the injuries"" of the bomb. A dissident republican group, widely referred to as the new IRA, said it carried out the attack. The organisation said Mr Ismay was targeted for training officers at Maghaberry Prison near Lisburn, County Antrim. Sue McAllister, director general of the Northern Ireland Prison Service, spent time with the Ismay family on Wednesday. She said they were ""devastated and beyond shock at what's happened"". ""Like all of us, they thought that he was on the mend and was doing really well,"" said Mrs McAllister. ""We thought he would make a full recovery, we expected him to come back to work in due course, so we're all shocked, but particularly Sharon and her daughters."" Mrs McAllister condemned the behaviour of some paramilitary inmates at Maghaberry Prison, who reportedly cheered, smoked cigars and mocked wardens at the high-security jail when news of Mr Ismay's death filtered through. ""This was just unacceptable behaviour by a very small number of prisoners,"" said Mrs McAllister. ""My colleagues in Maghaberry dealt with it professionally, with great fortitude and with the courage they display on a daily basis."" She admitted she and her colleagues in the Prison Service felt ""very angry"" on hearing the reports of the celebrations in the exercise yard of the prison. ""We encounter challenging behaviour by a small number of prisoners every day, and we deal with it with great professionalism and we do not stoop to behaving that way in response,"" she added. A man appeared in court on Saturday charged in connection with the bomb attack on Mr Ismay. Det Ch Insp Richard Campbell said it was ""yet another difficult day for the Ismay family, his friends and colleagues as they struggle to come to terms with the events of the past 12 days"". He added: ""We have spoken to the family this morning and advised them of this development. ""We are also liaising with the Public Prosecution Service in relation to the individual who is currently charged with attempted murder and causing an explosion with intent to endanger life.""

reference,"The US Supreme Court has upheld a key portion of President Barack Obama's healthcare law, preserving health insurance for millions of Americans.","In a 6-3 decision, the justices said that tax subsidies that make health insurance affordable for low-income individuals can continue. The ruling preserves the law known as Obamacare, which Mr Obama considers a major part of his presidential legacy. Republicans have vowed to continue fighting the law. ""We've got more work to do, but what we're not going to do is unravel what has now been woven into the fabric of America,"" Mr Obama said. The case, known as King v Burwell, was the second major challenge the law has faced in the US's highest court. Unlike in many other western countries, the US does not have a single-payer healthcare system. Private companies, rather than the US government, provide health insurance for US citizens. The enactment of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) - one of Mr Obama's most significant and controversial domestic achievements - in 2010 mandated that every American had to purchase private insurance. It provided the subsidies to allow many to do so. In 2012, the mandate portion of the law was challenged in the court. The justices ruled to preserve it. In that decision, as in the decision on Thursday, Chief Justice John Roberts surprised observers by siding with his liberal colleagues in support of the law. ""Congress passed the Affordable Care act to improve health insurance markets, not to destroy them,"" Chief Justice John Roberts wrote in the opinion. Justice Anthony Kennedy dissented in 2012, but sided with the majority on Thursday. Had the court made the opposite decision, an estimated 8.7 million people in the US would have been at risk of losing the aid that makes healthcare affordable. The stakes could not have been higher. People's health (crucially important) and Obama's legacy (less important, but for him and those around him fairly vital) were at stake. Well a politically finely balanced Supreme Court has given an emphatic, overwhelming vote in favour of the president by 6-3. I bet ""No-drama Obama"" is high-fiving anyone and everyone in the White House - that is how big it is. Obama defies lame-duck expectations Demonstrators gathered outside the court as early on Thursday morning. Reading updates on their mobile phones, the crowd became jubilant when they learned mid-morning that the court had ruled in their favour. Some began dancing, while others chanted ""If you're covered and you know it clap your hands."" ""This is a big sigh of relief for millions across the country,"" said Ron Pollack of Families USA, a health-care advocacy organisation. ""The ACA is not just the law of the land, it will remain the law of the land"". ""Today is a good day for healthcare in America,"" said activist Benton Strong. ""I hope this is the end of the line."" Demonstrators opposing the subsidies did not have a large visible presence. Justice Antonin Scalia wrote in his dissent that the Supreme Court is setting a precedent of favouring some laws over others. ""We should start calling this law Scotuscare"" Justice Scalia wrote, referring to the court's acronym. ""Today's interpretation is not merely unnatural; it is unheard",1,5,4

The system would appoint a named person - usually a teacher or health visitor - to ensure the wellbeing of every child. But judges at the UK's highest court ruled against the scheme in July 2016, citing concerns over information sharing. The Supreme Court judges said some proposals breached rights to privacy and a family life under the European Convention on Human Rights. However, the court said the aim of the Act, which is intended to promote and safeguard the rights and wellbeing of children and young people, was legitimate. Speaking ahead of his statement to the Scottish Parliament, Mr Swinney said the Scottish government remained ""absolutely committed"" to the Named Person service as a way to support children and their families. ""Last year the Supreme Court ruled definitively that the intention of providing a Named Person for every child to promote and safeguard their wellbeing was 'unquestionably legitimate and benign',"" he said.

reference,"The fate of ailing department store BHS is likely to be decided later on Thursday, with an announcement expected from administrators Duff & Phelps.","BHS entered administration in April. Since then, efforts have been continuing to rescue it from closure and save the jobs of its 11,000 staff. Last week, a surprise late bid led by retail veteran Greg Tufnell transformed the race to acquire the retailer. His team, said to be backed by Portuguese money, is the front-runner. But if a deal cannot be struck, the business may still have to be liquidated. The remaining bidders have faded into the background. Another consortium led by Matalan tycoon John Hargreaves and Turkish retail entrepreneur Cafer Mahiroglu has reportedly run into difficulties, while other suitors have apparently failed to impress with their proposals. Some of those involved in the different bids have impressive retailing histories. But then Sir Philip Green, who controlled BHS from 2000 to 2015, also had a brilliant track record. And he ended up selling the business for Â£1. So what are the chances of saving BHS from the liquidators? And just who are the people aiming to do it? In the public eye, Greg Tufnell is easily overshadowed by his more famous brother Phil, the former England cricketer. But that could change if his bid for BHS is successful, because he hopes to become the firm's next chairman. And as far as his credentials for the job are concerned, the 54-year-old executive certainly talks the talk. He describes himself as ""a highly experienced managing director with Mothercare and Arcadia, a blend of entrepreneur, strategist and hands-on operator with significant commercial business turnaround, acquisition and fund-raising experience"". His record shows that he was buying and merchandising director at Next from 1991 to 1994. He then spent three years as managing director of menswear retailer Burton, part of the Arcadia group, followed by another three years as managing director of Mothercare. He currently appears to occupy a portfolio of different jobs, including the chairmanships of leather accessories brand Zatchels and recruitment consultancy hga Group. Earlier this month, he registered a new firm, Richess Group, at Companies House. Its other directors are Nick de Scossa, a Swiss banker, and Lisbon-based entrepreneur Jose Maria Soares Bento. Until Mr Tufnell's bid turned up, many observers had assumed that BHS would be snapped up by Matalan founder Mr Hargreaves. But it appears that the cost of a deal may have proved too high. Sources say Mr Hargreaves was asked to improve his offer and balked. Like Sir Philip Green, 71-year-old John Hargreaves also enjoys the life of the super-rich. He has an estimated fortune of Â£1bn, according to the Sunday Times Rich List. But in stark contrast to the ebullient Sir Philip, Mr Hargreaves is described by industry insiders as quiet-spoken, someone who shuns the limelight. Mr Hargreaves is no longer directly involved in the business he founded. He sold his 69% stake in Matalan in 2000, then in 2006 took it private through Missouri Bidco, a company 53.5% owned by him and his family.

The murder, filmed on CCTV and on mobile phones, sparked outrage. The Church of the Almighty God cult is banned in China but claims to have millions of members. Following the brutal killing in May, Chinese authorities said that they detained hundreds of members of the cult, reports the BBC's Martin Patience in Beijing. Interviewed in prison later, one of the defendants, Zhang Lidong showed no remorse. He said: ""I beat her with all my might and stamped on her too. She was a demon. We had to destroy her."" The group had entered a small McDonalds branch in Zhaoyuan in Shandong province last May soliciting phone numbers and hoping to recruit members to their cult. Ms Wu was waiting in the restaurant with her seven-year-old son and when she refused to give her number, an act which prompted the beating while they screamed at other diners to keep away or they would face the same fate. The public face of the Church of the Almighty God is a website full of uplifting hymns and homilies. But its core belief is that God has returned to earth as a Chinese woman to wreak the apocalypse.

A reading below 50 indicates falling output. It is the first time that activity in the sector has fallen since March 2013. Firms blamed soft domestic demand, a fall in new business from overseas and uncertainty ahead of the EU referendum. A slowdown in the oil and gas industry, a major customer for UK companies, is also hitting production. The index for new orders fell to 50.4 in April, from 51.9 the month before, matching February's three-year low. Rob Dobson, senior economist at Markit, said: ""On this evidence manufacturing production is now falling at a quarterly pace of around 1%, and will likely act as a drag on the economy again during the second quarter and putting greater pressure on the service sector to sustain GDP growth. ""The manufacturing labour market is also being impacted, with the data signalling close to 20,000 job losses over the past three months.""

David Noble, group chief executive at the Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply (CIPS), said: ""Recent fears over a stall in the UK's manufacturing sector have now become a reality. ""An atmosphere of deep unease is building throughout the manufacturing supply chain, eating away at new orders, reducing British exports and putting more jobs at risk.

Thousands of Sahrawi refugees still live in refugee camps in Algeria - some have been there for 40 years. It is not clear what happens next but Western Sahara is hopeful that a committee set up by the AU will address the issues that both sides have raised. Some AU delegates said that it would be easier to resolve the issue with Morocco inside the AU. Sidi Mohammed, a Western Sahara official, told the BBC that Morocco's return to the AU means that it would now be expected to put ""in practice decisions taken by the AU with regard to a referendum in Western Sahara"". Mr Mohammed dismissed the suggestion that Morocco would now seek to get the AU to change its position, saying that the no country could unilaterally change the AU fundamental agreement, saying it opposed colonisation. In his speech at the AU summit, King Mohammed VI of Morocco said the readmission was not meant to divide the continental body. No. Algeria has always been a big supporter of Western Sahara's Polisario Front and it had wanted Morocco to accept independence of the territory as a condition for readmission. Zimbabwe and South Africa were also supportive of this stance but they were outnumbered by those who wanted Morocco back in the fold. There is no specific provision in the AU charter that bars any country from joining it. Morocco simply applied and the request was accepted by more than two-thirds of the 53 members. Morocco has been involved in intense lobbying and applied in July last year to rejoin the continental body. King Mohammed toured various African countries seeking support for the bid. No. While culturally the country's identity aligns with Arab states, its economic interests increasingly lie in Africa. This is a strategic move to continue exploring its interests in mining, construction, medical, insurance and banking sectors on the continent.

Archaeologist David Jacques, said: ""They... used the stump of the tree, about three metres high, as a wall."" The finds are being shown to United Nations heritage experts, who are currently visiting Stonehenge. Archaeologists are concerned a planned 2.9km tunnel being considered for the nearby A303 main road will damage the site. Discoveries have also shown stones were warmed up by the Mesolithic Period inhabitants and used in a hearth to emit heat in the earthy snug. Mr Jacques, a senior research fellow at the University of Buckingham, has worked at Blick Mead for over a decade, making a number of discoveries about the inhabitants. The tree stump created a wall height similar to a ""modern bungalow"". ""They've draped probably animal skins or thatch around the basin and connected it to a post so it's a very comfortable snug little place,"" he said. The wooden wall of the hollow was lined with flints and the large earthy pit created by the tree root lined with cobbles and decorated with ""exotic"" stones from outside the area. ""There are some clever and sophisticated things going on, the hot stones that they put into this little type of alcove wouldn't have been on fire,"" explained Mr Jacques. ""It looks more like these people have been using these hot stones as a type of storage heater so that you've got a lot of warmth coming off them."" Mr Jacques will meet the UN experts later to ask for the route to be moved closer to Salisbury and for hydrological assessments to be made. ""It's very likely the water flow would be reduced in and around the site,"" he said. ""It would take out all the organics and destroy all the animal bone we've been finding which is crucial for finding where they have been living and for getting radiocarbon dates from all the organics like pollen and wood.

The hospital, however, argued that the surgeries were conducted according to regulations, and pointed out that they encouraged her to seek psychiatric help instead of a third operation, which she refused. After mediation the woman agreed to accept 20,000 yuan ($3,100, Â£2,200) as compensation, said the report. On Weibo, some condemned the woman's husband, but others also chastised the woman. One top-voted comment read: ""It's purely an excuse, if her face was large then why did he decide to marry her in the first place? If he stopped loving her then he should have just said so."" It continued: ""This woman is also very silly to have believed that her face shape was the real reason for the divorce, she is lying to herself."" Said another Weibo user: ""Even if you had gone for facial surgery and made your face smaller, he would still have found other reasons to divorce you."" One person noted the sharp difference in the compensation amount and voiced suspicions: ""1.7 million was dropped to 20,000, it makes me wonder if she really did have a problem with her jaw."" Still others took the opportunity to crack jokes. ""What an odd reason for divorce! I wonder how square was this woman's square-shaped face? Like a television set? Microwave oven?"" Plastic surgery has long been a hot topic on Weibo. In December, users similarly expressed outrage when a Chinese man took out a newspaper advertisement pleading for his wife to go for plastic surgery. More than seven million cosmetic surgeries were performed in China in 2014. The industry's value, pegged at around 400bn yuan, is expected to double by 2019, according to the China Association of Plastics and Aesthetics.",0,5,4

It was the first time the 32-year-old Spaniard had driven the car for the Oxfordshire-based Marussia team. Inspectors from the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) visited the test track on Wednesday. Marussia said surgeons at Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge ""embarked on a lengthy procedure to address the serious head and facial injuries sustained by Maria in the accident"". It said: ""The operation began yesterday afternoon and she was in theatre until this morning. ""Maria remains in a critical but stable condition."" John Booth, team principal of the Marussia F1 Team, said: ""Maria emerged from theatre at Addenbrooke's Hospital this morning after a lengthy operation to address the serious head and facial injuries she received in the accident at Duxford Airfield yesterday. ""We are grateful for the medical attention that Maria has been receiving and her family would like to thank the Neurological and Plastics surgical teams. ""However, it is with great sadness that I must report that, due to the injuries she sustained, Maria has lost her right eye. ""Maria's care and the wellbeing of her family remain our priority at this time. Her family are at the hospital and we are doing everything possible to support them."" De Villota sustained her injuries after her car ""suddenly accelerated"" into the back of the support lorry, according to witnesses. BBC Radio Cambridgeshire presenter Chris Mann, who saw the accident, said: ""The top of her car and her helmet seemed to take the brunt of it. ""She didn't move for about 15 minutes."" He said De Villota had been driving at up to 200mph during the testing, but the car was travelling considerably slower at the time of the crash. Mr Booth said: ""With regard to the accident, we have embarked on a very comprehensive analysis of what happened and this work continues for the moment."" Messages of support have come in from the motor racing world, including ones from Ferrari driver and fellow Spaniard Fernando Alonso and Jenson Button. Formula 1 driver and BBC analyst Jaime Alguersari said in his weekly column : ""I was shocked to hear of the accident suffered by Maria de Villota. I know her and her family very well. I still don't know the cause of the accident. There are so many rumours but I want to wait to see what really happened. ""It's terribly sad. Maria is a fantastic person, as are her brothers and her father Emilio, who was one of Spain's first F1 drivers. ""She is a role model, especially for all the females who want to get into F1. So this is a very sad situation. ""Thankfully, she is not in a life-threatening situation so we have to look at the positive side. We will see Maria again."" Lewis Hamilton tweeted: ""Just heard about Maria's terrible accident at Duxford. I hope she pulls through. My thoughts and prayers are with her family at this time.""

Ms Teal was previously arrested for protesting against the tree removals. Charges against her and 13 others were dropped earlier this year. More stories from across Yorkshire Sheffield City Council maintain that the removal of street trees in the city is lawful and necessary. A ""pre-action protocol letter"" from the council's legal department to Ms Teal warned the authority will seek a High Court injunction to stop her, and others involved in ""direct action"", from taking part in future protests. The council said the process would give protesters ""a chance to further and finally consider their position"" before it begins legal proceedings on 12 July. Councillor Bryan Lodge, cabinet member for Environment and Street Scene, said there had been months of ""unlawful and costly disruption"" to tree replacement works in Sheffield by a small number of protesters. ""We continue to support the right to peacefully protest, and the majority of protesters who are doing so peacefully will not be affected,"" he added. ""But there is a big difference between this and direct action which deliberately and unlawfully stops works from being carried out."" Mr Lodge said protesters had been sent a letter several weeks ago confirming their actions were unlawful. ""Streets Ahead is not just about street trees, it's about ensuring we have roads, pavements and a street scene to be proud of for many years to come,"" he added. ""In addition, it presents us with a unique opportunity to sustainably manage, increase and maintain our diverse street tree stock over a 25 year period."" The council said, despite the letter, works were still being disrupted ""causing city-wide delays"".",1,5,5

""We are deeply ashamed of our cat, especially as he had convinced us that he had changed his criminal ways,"" his owner wrote to neighbours. Rachael Drouet created a leaflet for her neighbours in a bid to reunite the stolen items with their rightful owners.

together_glm,A colony of bats has been roosting in a church in North Yorkshire for more than a decade.,"A colony has been roosting in St Hilda's Church at Ellerburn, close to the North York Moors. But despite the church's best efforts the bats are not moving and are soiling the altar and church furniture, leaving the church with an ""appalling smell"". The creatures are protected by law and cannot be wilfully disturbed. Volunteers at the church have been working for the past decade to keep the altar, stonework and woodwork clean. But the bats, roosting in the higher areas of the church continually soil the interior of the building with urine and faeces. Church warden Liz Cowley said keeping the 11th Century building in good shape was difficult. She said: ""You can see the urine marks (on the altar), they won't go away. ""If people were coming in here damaging an ancient building like this, you would say it was criminal damage. ""The smell is appalling, it's a combination of ammonia from the urine and a musty smell from the droppings that catches at the back of the throat."" Members of the church had spent Â£10,000 trying to get the bats to move and had paid for specially-built lofts nearby. The Rev Paul Mothersdale, the Rector of St Hilda's Church, said a lot of money had been invested in trying to persuade the bats to move out of the church. The Rev Mothersdale said: ""We've tried to do everything that English Nature, or Natural England, have wanted us to do. ""Money has been spent, not only by the congregation, not only out of church funds, but local people have mucked in and helped. ""And yet we're no further forward, we're still as we were 10 years ago."" Lucy Bellini, of Natural England, said the bats had to be carefully monitored. Ms Bellini said: ""It is a really regionally important roost. ""Because of that we need to be sure that there are replacement roosts that are suitable and that the bats have found and are aware of and can move to before we allow the church to seal up access points and move the bats out of the church.""",1,5,4

He had previously opposed an assisted dying law, but said his illness has left him ""like a beached whale"" and in constant discomfort. ""My position has changed,"" he wrote to Baroness D'Souza. Stage and TV actor Lord Rix, who specialised in post-war ""Whitehall farce"" comedies, is receiving 24-hour care in a retirement home. ""My position has changed. As a dying man, who has been dying now for several weeks, I am only too conscious that the laws of this country make it impossible for people like me to be helped on their way, even though the family is supportive of this position and everything that needs to be done has been dealt with. ""Unhappily, my body seems to be constructed in such a way that it keeps me alive in great discomfort when all I want is to be allowed to slip into a sleep, peacefully, legally and without any threat to the medical or nursing profession. ""I am sure there are many others like me who having finished with life wish their life to finish. ""Only with a legal euthanasia Bill on the statute books will the many people who find themselves in the same situation as me be able to slip away peacefully in their sleep instead of dreading the night."" The crossbench peer voted against an Assisted Dying Bill in 2006 because of concerns that people with learning disabilities might become the unwilling victims of euthanasia. He has been a prominent campaigner for people with learning disabilities after his daughter was born with Down's syndrome. He said his children were ""absolutely supportive"" of his decision and that he has ""wrapped up"" his affairs and was ""ready to go"" to ""put an end to this misery, pain and discomfort"". ""I can't do anything but lie here thinking 'Oh Christ, why am I still here?' They won't let me die and that's all I want to do,"" he said. He added the doctors and nurses ""do their best for me"" but that it was ""not good enough because what I want is to die, and the law stops them from helping me with that"". He had discussed with his children the possibility of travelling to the Dignitas clinic in Switzerland, but felt it would be ""unfair to them to push them into a situation where they are helping me to die"". Lord Rix said he had not been given an estimate from doctors as to how long he will live, adding: ""I think it's wrong that people like me are stranded like this.

together_glm,A group of British nationals have been detained in Turkey after attempting to travel to Syria.,"The group, reported to be three men, two women and four children aged from two to 11, was held at Reyhanli, in Hatay province, near the Syrian border. Their intention in travelling to the region, where areas are controlled by Islamic State (IS) militants or an al-Qaeda affiliate, is not clear. The Foreign Office has said it is in contact with the Turkish authorities. The BBC's Mark Lowen said the information about the ages of the children had not been independently verified and it was too early to know where the group were intending to head to. ""Were they heading for one of the more moderate groups in Syria. Were they heading for the area controlled by al-Nusra, the al-Qaeda affiliate? Or were they heading to so-called Islamic State territory?"" he said. The group was taken to a police station in southern Turkey overnight, and then sent to the foreigners department awaiting deportation to the UK. They have undergone medical examinations and had their finger-prints taken. The United Nations estimates the number of foreign fighters joining militant groups is more than 25,000, from 100 different nations. About 600 Britons are believed to have gone to Syria or Iraq since IS seized control of large swathes of territory there. Most are thought to have volunteered as fighters for the militant Islamist group. Around half are believed to have later returned to the UK, the Metropolitan Police has said. The latest detentions come two weeks after three British teenagers were stopped from travelling into Syria from Turkey. The three - two aged 17 and one 19, from north-west London - were arrested following a tip-off from British police and flown back to the UK. They have since been released on police bail. They had flown to Turkey from Barcelona and were arrested at Sabiha Gokcen airport in Istanbul. Fadi Hakura, Turkey analyst for Chatham House, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the recent arrests showed the Turkish government was ""taking more effective measures to control the flow of fighters and supporters into Syria"". He said there was now ""more enhanced security and intelligence cooperation between Turkey and its Western counterparts, especially with the exchange of names that Turkey needs to prohibit [IS supporters] from crossing into Syria"". The Turkish government has said it cannot make a 560-mile border watertight and will act when it has prior warning. In February this year there were recriminations between British police and Turkish officials after three London schoolgirls disappeared from Turkey, apparently having crossed the border into Syria. Shamima Begum, Amira Abase, both 15, and Kadiza Sultana, 16 had flown to Istanbul and travelled to the border region.

A dissident republican group, widely referred to as the new IRA, said it carried out the attack. The organisation said Mr Ismay was targeted for training officers at Maghaberry Prison near Lisburn, County Antrim. Sue McAllister, director general of the Northern Ireland Prison Service, spent time with the Ismay family on Wednesday. She said they were ""devastated and beyond shock at what's happened"".

""We thought he would make a full recovery, we expected him to come back to work in due course, so we're all shocked, but particularly Sharon and her daughters."" Mrs McAllister condemned the behaviour of some paramilitary inmates at Maghaberry Prison, who reportedly cheered, smoked cigars and mocked wardens at the high-security jail when news of Mr Ismay's death filtered through. ""This was just unacceptable behaviour by a very small number of prisoners,"" said Mrs McAllister. ""My colleagues in Maghaberry dealt with it professionally, with great fortitude and with the courage they display on a daily basis.""

He admitted culpable homicide on the basis of diminished responsibility after saying he had no recollection of the killing at Dixon Avenue, Glasgow, on 24 September last year. Buksh will be sentenced on 27 June. The High Court in Glasgow heard that 43-year-old Mrs Buksh died after being struck on the head at least five times. Pathologists told the court that the lack of defensive injuries and the position of her body suggested she was assaulted as she slept. Following the attack, Buksh went to Cathcart Police Station and told an officer: ""I've come to hand myself in. I think my wife's dead. I hit her on the head. I did it."" The court was told that three psychiatrists described Buksh as suffering from an acute stress disorder at the time. Prosecutor Gordon Lamont said: ""The accused and his wife had been married for 25 years, but over the last 10 or 11 years their relationship appears to have broken down and they became increasingly estranged, albeit, still residing under the one roof. ""They slept separately and Mrs Buksh routinely slept on the sofa in the living room. Their children report that they barely spoke to each other."" Mr Lamont said the problems in the marriage intensified after Mrs Buksh went to Pakistan on holiday in May last year. He said she had become involved with another man and was making plans to move to Pakistan. The court also heard that two days before he killed his wife, Buksh went to Paisley Police Office and spoke with a support officer saying he feared his wife was going to take their youngest child, aged 10, to Pakistan and not return. He also made an emergency doctor's appointment and said he was suffering from stress and not sleeping. He was prescribed medication for stress. Defence counsel Sarah Livingstone said: ""My client has no memory of this incident. His amnesia is absolutely genuine. ""This is not a case where this man was a bad husband, there was no domestic abuse. This was an unhappy marriage, but however, unhappy it was it didn't justify killing his wife. ""He suffered an acute stress reaction. Three psychiatrists all agree that he was suffering from an abnormality of the mind.""

together_glm,A new crop of commercial meaderies are making the drink more palatable to modern drinkers.,"But what's brewing in this new crop of commercial meaderies - as they are known - is lot more refined from the drink that once decorated tables across medieval Europe. ""Do we have any mead makers or home brewers in the group?"" asks Ben Alexander, eying a crowd of a dozen or so people who have come to his Maine Meade Works, in Portland, on a rainy Friday for a tour. When no-one raises their hand, Mr Alexander launches into the full spiel. ""If you guys want to come around, I'll show you how this thing works,"" he says, gesturing to two ceiling-high columns of stainless steel filled with something resembling a mushy golden porridge. ""We mix up honey and water over there and we pump it through a hot water bath at 160 degrees [71C] in a stainless steel coil here. Each one produces about 50 to 75 gallons [227-340 litres] of mead a day,"" explains Mr Alexander. It's fair to say he is obsessed with mead. ""It's the quintessential local beverage - you can go anywhere in the world and find honey to make mead, and I think that's unique among alcoholic beverages,"" he gushes. After being introduced to the drink by a home brewer, Mr Alexander thought there were profits to be had in a commercial meadery. He founded Maine Mead Works in 2008, pouring his savings and money from friends and family into the business. His business has since grown, along with the popularity of mead in the US. It's now a seven-person operation that manufactures more than 7,500 cases a year, shipping them as far away as China. Mr Alexander is not the only one to have caught on to the commercial potential of mead. Vicky Rowe, the owner of mead information website GotMead, says interest in the product in the US has exploded in the past decade. ""We went from 30-40 meaderies making mead to somewhere in the vicinity of 250 in the last 10 years,"" she says. ""I like to say that everything old is new again - people come back to what was good once."" Even visitors to Mr Alexander's meadery agree. Tour participant Dirk Heseman admitted that while Maine Mead Works was the first meadery he'd actually visited, he has noticed that mead ""is becoming more and more available - similar to cider"". Just this year, commercial meaderies in the US have banded together to form an industry group, the American Mead Makers Association, to better share information and encourage growth in the industry. But there's a lot of work that needs to be done to improve the image of a drink long associated with Renaissance fairs and medieval re-enactments. ""I think our number one challenge as an industry is awareness of what mead is,"" says Mr Alexander. ""You ask 10 people in a room if they've ever heard of mead, and two of them might say, 'yes', and only one of them has had a very positive experience."" The mead of the past was often sweet, and didn't appeal to many drinkers",1,5,5
together_glm,A petition calling on the EU to stop the talks on the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership has been launched.,"The petition calls on the EU and its member states to stop the talks on the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership or TTIP. It also says they should not ratify a similar deal that has already been done between the EU and Canada. It says some aspects pose a threat to democracy and the rule of law. One of the concerns mentioned in the petition is the idea of tribunals that foreign investors would be able to use in some circumstances to sue governments. There is a great deal of controversy over exactly what this system, known as Investor State Dispute Settlement, would enable companies to do, but campaigners see it as an opportunity for international business to get compensation for government policy changes that adversely affect them. This kind of provision exists in many bilateral trade and investment agreements. Friends of the Earth have published new research on the impact they have had on EU countries. Information about these cases is not always made public, but the group says that going back to 1994, foreign investors have sought compensation of almost €30bn (£24bn) from 20 states. Where the results are known (a small minority of the total), the tribunals have awarded total compensation of €3.5bn (about £2.8bn). In Britain, the possible implications of this provision for the National Health Service have been especially controversial. Campaigners believe that the investor tribunals would make it harder to reverse any decisions to contract services out to international healthcare firms. John Hilary of War on Want said: TTIP ""will make it impossible for any future government to repeal the Health & Social Care Act and bring the NHS back into public hands"". The petition lists a number of other areas where its signatories believes European standards would suffer if the TTIP negotiations are completed and the Canada deal is ratified: employment, social, environmental, privacy and consumer protection. The European Commission says the EU will not have to sacrifice its high standards. It also says investor protection provisions are important for investment flows and have in general worked well. But it accepts there is a need for improvement and is trying to achieve that in its bilateral negotiations. The petition has been organised as an exercise called a European Citizens' Initiative which can lead to a public hearing in the European Parliament and require the European Commission to give a formal response explaining why it is accepting or rejecting what the petitioners call for. The European Commission has already said that the petition doesn't qualify as such an Initiative. Campaigners have launched a legal challenge to this decision.",1,5,5

The murder, filmed on CCTV and on mobile phones, sparked outrage. The Church of the Almighty God cult is banned in China but claims to have millions of members. Following the brutal killing in May, Chinese authorities said that they detained hundreds of members of the cult, reports the BBC's Martin Patience in Beijing. Interviewed in prison later, one of the defendants, Zhang Lidong showed no remorse. He said: ""I beat her with all my might and stamped on her too. She was a demon. We had to destroy her."" The group had entered a small McDonalds branch in Zhaoyuan in Shandong province last May soliciting phone numbers and hoping to recruit members to their cult. Ms Wu was waiting in the restaurant with her seven-year-old son and when she refused to give her number, an act which prompted the beating while they screamed at other diners to keep away or they would face the same fate. The public face of the Church of the Almighty God is a website full of uplifting hymns and homilies. But its core belief is that God has returned to earth as a Chinese woman to wreak the apocalypse. The only person who claims direct contact with this god is a former physics teacher, Zhao Weishan, who founded the cult 25 years ago and has since fled to the United States, says BBC China Editor Carrie Gracie. No-one knows exactly where he is, but much of the website's message of outright hostility to the Chinese government is delivered in English as well as Chinese.

Last month, the Supreme Court ruled that the anthem must be played in every cinema before a film is screened. Some 20 people have been held in Kerala and Tamil Nadu since then for remaining seated during the anthem.

Senior police official Sateesh Bino told the NDTV news channel that the writer-activist ""is being questioned for his controversial post on the national anthem on Facebook"" and had been charged with sedition. Earlier this month, 12 people were arrested at a cinema in Kerala, after they remained seated while the national anthem played. The cinemagoers, who were attending an international film festival, were later freed but they face charges of ""failure to obey an order issued by a public servant, thereby causing obstruction or annoyance to others"".

But referring to the city's high homicide rate, she said ""too many continue to die"". ""The focus has been too much on the leadership of the department and not enough on the crime fighting,"" she told reporters, adding: ""We need to get the crime surge under control."" The city has seen a sharp increase in violence since Freddie Gray's death on 19 April, with 155 homicides this year, a 48% increase over the same period last year. On Tuesday, the police department announced that an outside organisation will review its response to the civil unrest that followed Mr Gray's death.

Read more about the UK's referendum on the EU Alexander Boris de Pfeffel Johnson, to give him his full name, was born in New York and is descended from Turkish, French and German stock. He describes himself as a ""one-man melting pot"". He first made a name for himself in journalism, including a stint as Brussels correspondent for the right-wing Daily Telegraph newspaper and editor of The Spectator magazine. His humorous persona led him to become a fixture on various television programmes, including the satirical BBC panel show Have I Got News For You. He still has a lucrative and entertaining column in the Daily Telegraph, in which august forum he explained the reasons for his decision on the EU. As a politician, he has been a Conservative member of parliament for two constituencies, Henley from 2001 to 2008 and then Uxbridge and South Ruislip from 2015. Lest you think he was putting his feet up between parliamentary mandates, he is also currently serving the second of two terms as mayor of London, no mean feat in a city where the centre-left Labour Party has dominated in recent decades. That's indicative of the position Mr Johnson has carved out for himself as one of the most charismatic politicians in the UK who has wide appeal beyond Conservative heartlands - polling has suggested that his stance on the EU referendum may sway some undecided voters.

Freezing care provider fees to save money was no long sustainable, it said. Ministers say extra money will help NHS and social care services work together. The survey, which was completed by 147 directors of adult social services for councils in England, suggests that funding reductions to social care budgets have totalled £4.6bn since 2010 - a 31% overall reduction. Budgets for adult social care - which provides practical support to people due to illness, disability, old age or a low income - will reduce by a further £500m in cash terms this year, it said. ""Taking the growth in numbers of older and disabled people into account, this means that an additional £1.1bn would be needed to provide the same level of service as last year,"" the report warned. It said some councils had made savings in the past by freezing fees paid to providers, but care providers were now also facing financial problems. Some companies - particularly those in southern England - are struggling to attract staff, amid increasing concern about the quality of care, it said. ""What is at stake is the continuing capacity of adult social care to sustain services to those in greatest need,"" ADASS president Ray James said. ""In virtually all our authorities, the number in need is growing, while the complexity of their needs is increasing."" ADASS called for the government to ""protect essential care and support services to the most vulnerable members of our community"".

The BBC has launched an online guide to the care system for the over-65s. The ""care calculator"" covers residential care and the support provided in people's own homes, for tasks such as washing and dressing. Users can submit their postcode and find out how much each service costs where they live in the UK. There is also a dedicated BBC Cost of Care website, with news stories, analysis and video. The spokesman said: ""Increasing budgets isn't the only solution. By working innovatively and joining up health and social care we can improve care and also save money.""

I was here on 25 January when riot police forced us out and by the 28th, we were back following the violence. I've been sleeping here most of the time since. Our social network was established in 2005, when there was a democratic opening around the time of the presidential elections. People from different backgrounds all met through blogging and hoped to use technology for social change. It meant we have all gained good contacts, experience and strong networks. I like to think the social network is the people itself. Things like Facebook, Twitter, SMS and phones are just social tools. When they blocked Facebook and shut down technology, our network still operated because it's about people. Internet activists are also people and a lot of our organising, social work and relationships are developed offline. This is something that people dreamt of but didn't anticipate happening in reality. If anything, it shows that all the effort we put in over the past few years has not been wasted. It has climaxed into this critical mass of people you see in the square. At the moment I'm not getting a lot of internet connection. I'm trying not to drain my phone battery.

together_glm,England came within 25 runs of a famous victory in the first Test against Pakistan after a dramatic finish at the Dubai International Cricket Stadium.,"Pakistan seemed to be cruising to a draw before debutant Adil Rashid - who returned 0-163 in the first innings - turned the match with five wickets. Needing 99 to win, England sent out Jos Buttler and Ben Stokes in the top four. But they were eventually beaten by the fading light, finishing 25 runs short of a famous victory on 74-4. The tourists could not find the boundary frequently enough before the umpires brought the teams off, with Joe Root 33 not out. However, this was a hugely impressive performance from England and one that will fill them with confidence ahead of the second Test in Dubai, which begins on Thursday. After England concluded their innings on 598-9 in the morning, Pakistan looked assured at 113-3 shortly after tea, leading by 38 with seven second-innings wickets remaining. But the match turned when veteran batsman Younus Khan, playing in his 102nd Test match, mistimed a wild heave to give Rashid his first Test wicket - caught at point by Stokes. Rashid - whose figures in the first innings were the worst ever by a debutant - then quickly added a second victim, having Asad Shafiq caught behind for six. The door was opened for England, and Rashid and Moeen Ali barged through it as they polished off the last five wickets for 14 runs. Pakistan skipper Misbah ul-Haq - who had played with restraint for his 51 - inexplicably aimed an uncharacteristic slog at Moeen and was bowled. Moeen then removed Wahab Riaz caught behind, before Rashid claimed the final three wickets - all superbly caught at first slip by James Anderson. England sensed an unlikely victory, but their reorganised batting order could not score quickly enough as Pakistan's tactic of spin from both ends and fielders on the boundary brought them regular wickets. Makeshift opener Buttler was trapped lbw for four, Moeen and Stokes were caught on the boundary in quick succession, and Jonny Bairstow was stumped attempting a big shot. However, in truth it was mistakes earlier in the match that ultimately proved more costly as England fell just short of their first win on the subcontinent since beating India in Kolkata in 2012. In Pakistan's first innings, Ian Bell dropped Mohammad Hafeez (98) and Shafiq (107) at slip early in their innings. And Shoaib Malik, who made 245, was dismissed off a no-ball by Stuart Broad. England captain Alastair Cook, whose record-breaking 263 in the first innings was ultimately in vain, admitted England were frustrated to come so close to victory. ""We'd have liked another three or four overs at the end but that's the way it goes,"" he said. ""I can't fault the guys for hanging in there on that wicket. ""The pitch did deteriorate and spun more today which gave us hope, so it's a bit of a bittersweet finish. We knew we had to put the pressure on Pakistan and then on the last day you never know.

together_glm,Former Celtic and Bolton manager Neil Lennon has been appointed as the new manager of Hibernian.,"His previous jobs were at Celtic and Bolton, but moving to the second tier of Scottish football was no hindrance to him returning to work at Easter Road. Lennon saw the vacancy as an opportunity, and that was enough to encourage Hibs that a figure of his profile and experience would accept a role in the Championship. Even though his last job in Scotland involved leading a team on Champions League duty, Lennon's mind has not been swayed by haughtiness. The appointment of the former Celtic manager as successor to Alan Stubbs suits both parties, because it is mutually beneficial. Success is alluring, and Hibs offer Lennon the chance to accumulate more achievements. He was immediately engaged in crisis management at his previous club Bolton, but will find stability, potential and accomplishment at Easter Road. The demand will be to deliver promotion, but that will not seem daunting when the majority of the squad that pushed Rangers for a while last season then won the Scottish Cup is still in place. Lennon's task is to refine and bolster the team, when new managers are often faced with a period of overhaul. Stubbs left the club on an emotional high after delivering their first Scottish Cup in 114 years, but before the final against Rangers there was a tangible sense of exasperation that promotion had been missed. Hibs were entitled to feel that it was an unnecessary failure given their circumstances. The club is about to embark on a third season in the Championship, but by most other measures they can be considered a top-flight outfit. The budget will be significantly more than the rest of the teams in the division, the training ground at East Mains and facilities are first-class, the football side of the business is stable and well-run by George Craig, the club's head of football operations, the squad is full of talent. Lennon can rely on consistently assured performances from the likes of David Gray, Darren McGregor, Paul Hanlon, Lewis Stevenson, John McGinn, Fraser Fyvie, Dylan McGeouch, James Keatings and Jason Cummings. Some minor issues remain, such as who will fill the goal next season, but the challenge is more on adding depth and strength of will to the squad and man-management. McGinn, one of the most reliably effective players in the Championship last season, has already insisted that he remains committed to Hibs despite the failure to achieve promotion. The 21-year-old midfielder provides the kind of industry and spirit that a team can be built around. There may be critical decisions to make, though, since Cummings is entering the final year of his contract and so represents a sellable asset. He is a regular goalscorer, though, and Stubbs had to sign Anthony Stokes on loan last January to provide some support up front. These are tweaks compared to the amount of work Stubbs had to carry out when he was appointed two years ago. Hibs are ready to be guided forward, not waiting to be rescued.

He was also ordered to carry out 150 hours' unpaid work at Highbury Corner Magistrates' Court. District judge Susan Williams also ordered him to pay Â£145 in costs and charges. She said that, although Carlisle had made a ""positive contribution"" to others through football, she had to sentence him for the risk his ""erratic"" driving had created. ""If you are not in control of your vehicle in a road in central London you represent a danger to people,"" she said.

This choice was Stefanini and that remains the French proposal,"" said spokesman Stephane Le Foll. Observers say most Vatican appointments are confirmed within six weeks and that this long silence should be read as a rejection.

Appointments affected include scans and consultations with specialists - including those for cancer patients. The British Medical Association said such incentives were ""misguided"". At least nine clinical commissioning groups (CCGs) were offering GP practices payments for hitting targets, according to Pulse's investigation. In one case, Birmingham South Central CCG was offering practices more than Â£11,000 to reduce new outpatient attendances, follow-ups, A&E attendances and emergency admissions by 1%, compared with 2014/15. It said the schemes, which exclude cancer referrals, were designed to ""incentivise best quality practice"" and ""drive improvements in the quality of primary medical care"". ""Our priority is to ensure that patients have access to services that they need, when they need them,"" said a spokesperson for Birmingham South Central CCG. Another CCG told Pulse it had considered the ""full impact"" of the incentive scheme and was ""confident that there is no conflict of interest"". Pulse said that one scheme had already been looked at by the General Medical Council, the body which regulates medical standards in the UK, after local GP leaders expressed their concern. The magazine pointed out that initial hospital referrals for cancer patients should happen within two weeks of a GP first suspecting the condition. Dr Chand Nagpaul, chairman of the GPs committee of the doctors' trade union the British Medical Association, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that such schemes were a ""financial contaminant"" to patient-doctor trust. He said: ""It's short-sighted and misguided of CCGs to introduce such mechanisms, because they do lead to the potential for patients questioning the motives of GP referrals. ""We believe it is far more appropriate for CCGs to introduce clinical pathways that ensure patients are referred appropriately rather than these crude, salesman-like bonuses which pay GPs simply to make reduction to referrals in numerical terms."" Dr Peter Melton is local GP and clinical chief officer for North East Lincolnshire CCG, which offers the equivalent of more than Â£6,000 to practices that reduce outpatient referrals to the same level as the 25% with the lowest referral rates (which include two-week urgent cancer referrals) in 2014/15. He said the CCG was already among the best in England for referring suspected cancer patients to a consultant within two weeks and the scheme was not about avoiding sending people to hospital. ""It is not focussing on referral reduction per se but on better clinical and quality standards for the patient,"" he explained.

together_glm,Government records from the 17th Century show that gibbons were once widespread across half of China.,"Today, China has between 26 and 28 Hainan gibbons left, but government records that date back to the 17th Century show that gibbons were once widespread across half of the country. The apes began to disappear from the documents about 150 years ago, corresponding with population growth. The study is published in the Proceedings of the Royal Society B. Hainan gibbons are now limited to a few isolated patches of forest in the south west of China. They live in just four social groups, one of which was only discovered a few weeks ago. Understanding this population crash has been difficult, but the old government documents have helped to reveal when and how the numbers fell. Dr Sam Turvey, from the Zoological Society of London, said: ""China is one of the few places in the world that has a very very rich, long historical record. ""Because it has had such a complex bureaucracy for so long, there has been a lot of need for reporting - not just numbers of households for tax purposes and things like that, but also in terms of the kinds of natural resources that were available in the immediate environment."" These included records of animals, including gibbons, he said. ""We looked at the pattern of disappearance of gibbons through time and how that varied from place to place and the different environmental conditions and human pressures that were also present in these places."" The archives show that gibbons were a common sight in about 20 provinces in China well into the 17th and 18th Century. However, Dr Turvey said it was ""a stark contrast to their very imperilled position today"". ""We see a really steep increase in population decline and real population collapse across China about 100-150 years ago,"" he added. ""And this correlates with demographic expansion in China towards the end of the Imperial era and through the 20th Century, and the massive increase in deforestation and human population growth through the time of the Chinese Republic and the establishment of the communist party."" The researchers said a better understanding of the animals' decline would help them to establish a conservation plan for the country's last few Hainan gibbons. Dr Turvey said: ""It is an incredible privilege to be able to see gibbons in China in the wild. ""The Hainan gibbon is such as rare species, but knowing that this species is still hanging on there gives you hope that conservation will be able to bring that population back from the brink.""

Lee, 84, has never explained why she stopped writing. She doesn't give interviews - ""Hell, no"" was her response to a request several decades ago - and that silence has only added to the intrigue. But her close friend Thomas Lane Butts, a retired minister in her hometown, Monroeville, Alabama, says she once told him the reason. Sitting on a pew in the Methodist church which the Lee family still attends, he described to me how she suddenly brought the subject up one night over dinner in New York. ""She asked me, 'You ever wonder why I didn't write anything else?' And I said, 'Along with several million other people, yes, I had wondered about that.' And she said, 'Well, what do you think?'"" Speaking in his slow southern drawl, the Rev Butts, who just turned 80, suggested to her that she had already written a great book and therefore didn't need to compete with herself. ""And when I got through she said, 'You're all wrong.' I said, 'Alright, smart Alec. You tell me.' She said, 'I would not go through all the deprivation of privacy through which I went for this book again for any amount of money.' ""And she said, 'I did not need to write another book. I said what I wanted to say in that book.'"" Harper Lee called it a simple tale about the ""conflict of the human soul"" and Monroeville, Alabama, is where she drew her inspiration. The story depicts the segregated South of her childhood, during the Depression. It was published at the height of the civil rights struggle. The Rev Butts grew up 10 miles outside Monroeville. By the late 1950s, he says, he was a ""fuzzy-cheeked young preacher"" campaigning for an end to segregation. He had met Martin Luther King Jr and signed a petition to boycott buses. The Ku Klux Klan had left a burning cross on his front lawn. He says To Kill a Mockingbird was not well received in Monroeville when it was published. ""The people who were hard racist did not like it because of the implication of the book,"" the Rev Butts told me. ""The book revealed racism and that always frightens a racist - when you pull the cover off them. ""Those of us who stood up for civil rights were much encouraged by the book because in a very skilful and subtle way it addressed itself for justice."" But these days, the Rev Butts says, there is enormous civic pride in Monroeville. The old courthouse, which Hollywood re-created for the film, now houses a museum to Harper Lee and the town's other literary icon, Truman Capote. Capote was a childhood friend of hers and is thought to be the inspiration for the Dill character in To Kill a Mockingbird.

India is the third-largest economy in Asia but has been struggling with inflation and currency weakness. Since July last year, the Indian rupee has seen one of the biggest declines among Asian currencies, dropping more than 27% against the US dollar.

The BBC's Yogita Limaye in Mumbai said that just a year ago India was aspiring for double-digit growth. But a global slowdown has reduced external demand, and high inflation coupled with a weak rupee has made things more expensive within the country.

With provisional results in from more than 40% of polling stations earlier on Wednesday, Mr Odinga had 42% of the vote compared with Mr Kenyatta's 53%. However, Mr Odinga's allies remain confident that he will gain ground as results from his strongholds, including the Coast Province, are declared.

The BBC's Solomon Mugera in the capital, Nairobi, says Kenyans are becoming increasingly anxious about the delay in finalising the results.

It's busy. The building has regenerated the area around Melton Mowbray's railway station, once a muddy pot-holed piece of wasteland where those in the know parked for free. Now the council offices link the station to a park and the town centre. It was partly paid for with insurance money after a fire destroyed the old offices on the other side of town. A supermarket moved in to replace it and helped with the money too, putting the council on a firm financial footing. But that was four years ago and the crisis is a different one today. It's being experienced by all local authorities - cuts in central government funding which threaten the services they provide. Mr Rhodes is also deputy leader of Leicestershire County Council, with responsibility for finance. Leicestershire is historically the poorest funded council in the country because of a quirk of Whitehall recalculations, going back a quarter of a century since the poll tax, or community charge, was scrapped. At the moment councils get income from council tax, a share of the business rates, any income they generate themselves from services plus a grant from central government. It's the grant cut which is causing them grief. What's called the ""core funding"" is worked out by the number of homes multiplied by a set amount. And each authority has a different value set per dwelling. If we look at Surrey, which is top of the table, the amount will be £1,686 by 2019/20. Nottinghamshire is mid-table at £1,482, Derbyshire is in the lower reaches with £1,422 per dwelling and then comes Leicestershire at £1,354. ""The funding system is chaotic,"" says Byron Rhodes. ""It doesn't reflect real need. Look at Oxfordshire which is an interesting example,"" he says with a glint in his eye. Could he possibly be referring to the prime ministerial plea to the county council about cutbacks to services there? ""If we had the same funding as Oxfordshire, we'd have £50m a year extra. If we had the same as Surrey, we'd have £100m more. We'd be partying everyday if we had that kind of money."" Leicestershire have been helped with a small share of what's been called transitional funding - about £300m to help councils following pressure from Conservative MPs. Think back to the vote on Sunday trading. With a majority of only 17 in the Commons, the Conservatives lost the vote when 20 odd rebelled. Last month there would've been another rebellion, including some of our own Tory MPs in the East Midlands, if something wasn't done to improve the local government finance settlement over the next four years. The money has gone largely to shire counties. Leicestershire got £6.6m spread over two years, enough to save some services from closure. But it's a drop in the ocean for an authority with a £19m black hole in the budget every year after the latest cutbacks. Labour have protested that 83% of the councils getting transition funding are Conservative-run. Many Labour-run",1,5,4

together_glm,"More than 5,500 children are in foster care in Scotland, with 4,400 families and carers, but 750 more are urgently needed to meet the demands of the care system.","Research carried out by the Fostering Network suggests almost half of fostered young people are already living with their third foster family since going into care. The group has warned that 750 more foster carers are ""urgently"" needed to meet the demands of the care system. It urged people to ""open their hearts and homes"" to vulnerable youngsters. Currently, more than 5,500 children are in foster care in Scotland, living with 4,400 families and carers. The Fostering Network surveyed 250 children, teenagers and foster carers across Scotland and discovered that many young people had failed to find stability. Almost half were already living with their third family, a quarter were with their fourth family and about 20 were living with their 10th family since going into care. There was a particular need for homes to be found for vulnerable teenagers, siblings and disabled children, the study found. Carla, 23, was taken into care at the age of 12 and had eight foster homes before moving in with the Randalls. ""Looking back now I realised that the Randalls saved my life,"" she said. ""I never understood the extent of the neglect and abuse I had endured until I came to live with a 'normal' loving family. ""They were just always themselves, the smallest details meant so much to me. ""They nurtured a young, angry, untrusting teenager to become a positive, empathetic and successful young woman."" The Fostering Network said instability had a detrimental effect on the child's education and wellbeing, while finding a stable foster carer from the outset could lead to improved relationships and a happier childhood. Sara Lurie, director of the Fostering Network Scotland, said: ""As each year passes, we see more and more children coming into care. ""We need people who can open their heart, and their homes, to vulnerable children and young people and use their skills to help support them to reach their full potential. ""In particular we need people who have the skills, patience and passion to look after teenagers who may have had a really tough time and be facing some real challenges, and to offer them love, stability and security. ""A good foster carer will believe in the ambition of the children in their care in the same way they'd believe in the ambition of their biological family members."" Apologies for the delay, see below as requested. A Scottish government spokeswoman said: ""Giving young people security is paramount and we have done a great deal of work with our partners across local government and the third sector to improve how we intervene early when there is a problem within families to find appropriate solutions quickly. ""We have also expanded the age at which young people can remain in foster care as part of the continuing care provisions and the support available when they transition into independent living.""",1,5,5

Morocco controls two-thirds of Western Sahara and sees it as part of its historic territory. However some, including the UN, see Western Sahara as Africa's last colony. Africa Live: More on this and other stories Find out more about Western Sahara A referendum was promised in 1991 but never carried out due to wrangling over who was eligible to vote. Thousands of Sahrawi refugees still live in refugee camps in Algeria - some have been there for 40 years. It is not clear what happens next but Western Sahara is hopeful that a committee set up by the AU will address the issues that both sides have raised. Some AU delegates said that it would be easier to resolve the issue with Morocco inside the AU. Sidi Mohammed, a Western Sahara official, told the BBC that Morocco's return to the AU means that it would now be expected to put ""in practice decisions taken by the AU with regard to a referendum in Western Sahara"". Mr Mohammed dismissed the suggestion that Morocco would now seek to get the AU to change its position, saying that the no country could unilaterally change the AU fundamental agreement, saying it opposed colonisation. In his speech at the AU summit, King Mohammed VI of Morocco said the readmission was not meant to divide the continental body. No. Algeria has always been a big supporter of Western Sahara's Polisario Front and it had wanted Morocco to accept independence of the territory as a condition for readmission. Zimbabwe and South Africa were also supportive of this stance but they were outnumbered by those who wanted Morocco back in the fold. There is no specific provision in the AU charter that bars any country from joining it. Morocco simply applied and the request was accepted by more than two-thirds of the 53 members. Morocco has been involved in intense lobbying and applied in July last year to rejoin the continental body. King Mohammed toured various African countries seeking support for the bid. No. While culturally the country's identity aligns with Arab states, its economic interests increasingly lie in Africa. This is a strategic move to continue exploring its interests in mining, construction, medical, insurance and banking sectors on the continent.

BBC North America editor Jon Sopel said the unsolicited statement put out by the White House suggested Downing Street had reacted angrily to the article.

But his power, timing and focus returned in a supremely confident display at Glasgow's Hydro on Saturday night as he clinched the vacant WBA World Super-Lightweight title - and entered the record books as the first Scot to win world titles at three weights. Italy's Michele Di Rocco, at 34 a year older than Burns, hadn't lost a fight since September 2007. He arrived with a record of 40 wins and a draw from 42 bouts. He left a lesser figure. The referee deemed the man from Assisi to be in no state to continue in the eighth round, the result of a welter of blows to his head and body and made all the more unbearable by the hostile acoustic energy generated by 8,000 Scottish fans. Surely, for Burns, this was time to shout about his record, the ideal moment to counter all those who had written him off and questioned the wisdom of him leaving trainer Billy Nelson two years ago to work with Tony Sim in Essex? No. Instead, the champion spoke of his disbelief at the ease of his victory, his gratitude that he was safe, of his thanks to promoter Eddie Hearn, manager Alex Morrison and coach Sim for believing in him, and of his desire to celebrate with a fast-food burger and 20 chicken nuggets. ""When I got in the ring after the fight, I said, 'You've done it! You've done it!',"" reported a beaming Hearn at the post-fight media conference. ""And you know what Ricky said? 'Can you get a picture with me and Michael Buffer [the legendary American boxing ring announcer]?'"" When he has time to reflect during a well-earned holiday, Burns will take immense satisfaction at being only the third British-born fighter, after Bob Fitzsimmons and Duke McKenzie, to be a three-weight world champion. In Scottish terms, his achievements must mean that he is in the very top tier of boxing greats, comfortably mentioned in the same breath as former world champions Benny Lynch, Walter McGowan, Jackie Paterson, Ken Buchanan and Jim Watt, for example. Burns' record stands at 40 wins from 46 bouts. Remarkably, 11 of those have been world title fights. Buchanan's exploits in the United States add lustre to his legacy, but while Burns may never have fought someone like Roberto Duran, should Hearn manage to set up a bout against Cincinnati's Adrien Broner, the four-time world champion stripped of the WBA title because he could not make the weight, then Burns could achieve little more in the sport. ""There are some big fights out there for me,"" said Burns. ""I want to fight the top names. I will fight anybody. I do super-lightweight comfortably and lightweight is still an option. I would fight Terence Crawford again if it came down to it. ""That's nearly two years I have been with Tony and things have just started clicking.

Earlier in the year, Russia enacted a law that gave the government powers to block websites without explanation. In March, Moscow blocked the blog of Mr Navalny, along with two news sites and a organisation run by Garry Kasparov - a vocal critic of the Russian government. In a statement, Russia's prosecutor general's office said the blocks were imposed because of the sites' role in helping stage illegal protests. Earlier this week, Twitter blocked access to an anti-Kremlin account that often publishes leaked government documents, following a request by Russia's federal communications agency Roskomnadzor.

Billy Mckay sent a shot over from close range. Alex Fisher nodded a diving header wide. Carl Tremarco miscued a volley. Greg Tansey did draw a save from Alan Mannus when he rasped in an effort from outside the box, but Richie Foran's side never looked likely to find the net. Their best opportunity came immediately after the Saints went ahead, when Tansey fed Cole, who seemed to panic in a terrific position and shot straight at Mannus. Cole's dismissal ended the contest when he appeared to be cautioned twice for challenging referee Stephen Finnie's decision not to award a foul. St Johnstone were merciless and could have had more. With just one win from their last 21 league games, Inverness look deep in trouble. Tommy Wright's side deserve so much credit. Saints were tactically brilliant, so strong defensively and ruthlessly capitalised on their man advantage. They took one of their few first-half chances when Michael Coulson broke down the left and sent a dangerous ball across the six-yard box. Owain Fon Williams could only parry into the danger area, Cummins' shot was blocked but Maclean followed up to force it home. They should have had another when Craig's superb curling corner flew all the way to the back post where Cummins slid in and somehow knocked it over from two yards. Craig, in his 300th appearance for the club, coolly converted a spot-kick after Cummins was tripped to seal the points. Cummins then slammed home after Miller danced around the area to tee him up, before Craig cracked the bar amid the late flurry. With a tendency to finish the season strongly, and just a three-point gap to Rangers, the Perth side look capable of something special this term. Inverness CT manager Richie Foran: ""It is a tough time of the season to be sitting bottom, and I need real men to stand up to that, but not enough of them did that today. ""It is pure luck we are still in it and it is only four points. I sound like a broken record but one win changes it - that is the truth. But I need braver players with more passion and desire.",1,4,4

""We were [rehearsing] in the tent for about a week and a half, then we had to move to bigger studios in Hollywood where we are working on the rest of the show,"" she told Houston radio station Mix 96.5. ""And then we will send that equipment to Houston where we will finish rehearsals. Fans can expect a performance that spans my career so far."" She has a high standard to live up to - notably Prince's show in 2007, which took place in the middle of a Miami thunderstorm and is widely accepted as the greatest performance in the event's history, if not Prince's career. Here are some of the other most memorable - and surprising - moments from the last 30 years. Super Bowl performers get a very strict 12-minute time limit, so most performers cram their set with as much music as possible. Not Michael Jackson. After shooting onto the stage at the Pasadena Rose Bowl, he stood completely still, staring at the world for a full 90 seconds. Ninety. It was a master class in ratcheting expectation to a fever pitch. And the screams when he launched into Jam (not one of his best songs) proved he knew what he was doing. Brilliantly, Jackson staged this entire performance while wearing a jacket it looked like he'd borrowed from Muammar Gaddafi. Beat that, Gaga. Baby, he was born to run... and slide on his knees... and crotch slam a TV camera. In his autobiography, The Boss explains the incident like this: ""Too much adrenalin, a late drop, too much speed, here I come, Mikeâ€¦ BOOM! ""And I'm onto his camera, the lens implanted into my chest with one leg off the stage. I use his camera to push myself back up andâ€¦ BLAM! BORN TO RUN!"" It led to the memorable headline: ""America Attacked by Bruce Springsteen's crotch"" - but it didn't stop the star delivering one of the most powerful and energetic Super Bowl shows in recent history. Even if they were fined for over-running by 40 seconds. Coldplay were the headline act at last year's Super Bowl in Santa Clara - but someone forgot to tell Beyonce. She only performed one song, Formation, underscoring its message of black pride and power with back-up dancers dressed in leather body suits and black berets reminiscent of the Black Panthers movement. Some of her dancers were even pictured holding up a sign declaring ""Justice 4 Mario Woods"" - a 26-year-old black man who was shot dead by armed police in San Francisco two months earlier. The performance heralded the arrival of her unapologetically political album, Lemonade, later in the year. You can't out-diva Diana, something she was determined to prove when she strode onto the pitch in Tempe, Arizona, for Super Bowl XXX.

Following on, he then made 68 in Surrey's 166-3 to keep Hampshire at bay and prompt handshakes at 16:50 BST. The draw sees third-placed Hampshire claim 12 points, while Surrey take 10 points and stay sixth in Division One. Burns' epic effort saw him stay in the field for all but 10 overs of the entire match, as he defied Hampshire's bowling efforts on a flat Oval pitch. The left-hander was dropped twice in the slip cordon in his career-best 219, but was the only one to resist as Ian Holland (3-37) dismissed Tom Curran (53), Amar Virdi and Mark Footitt to force the follow-on after Surrey began the day on 410-7. Mark Stoneman (47) and Burns then put on an opening stand of 109 before Holland's medium pace had Stoneman lbw and Scott Borthwick bowled in a single over. Sean Ervine became the only man to dismiss Burns in 756 minutes of play when he missed a ball down the leg side, but Jason Roy and Dominic Sibley continued on until the conclusion. Surrey captain Rory Burns told BBC Radio London: ""I'm really pleased that we've fought that hard to get the draw and the extra five points, and obviously pretty happy with how I've played. ""We had to bat seven sessions to get us to safety and that's all I was thinking. ""There were some jitters in the nineties and I got a lifeline, which was quite nice. When I was getting close to 200, I was more thinking about the situation of getting to the follow-on mark. ""They're a good side and they played really well. We managed to hold on and get ourselves to safety, so it was honours even on a flat wicket.""",1,4,5

Union Unison said it was ""bitterly disappointed"" with the decision. Regional officer, Helen Metcalf, said: ""This is a devastating blow for the 2,700 teaching assistants in the county, who now face being driven into poverty and relying on food banks through losing Â£200 - Â£400 per month of their salary."" She said there was ""no option"" but to lodge a formal dispute and ballot members for industrial action. Teaching assistant Tony Lowery, said: ""It is really devastating for my family because I'm the main wager. I don't mean things like going on holidays or a second car, I mean things like food on the table and clothes on our backs."" Liberal Democrat councillors voted unanimously against the plans. Councillor Owen Temple said the affected staff would ""find themselves the poorest teaching assistants in the North East"" and the council was ""very likely to face legal challenge"". The council's corporate director of resources, Don McLure, said there was a ""real risk"" that, under the present contracts, other council employees could make claims for equal pay with the teaching assistants. He said: ""I fully understand the position teaching assistants are in but they are very valued, they do a great job and support the education of our children, but we are doing this to bring them in line with the rest of our workforce.""

At the party's weekly press briefing, I asked the Welsh Conservative leader Andrew RT Davies, who was elected on the list, whether he'd stand as a constituency candidate in his home turf of the Vale of Glamorgan but he said he hadn't thought about it. Presumably those are the kind of decisions they will now feel more confident contemplating. The party will also have a huge amount of new data on voters which it'll be able to call upon and the belief that campaigning hard on the NHS helped the Tories cross the line in places like the Vale of Clwyd and Gower. The Conservatives feel it's them, rather than any of the other opposition parties, who have become the repository of votes from those who are disaffected by the state of the NHS. Welsh Labour are going to hold a ""short sharp"" analysis into what went wrong. Carwyn Jones was in line with most of the criticism of Ed Miliband when he told AMs that the party needed to appeal to small business owners who are not millionaires but who work hard. What will be more difficult is countering the argument on the NHS, which the former minister Alun Davies believes is already lost. Another potential difficulty for Welsh Labour will be dealing with unhappiness within the party over council re-organisation. Bernie Attridge, the deputy leader of Flintshire Council, has tweeted saying the party needs to be careful on local government reform if it wants to retain the support of grassroots councillors. It also seems to have been the case that Labour lost more votes to UKIP than the Conservatives, which is another challenge to overcome. But Labour will at least have the advantage that it will be David Cameron, and not Ed Miliband, carrying out the latest round of public sector cuts that are likely to take effect sooner rather than later. The question is whether Carwyn Jones is going to be able to turn that to his advantage when his own record in government will be under scrutiny. Plaid Cymru's education spokesman, Simon Thomas, also in the party's weekly press briefing, said he believed Leanne Wood could portray herself as an alternative first minister because of the way she emotionally connected with people in the campaign. The party now has a year to make that a credible proposition after it failed to gain any new seats and came fourth, behind UKIP, in the overall share of the vote, despite her unprecedented profile. He also said that on the campaign trail people wanted to know what Plaid was going to do about the NHS and that people ""did not see the strengths"" of its arguments.

The system would appoint a named person - usually a teacher or health visitor - to ensure the wellbeing of every child. But judges at the UK's highest court ruled against the scheme in July 2016, citing concerns over information sharing. The Supreme Court judges said some proposals breached rights to privacy and a family life under the European Convention on Human Rights. However, the court said the aim of the Act, which is intended to promote and safeguard the rights and wellbeing of children and young people, was legitimate. Speaking ahead of his statement to the Scottish Parliament, Mr Swinney said the Scottish government remained ""absolutely committed"" to the Named Person service as a way to support children and their families. ""Last year the Supreme Court ruled definitively that the intention of providing a Named Person for every child to promote and safeguard their wellbeing was 'unquestionably legitimate and benign',"" he said.

""Since the judgement, we have undertaken an intensive period of engagement with children, young people, parents, carers, practitioners and professionals. ""I will now update parliament on the next steps in this vital means of supporting, safeguarding and promoting the wellbeing of our children and young people."" The judges said in July that specific proposals about information-sharing were ""not within the legislative competence of the Scottish Parliament"".

A reading below 50 indicates falling output. It is the first time that activity in the sector has fallen since March 2013. Firms blamed soft domestic demand, a fall in new business from overseas and uncertainty ahead of the EU referendum. A slowdown in the oil and gas industry, a major customer for UK companies, is also hitting production. The index for new orders fell to 50.4 in April, from 51.9 the month before, matching February's three-year low. Rob Dobson, senior economist at Markit, said: ""On this evidence manufacturing production is now falling at a quarterly pace of around 1%, and will likely act as a drag on the economy again during the second quarter and putting greater pressure on the service sector to sustain GDP growth. ""The manufacturing labour market is also being impacted, with the data signalling close to 20,000 job losses over the past three months."" Last week, official figures showed UK economic growth slowed to 0.4% in the first quarter of the year from 0.6% in late 2015, propped up by the services sector. David Noble, group chief executive at the Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply (CIPS), said: ""Recent fears over a stall in the UK's manufacturing sector have now become a reality. ""An atmosphere of deep unease is building throughout the manufacturing supply chain, eating away at new orders, reducing British exports and putting more jobs at risk. ""A sense of apprehension across the sector is being caused by enduring volatility in the oil and gas industry, falling retailer confidence and the uncertainty created by the EU referendum."" The Markit/CIPS survey found new export orders contracted for the fourth straight month in April as the global economy continued to slow. A measure of employment in the manufacturing sector was also below the 50 mark for its fourth straight month. Lee Hopley, chief economist at the manufacturers' organisation, EEF, said: ""The sharp drop to a three-year low and another month of reported job cuts could be the clearest sign yet that referendum uncertainty is starting to weigh on the real economy.

The ruling preserves the law known as Obamacare, which Mr Obama considers a major part of his presidential legacy. Republicans have vowed to continue fighting the law. ""We've got more work to do, but what we're not going to do is unravel what has now been woven into the fabric of America,"" Mr Obama said. The case, known as King v Burwell, was the second major challenge the law has faced in the US's highest court. Unlike in many other western countries, the US does not have a single-payer healthcare system. Private companies, rather than the US government, provide health insurance for US citizens. The enactment of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) - one of Mr Obama's most significant and controversial domestic achievements - in 2010 mandated that every American had to purchase private insurance. It provided the subsidies to allow many to do so. In 2012, the mandate portion of the law was challenged in the court. The justices ruled to preserve it. In that decision, as in the decision on Thursday, Chief Justice John Roberts surprised observers by siding with his liberal colleagues in support of the law. ""Congress passed the Affordable Care act to improve health insurance markets, not to destroy them,"" Chief Justice John Roberts wrote in the opinion. Justice Anthony Kennedy dissented in 2012, but sided with the majority on Thursday. Had the court made the opposite decision, an estimated 8.7 million people in the US would have been at risk of losing the aid that makes healthcare affordable. The stakes could not have been higher. People's health (crucially important) and Obama's legacy (less important, but for him and those around him fairly vital) were at stake. Well a politically finely balanced Supreme Court has given an emphatic, overwhelming vote in favour of the president by 6-3. I bet ""No-drama Obama"" is high-fiving anyone and everyone in the White House - that is how big it is. Obama defies lame-duck expectations Demonstrators gathered outside the court as early on Thursday morning. Reading updates on their mobile phones, the crowd became jubilant when they learned mid-morning that the court had ruled in their favour. Some began dancing, while others chanted ""If you're covered and you know it clap your hands."" ""This is a big sigh of relief for millions across the country,"" said Ron Pollack of Families USA, a health-care advocacy organisation. ""The ACA is not just the law of the land, it will remain the law of the land"". ""Today is a good day for healthcare in America,"" said activist Benton Strong. ""I hope this is the end of the line."" Demonstrators opposing the subsidies did not have a large visible presence. Justice Antonin Scalia wrote in his dissent that the Supreme Court is setting a precedent of favouring some laws over others.

The Marine Conservation Society (MCS) described it as an ""embarrassing U-turn"" for the Welsh government, and has called for better protection of seas. Creating the zones would mean a ban on fishing and anchoring in some areas and had brought opposition. The Welsh Fishermen's Association said previously that existing conservation networks for Welsh waters are adequate. The Welsh government proposed the zones last year with the backing of the Countryside Council of Wales and the Marine Conservation Society. The minister for natural resources said the decision had been made after the thousands of responses to the consultation brought ""divergent and strongly held views"".

Since then, efforts have been continuing to rescue it from closure and save the jobs of its 11,000 staff. Last week, a surprise late bid led by retail veteran Greg Tufnell transformed the race to acquire the retailer. His team, said to be backed by Portuguese money, is the front-runner. But if a deal cannot be struck, the business may still have to be liquidated. The remaining bidders have faded into the background. Another consortium led by Matalan tycoon John Hargreaves and Turkish retail entrepreneur Cafer Mahiroglu has reportedly run into difficulties, while other suitors have apparently failed to impress with their proposals. Some of those involved in the different bids have impressive retailing histories. But then Sir Philip Green, who controlled BHS from 2000 to 2015, also had a brilliant track record. And he ended up selling the business for Â£1. So what are the chances of saving BHS from the liquidators? And just who are the people aiming to do it? In the public eye, Greg Tufnell is easily overshadowed by his more famous brother Phil, the former England cricketer. But that could change if his bid for BHS is successful, because he hopes to become the firm's next chairman. And as far as his credentials for the job are concerned, the 54-year-old executive certainly talks the talk. He describes himself as ""a highly experienced managing director with Mothercare and Arcadia, a blend of entrepreneur, strategist and hands-on operator with significant commercial business turnaround, acquisition and fund-raising experience"". His record shows that he was buying and merchandising director at Next from 1991 to 1994. He then spent three years as managing director of menswear retailer Burton, part of the Arcadia group, followed by another three years as managing director of Mothercare. He currently appears to occupy a portfolio of different jobs, including the chairmanships of leather accessories brand Zatchels and recruitment consultancy hga Group. Earlier this month, he registered a new firm, Richess Group, at Companies House. Its other directors are Nick de Scossa, a Swiss banker, and Lisbon-based entrepreneur Jose Maria Soares Bento. Until Mr Tufnell's bid turned up, many observers had assumed that BHS would be snapped up by Matalan founder Mr Hargreaves. But it appears that the cost of a deal may have proved too high. Sources say Mr Hargreaves was asked to improve his offer and balked. Like Sir Philip Green, 71-year-old John Hargreaves also enjoys the life of the super-rich. He has an estimated fortune of Â£1bn, according to the Sunday Times Rich List. But in stark contrast to the ebullient Sir Philip, Mr Hargreaves is described by industry insiders as quiet-spoken, someone who shuns the limelight. Mr Hargreaves is no longer directly involved in the business he founded. He sold his 69% stake in Matalan in 2000, then in 2006 took it private through Missouri Bidco, a company 53.5% owned by him and his family.

Wrockwardine Wood and Sutherland academies, also run by the Telford Co-operative Multi-Academy Trust, were put in special measures earlier this week. The trust has not commented. Ofsted criticised the trust's lack of support to the schools and said each was now considering an alternative sponsor. Inspectors said pupils' achievement at the Phoenix Academy had dropped since it became an academy in 2013 and their latest report rated it inadequate in all areas. A report in 2013, before it converted, rated the secondary school as ""requiring improvement"", while Lakeside was rated ""good"" in 2012 under its former name the Lord Silkin School. In the latest report, inspectors said the curriculum at Phoenix Academy was ""inadequate"", while ""weak teaching"" meant pupils were not sufficiently challenged and were often ""disengaged and disruptive"". There was particular criticism of standards in English and maths which the watchdog said were limiting pupils' achievements in other areas. Ofsted's report said governors, managers and teachers had developed a ""culture of low expectations"", while leaders had failed to act decisively to halt the decline in pupils' achievement. There was, however, some praise for the acting head teacher. Inspectors said he had introduced a number of improvement measures and some were ""beginning to have an impact"". A report on Lakeside School highlighted similar concerns, criticising teachers for not sufficiently challenging pupils and for having ""over generous"" predictions of their achievement. Inspectors said many pupils, whether high achievers or those with special educational needs, were ""not making the progress they should"" and achievements at GCSE were well below the national average. Governors were also criticised for not holding leaders to account, while the report said management had failed to effectively monitor either pupils or teachers. Inspectors, did however highlight new initiatives to improve literacy which they said were ""beginning to have a positive impact"".",1,5,4

It was sent to UKIP's national executive committee (NEC) before a row over racial slurs about a Labour MP, for which Ms Brown apologised. But UKIP chairman Paul Oakden said the letter did not follow proper process. A UKIP assembly group spokesman said the letter was written by a group with a ""long-standing grudge"" against the AM. The ruling NEC body discussed the issue at a meeting on Friday, where they also decided to allow a controversial anti-Islam campaigner to run for the UKIP leadership. Mr Oakden said: ""A member of the NEC had contacted the person that is putting this forward and said to them they need to follow the proper process of completing the necessary forms and submitting them to the NEC. ""Members simply emailing the NEC saying we want you to do this is not the correct disciplinary process for the party, by any stretch of the imagination. ""A member of the NEC has gone back and given advice on what they need to do.""

""Her lack of effort in pursuing the aims of the party both locally and nationally is of concern to members across the region."" Mr Owen added he believed members would stop supporting UKIP if Ms Brown remained in the role. However, a spokesman for the party's assembly group dismissed the letter as written by a ""tiny and insignificant group"". In February, Ms Brown denied an allegation she had smoked recreational drugs in a hotel room. Later that month, she said she had acted ""with propriety"" after it was revealed she had discussed how an advert for a job in her assembly office could be changed to help her brother get an interview for the post.

Some of the items found included an armour-piercing improvised rocket and two anti-personnel mines. The main line of police inquiry is the arms belonged to dissident republicans. Last week, Home Secretary Theresa May said MI5 believed an attack on targets in Great Britain by dissident republicans had become ""a strong possibility"". Analysis: Vincent Kearney, BBC News NI's home affairs correspondent The discovery of what appears to be a second dissident republican arms dump near Larne within three months has left police baffled. Based on location alone, the analysis would be that the items found most likely belonged to loyalist paramilitaries. But the nature of what was found suggests otherwise and the finger of suspicion firmly in the direction of dissident republicans. Det Supt Kevin Geddes said the threat level in Northern Ireland from dissident republican groups remains ""severe"" and an attack is ""highly likely"". Police officers found three barrels hidden in holes in the forest. As well as rockets and mines, there were also several pipe bombs, assault rifle ammunition and parts to construct a ""substantial number of explosive devices"". Det Supt Geddes said the seizure was significant ""both in terms of its size and its capability"". ""A number of these devices were ready to be deployed,"" he added. ""This seizure has undoubtedly saved lives."" He said the type of weapons that had been found meant police would focus their investigation on dissident republicans. In March, an arms find was made at Carnfunnock Country Park near Larne, and police said the were investigating a connection between the two discoveries.

State media picked up the story on Thursday, which was first reported in a local evening paper earlier this week. Liaoshen Wanbao reported the 49-year-old woman in Shenyang city had claimed her husband had divorced her 10 years ago because he disliked the shape of her face, said to be ""large and square"" with ""fat cheeks"". She said it spurred her to undergo facial surgery three times at a local hospital to shave her jawbones and reshape her face into a slimmer shape. During the third surgery the doctors discovered that if they proceeded further her nerves may be damaged, and halted the procedure. The woman, identified only by her surname Wang, later sued the hospital for 1.7 million yuan ($260,900; Â£183,900) in damages. She alleged the surgery had left her with soreness in her chin, and she could only eat and drink through a straw as ""when she exerted force on her lower jaw, she had the sensation that it would break"". The hospital, however, argued that the surgeries were conducted according to regulations, and pointed out that they encouraged her to seek psychiatric help instead of a third operation, which she refused. After mediation the woman agreed to accept 20,000 yuan ($3,100, Â£2,200) as compensation, said the report. On Weibo, some condemned the woman's husband, but others also chastised the woman. One top-voted comment read: ""It's purely an excuse, if her face was large then why did he decide to marry her in the first place? If he stopped loving her then he should have just said so."" It continued: ""This woman is also very silly to have believed that her face shape was the real reason for the divorce, she is lying to herself."" Said another Weibo user: ""Even if you had gone for facial surgery and made your face smaller, he would still have found other reasons to divorce you."" One person noted the sharp difference in the compensation amount and voiced suspicions: ""1.7 million was dropped to 20,000, it makes me wonder if she really did have a problem with her jaw."" Still others took the opportunity to crack jokes. ""What an odd reason for divorce! I wonder how square was this woman's square-shaped face? Like a television set? Microwave oven?"" Plastic surgery has long been a hot topic on Weibo. In December, users similarly expressed outrage when a Chinese man took out a newspaper advertisement pleading for his wife to go for plastic surgery.

A ""pre-action protocol letter"" from the council's legal department to Ms Teal warned the authority will seek a High Court injunction to stop her, and others involved in ""direct action"", from taking part in future protests.

Their intention in travelling to the region, where areas are controlled by Islamic State (IS) militants or an al-Qaeda affiliate, is not clear. The Foreign Office has said it is in contact with the Turkish authorities. The BBC's Mark Lowen said the information about the ages of the children had not been independently verified and it was too early to know where the group were intending to head to. ""Were they heading for one of the more moderate groups in Syria. Were they heading for the area controlled by al-Nusra, the al-Qaeda affiliate? Or were they heading to so-called Islamic State territory?"" he said. The group was taken to a police station in southern Turkey overnight, and then sent to the foreigners department awaiting deportation to the UK. They have undergone medical examinations and had their finger-prints taken. The United Nations estimates the number of foreign fighters joining militant groups is more than 25,000, from 100 different nations. About 600 Britons are believed to have gone to Syria or Iraq since IS seized control of large swathes of territory there. Most are thought to have volunteered as fighters for the militant Islamist group. Around half are believed to have later returned to the UK, the Metropolitan Police has said. The latest detentions come two weeks after three British teenagers were stopped from travelling into Syria from Turkey. The three - two aged 17 and one 19, from north-west London - were arrested following a tip-off from British police and flown back to the UK. They have since been released on police bail. They had flown to Turkey from Barcelona and were arrested at Sabiha Gokcen airport in Istanbul. Fadi Hakura, Turkey analyst for Chatham House, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the recent arrests showed the Turkish government was ""taking more effective measures to control the flow of fighters and supporters into Syria"". He said there was now ""more enhanced security and intelligence cooperation between Turkey and its Western counterparts, especially with the exchange of names that Turkey needs to prohibit [IS supporters] from crossing into Syria"". The Turkish government has said it cannot make a 560-mile border watertight and will act when it has prior warning. In February this year there were recriminations between British police and Turkish officials after three London schoolgirls disappeared from Turkey, apparently having crossed the border into Syria. Shamima Begum, Amira Abase, both 15, and Kadiza Sultana, 16 had flown to Istanbul and travelled to the border region.

He admitted culpable homicide on the basis of diminished responsibility after saying he had no recollection of the killing at Dixon Avenue, Glasgow, on 24 September last year. Buksh will be sentenced on 27 June. The High Court in Glasgow heard that 43-year-old Mrs Buksh died after being struck on the head at least five times. Pathologists told the court that the lack of defensive injuries and the position of her body suggested she was assaulted as she slept. Following the attack, Buksh went to Cathcart Police Station and told an officer: ""I've come to hand myself in. I think my wife's dead. I hit her on the head. I did it."" The court was told that three psychiatrists described Buksh as suffering from an acute stress disorder at the time. Prosecutor Gordon Lamont said: ""The accused and his wife had been married for 25 years, but over the last 10 or 11 years their relationship appears to have broken down and they became increasingly estranged, albeit, still residing under the one roof. ""They slept separately and Mrs Buksh routinely slept on the sofa in the living room. Their children report that they barely spoke to each other."" Mr Lamont said the problems in the marriage intensified after Mrs Buksh went to Pakistan on holiday in May last year. He said she had become involved with another man and was making plans to move to Pakistan. The court also heard that two days before he killed his wife, Buksh went to Paisley Police Office and spoke with a support officer saying he feared his wife was going to take their youngest child, aged 10, to Pakistan and not return. He also made an emergency doctor's appointment and said he was suffering from stress and not sleeping. He was prescribed medication for stress. Defence counsel Sarah Livingstone said: ""My client has no memory of this incident. His amnesia is absolutely genuine. ""This is not a case where this man was a bad husband, there was no domestic abuse. This was an unhappy marriage, but however, unhappy it was it didn't justify killing his wife.

I got it like other people on our network. The buzz around it was then created on different social media websites and with videos. I was here on 25 January when riot police forced us out and by the 28th, we were back following the violence. I've been sleeping here most of the time since. Our social network was established in 2005, when there was a democratic opening around the time of the presidential elections. People from different backgrounds all met through blogging and hoped to use technology for social change. It meant we have all gained good contacts, experience and strong networks. I like to think the social network is the people itself. Things like Facebook, Twitter, SMS and phones are just social tools. When they blocked Facebook and shut down technology, our network still operated because it's about people. Internet activists are also people and a lot of our organising, social work and relationships are developed offline. This is something that people dreamt of but didn't anticipate happening in reality. If anything, it shows that all the effort we put in over the past few years has not been wasted. It has climaxed into this critical mass of people you see in the square. At the moment I'm not getting a lot of internet connection. I'm trying not to drain my phone battery. We're still using it to distribute footage people are bringing to us that we've sorted through. I hope the internet will continue to play a complementary role in activism. At the moment we physically exist in downtown Cairo and I hope that when we have finished this sit-in, we will have won the right to organise ourselves outside the internet. Twitter: Amr Gharbeia I was involved in this revolution from the first day, 25 January, and I've now been spending my nights here for a while. For the past five years, I was very active online, blogging and tweeting. As we live under emergency laws in Egypt it has been very difficult to meet or communicate except on the internet. I'd never been part of a demonstration on the ground. At first we were mocking the event on 25 January. We questioned whether it was really possible to have a ""Facebook revolution"". I came on the 25th because I felt it was my duty as a citizen and I couldn't believe how it turned into something so different from what we've seen before. I was walking among the people and weeping. Now I sometimes just tweet to update people about what's going on or to call for a million-man demonstration or a day to remember our martyrs. I'm well-known among bloggers for my long articles and constant tweets, but once I was here I stopped communicating this way so much. I felt it was totally different to have real freedom rather than just hypothetical freedom or internet freedom. Blogging and tweeting has been important as we were building our minds.

The murder, filmed on CCTV and on mobile phones, sparked outrage. The Church of the Almighty God cult is banned in China but claims to have millions of members. Following the brutal killing in May, Chinese authorities said that they detained hundreds of members of the cult, reports the BBC's Martin Patience in Beijing. Interviewed in prison later, one of the defendants, Zhang Lidong showed no remorse. He said: ""I beat her with all my might and stamped on her too. She was a demon. We had to destroy her.""

""It was kind of frightening,"" he said. ""When we landed, all the people picking us up were going, 'we didn't expect you were going to fly in this weather'. ""But the pilot didn't say anything about that. We saw the lightning up there. I thought it was pyrotechnics for Arcade Fire."" The thunderstorm heralded a brief but torrential downpour, and the power cut took BBC coverage off the air. Music resumed on the main stage at 19:00 BST with Lily Allen, who dedicated an expletive-laden song to FIFA president Sepp Blatter. Other performers on Friday included Blondie, who proved so popular it became impossible to enter or leave The Other Stage at lunchtime, and Paolo Nutini, whose soulful ballads were a fitting soundtrack as dusk fell over Somerset. Sophie Ellis-Bextor sneaked some disco into her set at the largely-acoustic Avalon Stage, while the pulsing synthpop of Glaswegian band Chvrches made for a steamy atmosphere in the John Peel tent as fans danced off the downpour. Arcade Fire took to the stage shortly after 22:00 BST, their arrival heralded by a man dressed from head-to-toe in a mirrored suit. Bravely, considering the weather conditions, the 12-piece band were largely dressed in white, but if they were worried about laundry bills, it didn't show. They threw themselves around the stage, thrashing and spinning as though plagued by a swarm of invisible bees, each member switching instruments between - and often during - songs. As well as guitars, they played steel drums, xylophones and even a hurdy gurdy. Frontman Win Butler made frequent excursions into the audience and, during the song Flashbulb Eyes, plucked a camera from a press photographer and carried it on stage to capture the band's performance. The set list was evenly spread across their four albums, with highlights including No Cars Go, Neighborhood #1 (Tunnels) and Rebellion (Lies). The group's recurring subject matter of suburban despair and alienation might have seemed like an odd fit for Glastonbury's peace and love ethos, but there is an optimism and belief in humanity at the core of their music.

together_opt-175b,Archaeologists have discovered a Mesolithic Period shelter in Wiltshire that was used for 90 years.,"The shelter - in a hollow left behind by a fallen tree - at Blick Mead was used over a 90-year period from 4336 BC, it is believed. Archaeologist David Jacques, said: ""They... used the stump of the tree, about three metres high, as a wall."" The finds are being shown to United Nations heritage experts, who are currently visiting Stonehenge. Archaeologists are concerned a planned 2.9km tunnel being considered for the nearby A303 main road will damage the site. Discoveries have also shown stones were warmed up by the Mesolithic Period inhabitants and used in a hearth to emit heat in the earthy snug. Mr Jacques, a senior research fellow at the University of Buckingham, has worked at Blick Mead for over a decade, making a number of discoveries about the inhabitants. The tree stump created a wall height similar to a ""modern bungalow"". ""They've draped probably animal skins or thatch around the basin and connected it to a post so it's a very comfortable snug little place,"" he said. The wooden wall of the hollow was lined with flints and the large earthy pit created by the tree root lined with cobbles and decorated with ""exotic"" stones from outside the area. ""There are some clever and sophisticated things going on, the hot stones that they put into this little type of alcove wouldn't have been on fire,"" explained Mr Jacques. ""It looks more like these people have been using these hot stones as a type of storage heater so that you've got a lot of warmth coming off them."" Mr Jacques will meet the UN experts later to ask for the route to be moved closer to Salisbury and for hydrological assessments to be made. ""It's very likely the water flow would be reduced in and around the site,"" he said. ""It would take out all the organics and destroy all the animal bone we've been finding which is crucial for finding where they have been living and for getting radiocarbon dates from all the organics like pollen and wood. ""This is massively important for reconstructing what the landscape would have looked like."" Andy Rhind-Tutt, former mayor and chairman of Amesbury Museum and Heritage Trust said: ""I sincerely hope the team delivering the long-awaited A303 improvement look seriously at an alternative alignment south of Salisbury and away from this unequalled archaeological landscape. ""It would be criminal to destroy such a rich heritage and connection with our ancestors for the sake of blocking the view to the passing public of Stonehenge.""",1,5,4
together_opt-175b,Archaeologists have discovered evidence of a Mesolithic settlement near Stonehenge.,"David Jacques, from the University of Buckingham, made the discovery at Blick Mead in October, and said the carbon dating results had just been confirmed. But he also raised concerns about possible damage to the site over plans to build a road tunnel past Stonehenge. The Department of Transport said it would ""consult before any building"". The Blick Mead site is about 1.5 miles (2.4km) from Stonehenge and archaeologists said ""scientifically tested charcoal"" dug up from the site had ""revealed that it dated from around 4000 BC"". David Jacques said the dig had also found ""evidence of feasting"" including burnt flints, tools and remains of giant cattle, known as aurochs, which were eaten by early hunter gatherers. Mr Jacques said: ""British pre-history may have to be rewritten. This is the latest dated Mesolithic encampment ever found in the UK. ""Blick Mead site connects the early hunter gatherer groups returning to Britain after the Ice Age to the Stonehenge area, all the way through to the Neolithic in the late 5th Millennium BC. ""But our only chance to find out about the earliest chapter of Britain's history could be wrecked if the tunnel goes ahead."" Andy Rhind-Tutt, a former mayor and current chairman of Amesbury Museum, which part-funded the dig, said the discovery could ""provide what archaeologists have been searching for centuries - the answer to the story of the pre-history of Stonehenge."" Earlier this month, the government announced funding for a 1.8-mile (2.9km) tunnel to remove congestion from the main road past Stonehenge. A Department for Transport spokesman said: ""As with any road scheme, we will consult with interested parties before any building begins on the A303. ""English Heritage and National Trust are supportive of our plans, and we will ensure sites of cultural or historical significance are safeguarded as we progress with the upgrade.""",1,5,4

together_opt-175b,"BHS could be saved from closure and 11,000 jobs saved if a rescue bid led by retail veteran Greg Tufnell is successful.","BHS entered administration in April. Since then, efforts have been continuing to rescue it from closure and save the jobs of its 11,000 staff. Last week, a surprise late bid led by retail veteran Greg Tufnell transformed the race to acquire the retailer. His team, said to be backed by Portuguese money, is the front-runner. But if a deal cannot be struck, the business may still have to be liquidated. The remaining bidders have faded into the background. Another consortium led by Matalan tycoon John Hargreaves and Turkish retail entrepreneur Cafer Mahiroglu has reportedly run into difficulties, while other suitors have apparently failed to impress with their proposals. Some of those involved in the different bids have impressive retailing histories. But then Sir Philip Green, who controlled BHS from 2000 to 2015, also had a brilliant track record. And he ended up selling the business for Â£1. So what are the chances of saving BHS from the liquidators? And just who are the people aiming to do it? In the public eye, Greg Tufnell is easily overshadowed by his more famous brother Phil, the former England cricketer. But that could change if his bid for BHS is successful, because he hopes to become the firm's next chairman. And as far as his credentials for the job are concerned, the 54-year-old executive certainly talks the talk. He describes himself as ""a highly experienced managing director with Mothercare and Arcadia, a blend of entrepreneur, strategist and hands-on operator with significant commercial business turnaround, acquisition and fund-raising experience"". His record shows that he was buying and merchandising director at Next from 1991 to 1994. He then spent three years as managing director of menswear retailer Burton, part of the Arcadia group, followed by another three years as managing director of Mothercare. He currently appears to occupy a portfolio of different jobs, including the chairmanships of leather accessories brand Zatchels and recruitment consultancy hga Group. Earlier this month, he registered a new firm, Richess Group, at Companies House. Its other directors are Nick de Scossa, a Swiss banker, and Lisbon-based entrepreneur Jose Maria Soares Bento. Until Mr Tufnell's bid turned up, many observers had assumed that BHS would be snapped up by Matalan founder Mr Hargreaves. But it appears that the cost of a deal may have proved too high. Sources say Mr Hargreaves was asked to improve his offer and balked. Like Sir Philip Green, 71-year-old John Hargreaves also enjoys the life of the super-rich. He has an estimated fortune of Â£1bn, according to the Sunday Times Rich List. But in stark contrast to the ebullient Sir Philip, Mr Hargreaves is described by industry insiders as quiet-spoken, someone who shuns the limelight. Mr Hargreaves is no longer directly involved in the business he founded. He sold his 69% stake in Matalan in 2000, then in 2006 took it private through Missouri Bidco, a company 53.5% owned by him and his family. As a partner in Mr Hargreaves' bid, there is also Cafer Mahiroglu, the owner of Select Fashions. At 50, he is the youngest of",1,5,5

The city was rocked by riots in April when a black man died after suffering injuries in police custody. Six officers were charged over the death of the 25-year-old, Freddie Gray. Speaking at a news conference on Wednesday, Mayor Rawlings-Blake said Mr Batts had ""served this city with distinction"" since becoming police chief in October 2012. But referring to the city's high homicide rate, she said ""too many continue to die"". ""The focus has been too much on the leadership of the department and not enough on the crime fighting,"" she told reporters, adding: ""We need to get the crime surge under control."" The city has seen a sharp increase in violence since Freddie Gray's death on 19 April, with 155 homicides this year, a 48% increase over the same period last year. On Tuesday, the police department announced that an outside organisation will review its response to the civil unrest that followed Mr Gray's death. The US justice department is also conducting a civil rights review of the Baltimore force and Mr Batts has been criticised by the city's police union. Earlier on Wednesday, the union released its report into the police handling of the rioting. It said officers had complained ""that they lacked basic riot equipment, training, and, as events unfolded, direction from leadership"". The report also said ""officers repeatedly expressed concern that the passive response to the civil unrest had allowed the disorder to grow into full scale rioting"". Recent events had ""placed attention on police leadership"", Ms Rawlings-Blake said, but denied her decision was influenced by the union report. Mr Davis, who is taking over immediately as interim police chief, praised his ""friend"" Mr Batts and said he was a ""true reform commissioner"". Mayor Rawlings-Blake said Mr Davis would ""bring accountability to police, hold officers who act out of line accountable for their actions"".",1,4,5

His intervention in the debate - made, as he termed it, with ""deafening eclat"" - was even said to have helped cause the pound to slide on the international money markets as traders thought it made the possibility of a so-called Brexit more likely. He has arguably the highest profile of any of the governing Conservative Party except the Prime Minister David Cameron, but those outside the UK may be wondering: who is he, and is that actually his hair? Read on. Profile: Boris Johnson How could 'zip wire prat' become prime minister? Read more about the UK's referendum on the EU Alexander Boris de Pfeffel Johnson, to give him his full name, was born in New York and is descended from Turkish, French and German stock. He describes himself as a ""one-man melting pot"". He first made a name for himself in journalism, including a stint as Brussels correspondent for the right-wing Daily Telegraph newspaper and editor of The Spectator magazine. His humorous persona led him to become a fixture on various television programmes, including the satirical BBC panel show Have I Got News For You. He still has a lucrative and entertaining column in the Daily Telegraph, in which august forum he explained the reasons for his decision on the EU. As a politician, he has been a Conservative member of parliament for two constituencies, Henley from 2001 to 2008 and then Uxbridge and South Ruislip from 2015. Lest you think he was putting his feet up between parliamentary mandates, he is also currently serving the second of two terms as mayor of London, no mean feat in a city where the centre-left Labour Party has dominated in recent decades. That's indicative of the position Mr Johnson has carved out for himself as one of the most charismatic politicians in the UK who has wide appeal beyond Conservative heartlands - polling has suggested that his stance on the EU referendum may sway some undecided voters. Just look what happens when you type his name into Google.co.uk. Not quite. He has previously courted controversy for his remarks about (among others) the populations of Liverpool, Portsmouth and Papua New Guinea, not to mention run-ins with his own party leadership and TV chef Jamie Oliver. Last October he accidentally flattened a 10-year-old schoolboy at what was meant to be a friendly game of photo-op rugby in Japan. But none of this seems to have affected his standing among the party faithful or the public at large. Even getting stuck on a zip-wire during the London Olympics in 2012, a sure-fire route to derision for any other politician, only enhanced his eccentric image.

together_opt-175b,Campaigners have called for the EU to stop negotiations on a trade deal with the US because they fear it will undermine European standards.,"The petition calls on the EU and its member states to stop the talks on the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership or TTIP. It also says they should not ratify a similar deal that has already been done between the EU and Canada. It says some aspects pose a threat to democracy and the rule of law. One of the concerns mentioned in the petition is the idea of tribunals that foreign investors would be able to use in some circumstances to sue governments. There is a great deal of controversy over exactly what this system, known as Investor State Dispute Settlement, would enable companies to do, but campaigners see it as an opportunity for international business to get compensation for government policy changes that adversely affect them. This kind of provision exists in many bilateral trade and investment agreements. Friends of the Earth have published new research on the impact they have had on EU countries. Information about these cases is not always made public, but the group says that going back to 1994, foreign investors have sought compensation of almost €30bn (£24bn) from 20 states. Where the results are known (a small minority of the total), the tribunals have awarded total compensation of €3.5bn (about £2.8bn). In Britain, the possible implications of this provision for the National Health Service have been especially controversial. Campaigners believe that the investor tribunals would make it harder to reverse any decisions to contract services out to international healthcare firms. John Hilary of War on Want said: TTIP ""will make it impossible for any future government to repeal the Health & Social Care Act and bring the NHS back into public hands"". The petition lists a number of other areas where its signatories believes European standards would suffer if the TTIP negotiations are completed and the Canada deal is ratified: employment, social, environmental, privacy and consumer protection. The European Commission says the EU will not have to sacrifice its high standards. It also says investor protection provisions are important for investment flows and have in general worked well. But it accepts there is a need for improvement and is trying to achieve that in its bilateral negotiations. The petition has been organised as an exercise called a European Citizens' Initiative which can lead to a public hearing in the European Parliament and require the European Commission to give a formal response explaining why it is accepting or rejecting what the petitioners call for. The European Commission has already said that the petition doesn't qualify as such an Initiative. Campaigners have launched a legal challenge to this decision.",1,5,5

Freezing care provider fees to save money was no long sustainable, it said. Ministers say extra money will help NHS and social care services work together. The survey, which was completed by 147 directors of adult social services for councils in England, suggests that funding reductions to social care budgets have totalled £4.6bn since 2010 - a 31% overall reduction. Budgets for adult social care - which provides practical support to people due to illness, disability, old age or a low income - will reduce by a further £500m in cash terms this year, it said. ""Taking the growth in numbers of older and disabled people into account, this means that an additional £1.1bn would be needed to provide the same level of service as last year,"" the report warned. It said some councils had made savings in the past by freezing fees paid to providers, but care providers were now also facing financial problems. Some companies - particularly those in southern England - are struggling to attract staff, amid increasing concern about the quality of care, it said. ""What is at stake is the continuing capacity of adult social care to sustain services to those in greatest need,"" ADASS president Ray James said. ""In virtually all our authorities, the number in need is growing, while the complexity of their needs is increasing."" ADASS called for the government to ""protect essential care and support services to the most vulnerable members of our community"". But a government spokesman said the survey ""ignores"" a commitment to invest £10bn in health services that are being ""joined up"" with social care, by 2020. The BBC has launched an online guide to the care system for the over-65s. The ""care calculator"" covers residential care and the support provided in people's own homes, for tasks such as washing and dressing. Users can submit their postcode and find out how much each service costs where they live in the UK. There is also a dedicated BBC Cost of Care website, with news stories, analysis and video. The spokesman said: ""Increasing budgets isn't the only solution. By working innovatively and joining up health and social care we can improve care and also save money."" However, Councillor Izzi Seccombe, from the Local Government Association (LGA), said adult social care services were facing ""enormous pressures"" due to ""insufficient funding, growing demand and escalating costs"". ""We have long warned that investing in the NHS whilst social care budgets are under continual pressure is simply a false economy. ""It is social care services that support elderly and vulnerable people to maintain their independence, live in their own community and stay out of hospital longer,"" she added.

Needing 99 to win, England sent out Jos Buttler and Ben Stokes in the top four. But they were eventually beaten by the fading light, finishing 25 runs short of a famous victory on 74-4. The tourists could not find the boundary frequently enough before the umpires brought the teams off, with Joe Root 33 not out. However, this was a hugely impressive performance from England and one that will fill them with confidence ahead of the second Test in Dubai, which begins on Thursday. After England concluded their innings on 598-9 in the morning, Pakistan looked assured at 113-3 shortly after tea, leading by 38 with seven second-innings wickets remaining. But the match turned when veteran batsman Younus Khan, playing in his 102nd Test match, mistimed a wild heave to give Rashid his first Test wicket - caught at point by Stokes. Rashid - whose figures in the first innings were the worst ever by a debutant - then quickly added a second victim, having Asad Shafiq caught behind for six. The door was opened for England, and Rashid and Moeen Ali barged through it as they polished off the last five wickets for 14 runs. Pakistan skipper Misbah ul-Haq - who had played with restraint for his 51 - inexplicably aimed an uncharacteristic slog at Moeen and was bowled. Moeen then removed Wahab Riaz caught behind, before Rashid claimed the final three wickets - all superbly caught at first slip by James Anderson. England sensed an unlikely victory, but their reorganised batting order could not score quickly enough as Pakistan's tactic of spin from both ends and fielders on the boundary brought them regular wickets. Makeshift opener Buttler was trapped lbw for four, Moeen and Stokes were caught on the boundary in quick succession, and Jonny Bairstow was stumped attempting a big shot. However, in truth it was mistakes earlier in the match that ultimately proved more costly as England fell just short of their first win on the subcontinent since beating India in Kolkata in 2012. In Pakistan's first innings, Ian Bell dropped Mohammad Hafeez (98) and Shafiq (107) at slip early in their innings. And Shoaib Malik, who made 245, was dismissed off a no-ball by Stuart Broad. England captain Alastair Cook, whose record-breaking 263 in the first innings was ultimately in vain, admitted England were frustrated to come so close to victory.

Pulse said that one scheme had already been looked at by the General Medical Council, the body which regulates medical standards in the UK, after local GP leaders expressed their concern. The magazine pointed out that initial hospital referrals for cancer patients should happen within two weeks of a GP first suspecting the condition. Dr Chand Nagpaul, chairman of the GPs committee of the doctors' trade union the British Medical Association, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that such schemes were a ""financial contaminant"" to patient-doctor trust. He said: ""It's short-sighted and misguided of CCGs to introduce such mechanisms, because they do lead to the potential for patients questioning the motives of GP referrals. ""We believe it is far more appropriate for CCGs to introduce clinical pathways that ensure patients are referred appropriately rather than these crude, salesman-like bonuses which pay GPs simply to make reduction to referrals in numerical terms."" Dr Peter Melton is local GP and clinical chief officer for North East Lincolnshire CCG, which offers the equivalent of more than Â£6,000 to practices that reduce outpatient referrals to the same level as the 25% with the lowest referral rates (which include two-week urgent cancer referrals) in 2014/15. He said the CCG was already among the best in England for referring suspected cancer patients to a consultant within two weeks and the scheme was not about avoiding sending people to hospital. ""It is not focussing on referral reduction per se but on better clinical and quality standards for the patient,"" he explained. ""The expectation is practices will be encouraged to investigate more locally and monitor the patient in the first instance rather than automatically refer in to a secondary care service."" Analysis by the BBC's Helen Briggs The NHS is under pressure to make savings, with a target of carving out Â£22bn of efficiency savings by 2020.

The apes began to disappear from the documents about 150 years ago, corresponding with population growth. The study is published in the Proceedings of the Royal Society B. Hainan gibbons are now limited to a few isolated patches of forest in the south west of China. They live in just four social groups, one of which was only discovered a few weeks ago. Understanding this population crash has been difficult, but the old government documents have helped to reveal when and how the numbers fell. Dr Sam Turvey, from the Zoological Society of London, said: ""China is one of the few places in the world that has a very very rich, long historical record. ""Because it has had such a complex bureaucracy for so long, there has been a lot of need for reporting - not just numbers of households for tax purposes and things like that, but also in terms of the kinds of natural resources that were available in the immediate environment."" These included records of animals, including gibbons, he said. ""We looked at the pattern of disappearance of gibbons through time and how that varied from place to place and the different environmental conditions and human pressures that were also present in these places."" The archives show that gibbons were a common sight in about 20 provinces in China well into the 17th and 18th Century. However, Dr Turvey said it was ""a stark contrast to their very imperilled position today"". ""We see a really steep increase in population decline and real population collapse across China about 100-150 years ago,"" he added. ""And this correlates with demographic expansion in China towards the end of the Imperial era and through the 20th Century, and the massive increase in deforestation and human population growth through the time of the Chinese Republic and the establishment of the communist party."" The researchers said a better understanding of the animals' decline would help them to establish a conservation plan for the country's last few Hainan gibbons. Dr Turvey said: ""It is an incredible privilege to be able to see gibbons in China in the wild. ""The Hainan gibbon is such as rare species, but knowing that this species is still hanging on there gives you hope that conservation will be able to bring that population back from the brink.""

together_opt-175b,Harper Lee has never explained why she stopped writing after To Kill a Mockingbird.,"Harper Lee's classic was published 50 years ago this summer and it remains the only novel she ever wrote. Lee, 84, has never explained why she stopped writing. She doesn't give interviews - ""Hell, no"" was her response to a request several decades ago - and that silence has only added to the intrigue. But her close friend Thomas Lane Butts, a retired minister in her hometown, Monroeville, Alabama, says she once told him the reason. Sitting on a pew in the Methodist church which the Lee family still attends, he described to me how she suddenly brought the subject up one night over dinner in New York. ""She asked me, 'You ever wonder why I didn't write anything else?' And I said, 'Along with several million other people, yes, I had wondered about that.' And she said, 'Well, what do you think?'"" Speaking in his slow southern drawl, the Rev Butts, who just turned 80, suggested to her that she had already written a great book and therefore didn't need to compete with herself. ""And when I got through she said, 'You're all wrong.' I said, 'Alright, smart Alec. You tell me.' She said, 'I would not go through all the deprivation of privacy through which I went for this book again for any amount of money.' ""And she said, 'I did not need to write another book. I said what I wanted to say in that book.'"" Harper Lee called it a simple tale about the ""conflict of the human soul"" and Monroeville, Alabama, is where she drew her inspiration. The story depicts the segregated South of her childhood, during the Depression. It was published at the height of the civil rights struggle. The Rev Butts grew up 10 miles outside Monroeville. By the late 1950s, he says, he was a ""fuzzy-cheeked young preacher"" campaigning for an end to segregation. He had met Martin Luther King Jr and signed a petition to boycott buses. The Ku Klux Klan had left a burning cross on his front lawn. He says To Kill a Mockingbird was not well received in Monroeville when it was published. ""The people who were hard racist did not like it because of the implication of the book,"" the Rev Butts told me. ""The book revealed racism and that always frightens a racist - when you pull the cover off them. ""Those of us who stood up for civil rights were much encouraged by the book because in a very skilful and subtle way it addressed itself for justice."" But these days, the Rev Butts says, there is enormous civic pride in Monroeville. The old courthouse, which Hollywood re-created for the film, now houses a museum to Harper Lee and the town's other literary icon, Truman Capote. Capote was a childhood friend of hers and is thought to be the inspiration for the Dill character in To Kill a Mockingbird. The town's residents often try to protect Lee, allowing her to live a normal life instead of being hounded by fans or bothered with prying questions. ""Being famous",1,5,3

That is down from 6.1% in the previous quarter. Analysts were expecting the same figure for January to March. India is the third-largest economy in Asia but has been struggling with inflation and currency weakness. Since July last year, the Indian rupee has seen one of the biggest declines among Asian currencies, dropping more than 27% against the US dollar. ""Shocking numbers as growth was even lower than lows witnessed during the financial crisis,"" said Anubhuti Sahay from Standard Chartered Bank in Mumbai. The BBC's Yogita Limaye in Mumbai said that just a year ago India was aspiring for double-digit growth. But a global slowdown has reduced external demand, and high inflation coupled with a weak rupee has made things more expensive within the country. Domestic demand, which India's economy is largely reliant on, has also slowed in part due to the political upheaval in the country. India's economy is suffering from ""policy incoherence, shifting global risk appetite and a comatose government"", said Rajeev Malik, senior economist at brokerage CLSA India's Prime Minister Manmohan Singh admitted early this month that his government must do more to get the once fast-growing economy moving again. The Congress-led coalition government is caught up in a slew of corruption scandals. Key policy reforms, including allowing foreign investment in India's retail sector, have been delayed in parliament for more than a year. This has worried foreign investors and threatened the country's investment grade credit rating.

Wrockwardine Wood and Sutherland academies, also run by the Telford Co-operative Multi-Academy Trust, were put in special measures earlier this week. The trust has not commented. Ofsted criticised the trust's lack of support to the schools and said each was now considering an alternative sponsor. Inspectors said pupils' achievement at the Phoenix Academy had dropped since it became an academy in 2013 and their latest report rated it inadequate in all areas. A report in 2013, before it converted, rated the secondary school as ""requiring improvement"", while Lakeside was rated ""good"" in 2012 under its former name the Lord Silkin School. In the latest report, inspectors said the curriculum at Phoenix Academy was ""inadequate"", while ""weak teaching"" meant pupils were not sufficiently challenged and were often ""disengaged and disruptive"". There was particular criticism of standards in English and maths which the watchdog said were limiting pupils' achievements in other areas. Ofsted's report said governors, managers and teachers had developed a ""culture of low expectations"", while leaders had failed to act decisively to halt the decline in pupils' achievement. There was, however, some praise for the acting head teacher. Inspectors said he had introduced a number of improvement measures and some were ""beginning to have an impact"". A report on Lakeside School highlighted similar concerns, criticising teachers for not sufficiently challenging pupils and for having ""over generous"" predictions of their achievement. Inspectors said many pupils, whether high achievers or those with special educational needs, were ""not making the progress they should"" and achievements at GCSE were well below the national average. Governors were also criticised for not holding leaders to account, while the report said management had failed to effectively monitor either pupils or teachers.

Election officials have urged patience. Uhuru Kenyatta, who faces trial at the International Criminal Court, has been leading in early presidential results declared from Monday's tightly contested election. He is due to stand trial at The Hague next month for allegedly fuelling violence after the disputed 2007 election. He denies the charge. His closest rival is outgoing Prime Minister Raila Odinga. With provisional results in from more than 40% of polling stations earlier on Wednesday, Mr Odinga had 42% of the vote compared with Mr Kenyatta's 53%. However, Mr Odinga's allies remain confident that he will gain ground as results from his strongholds, including the Coast Province, are declared. More than 1,000 people were killed in the violence which broke out in 2007-08 after Mr Odinga claimed he had been cheated of victory by supporters of President Mwai Kibaki, who is stepping down after two terms in office. The BBC's Solomon Mugera in the capital, Nairobi, says Kenyans are becoming increasingly anxious about the delay in finalising the results. Some businesses and schools across the country have remained shut since Monday's election, he says. This has led to a shortage of goods, pushing up the prices of basic foodstuff in areas such as Kibera, the biggest slum in Nairobi and a stronghold of Mr Odinga, our correspondent adds.

Its website had stopped giving updated results from the presidential race on Wednesday, and was still showing figures from Tuesday night. Our correspondent says the large number of spoiled ballots - about 6% of the total vote, well over double the number of votes cast for the third-placed candidate, Musailia Mudavadi - has become a major bone of contention.

She has a high standard to live up to - notably Prince's show in 2007, which took place in the middle of a Miami thunderstorm and is widely accepted as the greatest performance in the event's history, if not Prince's career. Here are some of the other most memorable - and surprising - moments from the last 30 years. Super Bowl performers get a very strict 12-minute time limit, so most performers cram their set with as much music as possible. Not Michael Jackson. After shooting onto the stage at the Pasadena Rose Bowl, he stood completely still, staring at the world for a full 90 seconds. Ninety. It was a master class in ratcheting expectation to a fever pitch. And the screams when he launched into Jam (not one of his best songs) proved he knew what he was doing. Brilliantly, Jackson staged this entire performance while wearing a jacket it looked like he'd borrowed from Muammar Gaddafi. Beat that, Gaga. Baby, he was born to run... and slide on his knees... and crotch slam a TV camera. In his autobiography, The Boss explains the incident like this: ""Too much adrenalin, a late drop, too much speed, here I come, Mikeâ€¦ BOOM!

The building has regenerated the area around Melton Mowbray's railway station, once a muddy pot-holed piece of wasteland where those in the know parked for free. Now the council offices link the station to a park and the town centre. It was partly paid for with insurance money after a fire destroyed the old offices on the other side of town. A supermarket moved in to replace it and helped with the money too, putting the council on a firm financial footing. But that was four years ago and the crisis is a different one today. It's being experienced by all local authorities - cuts in central government funding which threaten the services they provide. Mr Rhodes is also deputy leader of Leicestershire County Council, with responsibility for finance. Leicestershire is historically the poorest funded council in the country because of a quirk of Whitehall recalculations, going back a quarter of a century since the poll tax, or community charge, was scrapped. At the moment councils get income from council tax, a share of the business rates, any income they generate themselves from services plus a grant from central government. It's the grant cut which is causing them grief. What's called the ""core funding"" is worked out by the number of homes multiplied by a set amount. And each authority has a different value set per dwelling. If we look at Surrey, which is top of the table, the amount will be £1,686 by 2019/20. Nottinghamshire is mid-table at £1,482, Derbyshire is in the lower reaches with £1,422 per dwelling and then comes Leicestershire at £1,354. ""The funding system is chaotic,"" says Byron Rhodes. ""It doesn't reflect real need. Look at Oxfordshire which is an interesting example,"" he says with a glint in his eye. Could he possibly be referring to the prime ministerial plea to the county council about cutbacks to services there? ""If we had the same funding as Oxfordshire, we'd have £50m a year extra. If we had the same as Surrey, we'd have £100m more. We'd be partying everyday if we had that kind of money."" Leicestershire have been helped with a small share of what's been called transitional funding - about £300m to help councils following pressure from Conservative MPs. Think back to the vote on Sunday trading. With a majority of only 17 in the Commons, the Conservatives lost the vote when 20 odd rebelled. Last month there would've been another rebellion, including some of our own Tory MPs in the East Midlands, if something wasn't done to improve the local government finance settlement over the next four years. The money has gone largely to shire counties. Leicestershire got £6.6m spread over two years, enough to save some services from closure.

He founded Maine Mead Works in 2008, pouring his savings and money from friends and family into the business. His business has since grown, along with the popularity of mead in the US. It's now a seven-person operation that manufactures more than 7,500 cases a year, shipping them as far away as China. Mr Alexander is not the only one to have caught on to the commercial potential of mead. Vicky Rowe, the owner of mead information website GotMead, says interest in the product in the US has exploded in the past decade. ""We went from 30-40 meaderies making mead to somewhere in the vicinity of 250 in the last 10 years,"" she says. ""I like to say that everything old is new again - people come back to what was good once."" Even visitors to Mr Alexander's meadery agree. Tour participant Dirk Heseman admitted that while Maine Mead Works was the first meadery he'd actually visited, he has noticed that mead ""is becoming more and more available - similar to cider"". Just this year, commercial meaderies in the US have banded together to form an industry group, the American Mead Makers Association, to better share information and encourage growth in the industry. But there's a lot of work that needs to be done to improve the image of a drink long associated with Renaissance fairs and medieval re-enactments. ""I think our number one challenge as an industry is awareness of what mead is,"" says Mr Alexander. ""You ask 10 people in a room if they've ever heard of mead, and two of them might say, 'yes', and only one of them has had a very positive experience."" The mead of the past was often sweet, and didn't appeal to many drinkers",1,5,4

The group has warned that 750 more foster carers are ""urgently"" needed to meet the demands of the care system. It urged people to ""open their hearts and homes"" to vulnerable youngsters. Currently, more than 5,500 children are in foster care in Scotland, living with 4,400 families and carers. The Fostering Network surveyed 250 children, teenagers and foster carers across Scotland and discovered that many young people had failed to find stability. Almost half were already living with their third family, a quarter were with their fourth family and about 20 were living with their 10th family since going into care. There was a particular need for homes to be found for vulnerable teenagers, siblings and disabled children, the study found. Carla, 23, was taken into care at the age of 12 and had eight foster homes before moving in with the Randalls. ""Looking back now I realised that the Randalls saved my life,"" she said. ""I never understood the extent of the neglect and abuse I had endured until I came to live with a 'normal' loving family. ""They were just always themselves, the smallest details meant so much to me. ""They nurtured a young, angry, untrusting teenager to become a positive, empathetic and successful young woman."" The Fostering Network said instability had a detrimental effect on the child's education and wellbeing, while finding a stable foster carer from the outset could lead to improved relationships and a happier childhood. Sara Lurie, director of the Fostering Network Scotland, said: ""As each year passes, we see more and more children coming into care. ""We need people who can open their heart, and their homes, to vulnerable children and young people and use their skills to help support them to reach their full potential. ""In particular we need people who have the skills, patience and passion to look after teenagers who may have had a really tough time and be facing some real challenges, and to offer them love, stability and security. ""A good foster carer will believe in the ambition of the children in their care in the same way they'd believe in the ambition of their biological family members."" Apologies for the delay, see below as requested. A Scottish government spokeswoman said: ""Giving young people security is paramount and we have done a great deal of work with our partners across local government and the third sector to improve how we intervene early when there is a problem within families to find appropriate solutions quickly.

Morocco controls two-thirds of Western Sahara and sees it as part of its historic territory. However some, including the UN, see Western Sahara as Africa's last colony. Africa Live: More on this and other stories Find out more about Western Sahara A referendum was promised in 1991 but never carried out due to wrangling over who was eligible to vote. Thousands of Sahrawi refugees still live in refugee camps in Algeria - some have been there for 40 years. It is not clear what happens next but Western Sahara is hopeful that a committee set up by the AU will address the issues that both sides have raised. Some AU delegates said that it would be easier to resolve the issue with Morocco inside the AU. Sidi Mohammed, a Western Sahara official, told the BBC that Morocco's return to the AU means that it would now be expected to put ""in practice decisions taken by the AU with regard to a referendum in Western Sahara"". Mr Mohammed dismissed the suggestion that Morocco would now seek to get the AU to change its position, saying that the no country could unilaterally change the AU fundamental agreement, saying it opposed colonisation. In his speech at the AU summit, King Mohammed VI of Morocco said the readmission was not meant to divide the continental body. No. Algeria has always been a big supporter of Western Sahara's Polisario Front and it had wanted Morocco to accept independence of the territory as a condition for readmission. Zimbabwe and South Africa were also supportive of this stance but they were outnumbered by those who wanted Morocco back in the fold. There is no specific provision in the AU charter that bars any country from joining it. Morocco simply applied and the request was accepted by more than two-thirds of the 53 members. Morocco has been involved in intense lobbying and applied in July last year to rejoin the continental body. King Mohammed toured various African countries seeking support for the bid. No. While culturally the country's identity aligns with Arab states, its economic interests increasingly lie in Africa. This is a strategic move to continue exploring its interests in mining, construction, medical, insurance and banking sectors on the continent.

together_opt-175b,"Neil Lennon has been appointed manager of Hibernian, the club he previously led to three Scottish titles.","His previous jobs were at Celtic and Bolton, but moving to the second tier of Scottish football was no hindrance to him returning to work at Easter Road. Lennon saw the vacancy as an opportunity, and that was enough to encourage Hibs that a figure of his profile and experience would accept a role in the Championship. Even though his last job in Scotland involved leading a team on Champions League duty, Lennon's mind has not been swayed by haughtiness. The appointment of the former Celtic manager as successor to Alan Stubbs suits both parties, because it is mutually beneficial. Success is alluring, and Hibs offer Lennon the chance to accumulate more achievements. He was immediately engaged in crisis management at his previous club Bolton, but will find stability, potential and accomplishment at Easter Road. The demand will be to deliver promotion, but that will not seem daunting when the majority of the squad that pushed Rangers for a while last season then won the Scottish Cup is still in place. Lennon's task is to refine and bolster the team, when new managers are often faced with a period of overhaul. Stubbs left the club on an emotional high after delivering their first Scottish Cup in 114 years, but before the final against Rangers there was a tangible sense of exasperation that promotion had been missed. Hibs were entitled to feel that it was an unnecessary failure given their circumstances. The club is about to embark on a third season in the Championship, but by most other measures they can be considered a top-flight outfit. The budget will be significantly more than the rest of the teams in the division, the training ground at East Mains and facilities are first-class, the football side of the business is stable and well-run by George Craig, the club's head of football operations, the squad is full of talent. Lennon can rely on consistently assured performances from the likes of David Gray, Darren McGregor, Paul Hanlon, Lewis Stevenson, John McGinn, Fraser Fyvie, Dylan McGeouch, James Keatings and Jason Cummings. Some minor issues remain, such as who will fill the goal next season, but the challenge is more on adding depth and strength of will to the squad and man-management. McGinn, one of the most reliably effective players in the Championship last season, has already insisted that he remains committed to Hibs despite the failure to achieve promotion. The 21-year-old midfielder provides the kind of industry and spirit that a team can be built around. There may be critical decisions to make, though, since Cummings is entering the final year of his contract and so represents a sellable asset. He is a regular goalscorer, though, and Stubbs had to sign Anthony Stokes on loan last January to provide some support up front. These are tweaks compared to the amount of work Stubbs had to carry out when he was appointed two years ago. Hibs are ready to be guided forward, not waiting to be rescued.

In response, Number 10 said there were ""many difficult challenges"" in Libya, while the White House said it deeply valued the UK's contributions. Downing Street did not comment on President Obama's remark to the PM about defence spending, reportedly made before Chancellor George Osborne said the government would fulfil a Nato pledge to spend 2% of national income on defence last year. In response to the interview, a spokesman for the US National Security Council said Mr Cameron had been ""as close a partner as the president has had"" adding that ""we deeply value the UK's contributions on our shared national security and foreign policy objectives"". BBC North America editor Jon Sopel said the unsolicited statement put out by the White House suggested Downing Street had reacted angrily to the article. ""It's like we've seen a curtain drawn back on the unspun thoughts of President Obama, complete with frustration as well, and what we've seen tonight is the White House trying to close the curtain as quickly as it can,"" he added. The toppling of the Gaddafi regime in Libya - following UN-backed air strikes designed to protect civilians - led to a power vacuum and instability, with no authority in full control. The intervention was led by the UK and France - and in his interview, Mr Obama reflects on ""what went wrong"", saying: ""There's room for criticism, because I had more faith in the Europeans, given Libya's proximity, being invested in the follow-up."" Mr Cameron, he said, became ""distracted by a range of other things"". He also criticised former French President Nicolas Sarkozy, saying he had tried to claim the spotlight. The former French president, he said, ""wanted to trumpet the flights he was taking in the air campaign, despite the fact that we had wiped out all the air defences and essentially set up the entire infrastructure"" for the intervention. President Obama said the intervention ""averted large-scale civilian casualties (and) prevented what almost surely would have been a prolonged and bloody civil conflict"". But he added: ""And despite all that, Libya is a mess."" He also criticised what he called ""free riders"" in the interview, saying European and Gulf countries were calling for action against Gaddafi, adding: ""But what has been a habit over the last several decades in these circumstances is people pushing us to act but then showing an unwillingness to put any skin in the game.""

together_opt-175b,Ricky Burns has become only the third British-born fighter to win world titles at three weights.,"With three defeats in his previous six bouts, the Scottish boxer's career seemed to be on the wane. But his power, timing and focus returned in a supremely confident display at Glasgow's Hydro on Saturday night as he clinched the vacant WBA World Super-Lightweight title - and entered the record books as the first Scot to win world titles at three weights. Italy's Michele Di Rocco, at 34 a year older than Burns, hadn't lost a fight since September 2007. He arrived with a record of 40 wins and a draw from 42 bouts. He left a lesser figure. The referee deemed the man from Assisi to be in no state to continue in the eighth round, the result of a welter of blows to his head and body and made all the more unbearable by the hostile acoustic energy generated by 8,000 Scottish fans. Surely, for Burns, this was time to shout about his record, the ideal moment to counter all those who had written him off and questioned the wisdom of him leaving trainer Billy Nelson two years ago to work with Tony Sim in Essex? No. Instead, the champion spoke of his disbelief at the ease of his victory, his gratitude that he was safe, of his thanks to promoter Eddie Hearn, manager Alex Morrison and coach Sim for believing in him, and of his desire to celebrate with a fast-food burger and 20 chicken nuggets. ""When I got in the ring after the fight, I said, 'You've done it! You've done it!',"" reported a beaming Hearn at the post-fight media conference. ""And you know what Ricky said? 'Can you get a picture with me and Michael Buffer [the legendary American boxing ring announcer]?'"" When he has time to reflect during a well-earned holiday, Burns will take immense satisfaction at being only the third British-born fighter, after Bob Fitzsimmons and Duke McKenzie, to be a three-weight world champion. In Scottish terms, his achievements must mean that he is in the very top tier of boxing greats, comfortably mentioned in the same breath as former world champions Benny Lynch, Walter McGowan, Jackie Paterson, Ken Buchanan and Jim Watt, for example. Burns' record stands at 40 wins from 46 bouts. Remarkably, 11 of those have been world title fights. Buchanan's exploits in the United States add lustre to his legacy, but while Burns may never have fought someone like Roberto Duran, should Hearn manage to set up a bout against Cincinnati's Adrien Broner, the four-time world champion stripped of the WBA title because he could not make the weight, then Burns could achieve little more in the sport. ""There are some big fights out there for me,"" said Burns. ""I want to fight the top names. I will fight anybody. I do super-lightweight comfortably and lightweight is still an option. I would fight Terence Crawford again if it came down to it. ""That's nearly two years I have been with Tony and things have just started clicking.

Sexually explicit content is not outlawed in Russia, but the law bans ""the illegal production, dissemination and advertisement of pornographic materials and objects"".

together_opt-175b,Scottish sports bodies are facing a 20% cut in government funding over the next three years.,"sportscotland says it has yet to decide where the cuts will fall amid concerns that elite athletes could suffer. The cuts are being blamed on reduced government spending and a drop in National Lottery ticket sales - a major contributor to sports backing. Governing bodies are bracing themselves for potential job losses. About 60% of funding is made up from Scottish Government money, with lottery sales making up the rest. In the year ending 2015, total revenue was £65.1m, which is divided up and awarded to 52 sports.

The hosts, slacker after the break, had beleaguered striker Larnell Cole sent-off after he confronted the referee. Liam Craig sealed the win from the penalty spot with two minutes to play, before Graham Cummins finished a sumptuous stoppage-time move. And things got worse still for Caley Thistle after the match, with captain Gary Warren shown a red card in the tunnel. Saints remain five points clear of Hearts in fourth place, and closed the gap on third-placed Rangers, who play Aberdeen on Sunday, to three points. With game after game ticking past, Inverness' position looks increasingly perilous. Next weekend's trip to Motherwell, second-bottom on goal difference, is now seismic. This contest turned nightmarish for the hosts after a bright opening, but the truth is, given their predicament, Caley Thistle did not threaten St Johnstone's goal enough. Billy Mckay sent a shot over from close range. Alex Fisher nodded a diving header wide. Carl Tremarco miscued a volley. Greg Tansey did draw a save from Alan Mannus when he rasped in an effort from outside the box, but Richie Foran's side never looked likely to find the net. Their best opportunity came immediately after the Saints went ahead, when Tansey fed Cole, who seemed to panic in a terrific position and shot straight at Mannus. Cole's dismissal ended the contest when he appeared to be cautioned twice for challenging referee Stephen Finnie's decision not to award a foul. St Johnstone were merciless and could have had more. With just one win from their last 21 league games, Inverness look deep in trouble. Tommy Wright's side deserve so much credit. Saints were tactically brilliant, so strong defensively and ruthlessly capitalised on their man advantage. They took one of their few first-half chances when Michael Coulson broke down the left and sent a dangerous ball across the six-yard box. Owain Fon Williams could only parry into the danger area, Cummins' shot was blocked but Maclean followed up to force it home. They should have had another when Craig's superb curling corner flew all the way to the back post where Cummins slid in and somehow knocked it over from two yards. Craig, in his 300th appearance for the club, coolly converted a spot-kick after Cummins was tripped to seal the points. Cummins then slammed home after Miller danced around the area to tee him up, before Craig cracked the bar amid the late flurry. With a tendency to finish the season strongly, and just a three-point gap to Rangers, the Perth side look capable of something special this term. Inverness CT manager Richie Foran: ""It is a tough time of the season to be sitting bottom, and I need real men to stand up to that, but not enough of them did that today.

Following on, he then made 68 in Surrey's 166-3 to keep Hampshire at bay and prompt handshakes at 16:50 BST. The draw sees third-placed Hampshire claim 12 points, while Surrey take 10 points and stay sixth in Division One. Burns' epic effort saw him stay in the field for all but 10 overs of the entire match, as he defied Hampshire's bowling efforts on a flat Oval pitch. The left-hander was dropped twice in the slip cordon in his career-best 219, but was the only one to resist as Ian Holland (3-37) dismissed Tom Curran (53), Amar Virdi and Mark Footitt to force the follow-on after Surrey began the day on 410-7. Mark Stoneman (47) and Burns then put on an opening stand of 109 before Holland's medium pace had Stoneman lbw and Scott Borthwick bowled in a single over. Sean Ervine became the only man to dismiss Burns in 756 minutes of play when he missed a ball down the leg side, but Jason Roy and Dominic Sibley continued on until the conclusion. Surrey captain Rory Burns told BBC Radio London: ""I'm really pleased that we've fought that hard to get the draw and the extra five points, and obviously pretty happy with how I've played. ""We had to bat seven sessions to get us to safety and that's all I was thinking. ""There were some jitters in the nineties and I got a lifeline, which was quite nice. When I was getting close to 200, I was more thinking about the situation of getting to the follow-on mark. ""They're a good side and they played really well. We managed to hold on and get ourselves to safety, so it was honours even on a flat wicket.""",0,4,3

The council said it would bring staff in line with the other 17,000 workers and ""reduce the risk"" of staff making claims for equal pay. Union Unison said it was ""bitterly disappointed"" with the decision. Regional officer, Helen Metcalf, said: ""This is a devastating blow for the 2,700 teaching assistants in the county, who now face being driven into poverty and relying on food banks through losing Â£200 - Â£400 per month of their salary."" She said there was ""no option"" but to lodge a formal dispute and ballot members for industrial action. Teaching assistant Tony Lowery, said: ""It is really devastating for my family because I'm the main wager. I don't mean things like going on holidays or a second car, I mean things like food on the table and clothes on our backs."" Liberal Democrat councillors voted unanimously against the plans. Councillor Owen Temple said the affected staff would ""find themselves the poorest teaching assistants in the North East"" and the council was ""very likely to face legal challenge"". The council's corporate director of resources, Don McLure, said there was a ""real risk"" that, under the present contracts, other council employees could make claims for equal pay with the teaching assistants. He said: ""I fully understand the position teaching assistants are in but they are very valued, they do a great job and support the education of our children, but we are doing this to bring them in line with the rest of our workforce.""

together_opt-175b,The Scottish government is to introduce legislation to address problems with its Named Person scheme.,"John Swinney will address MSPs over a legal challenge to information sharing proposals within the Act. The system would appoint a named person - usually a teacher or health visitor - to ensure the wellbeing of every child. But judges at the UK's highest court ruled against the scheme in July 2016, citing concerns over information sharing. The Supreme Court judges said some proposals breached rights to privacy and a family life under the European Convention on Human Rights. However, the court said the aim of the Act, which is intended to promote and safeguard the rights and wellbeing of children and young people, was legitimate. Speaking ahead of his statement to the Scottish Parliament, Mr Swinney said the Scottish government remained ""absolutely committed"" to the Named Person service as a way to support children and their families. ""Last year the Supreme Court ruled definitively that the intention of providing a Named Person for every child to promote and safeguard their wellbeing was 'unquestionably legitimate and benign',"" he said. ""Their judgement did, however, require us to change the provisions relating to information sharing. ""Since the judgement, we have undertaken an intensive period of engagement with children, young people, parents, carers, practitioners and professionals. ""I will now update parliament on the next steps in this vital means of supporting, safeguarding and promoting the wellbeing of our children and young people."" The judges said in July that specific proposals about information-sharing were ""not within the legislative competence of the Scottish Parliament"". And they said the legislation made it ""perfectly possible"" that confidential information about a young person could be disclosed to a ""wide range of public authorities without either the child or young person or her parents being aware"". The appeal was brought by the No to Named Persons (NO2NP) coalition, which includes the Christian Institute, Care (Christian Action Research and Education), Tyme Trust and the Family Education Trust. The Scottish government has said previously it would not commence the legislation until the problems were fixed.",1,5,3

Political leaders, businesses, sporting organisations, and charities will meet at Lancaster House on Thursday. Mr Cameron says corruption is ""the root of so many of the world's problems"". He also described it as ""an enemy of progress"". ""It destroys jobs and holds back economic growth, traps the poorest in desperate poverty, and undermines our security by pushing people towards extremist groups,"" he added. ""The battle against corruption will not be won overnight. It will take time, courage and determination to deliver the reforms that are necessary. But we cannot hope to solve the major global challenges we face without tackling the exploitation, fraud and dishonesty at their heart. ""For too long there has been a taboo about tackling this issue head-on. The summit will change that. Together we will push the fight against corruption to the top of the international agenda where it belongs."" Among the world leaders attending the summit are presidents Ashraf Ghani of Afghanistan, Juan Manuel Santos of Colombia and Muhammadu Buhari of Nigeria, and Norwegian prime minister Erna Solberg. Russia is to be represented by deputy foreign minister Oleg Syromolotov. Panellists are expected to include World Bank president Jim Yong Kim and International Monetary Fund's managing director Christine Lagarde. Under the prime minister's plans, leaders at the summit would pledge to expose corruption and pursue and punish those who perpetrate, facilitate or are complicit in it. Campaigners have also called for a crackdown on tax havens linked to the United Kingdom. The recent Panama Papers leak showed how some wealthy people use offshore firms to evade tax and avoid sanctions. A Downing Street spokesman said: ""We are in discussions with the Overseas Territories and Crown dependencies with major financial centres about their attendance, and expect a number to join the summit."" Robert Barrington, of anti-corruption campaigners Transparency International, said: ""The prime minister is creating a platform for governments that are serious about fighting corruption to make really significant changes and set the agenda for a generation to come.

together_opt-175b,"The UK manufacturing sector has contracted for the first time in more than three years, according to a closely watched survey.","The Markit/CIPS manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index fell to 49.2 from 50.7 in March. A reading below 50 indicates falling output. It is the first time that activity in the sector has fallen since March 2013. Firms blamed soft domestic demand, a fall in new business from overseas and uncertainty ahead of the EU referendum. A slowdown in the oil and gas industry, a major customer for UK companies, is also hitting production. The index for new orders fell to 50.4 in April, from 51.9 the month before, matching February's three-year low. Rob Dobson, senior economist at Markit, said: ""On this evidence manufacturing production is now falling at a quarterly pace of around 1%, and will likely act as a drag on the economy again during the second quarter and putting greater pressure on the service sector to sustain GDP growth. ""The manufacturing labour market is also being impacted, with the data signalling close to 20,000 job losses over the past three months."" Last week, official figures showed UK economic growth slowed to 0.4% in the first quarter of the year from 0.6% in late 2015, propped up by the services sector. David Noble, group chief executive at the Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply (CIPS), said: ""Recent fears over a stall in the UK's manufacturing sector have now become a reality. ""An atmosphere of deep unease is building throughout the manufacturing supply chain, eating away at new orders, reducing British exports and putting more jobs at risk. ""A sense of apprehension across the sector is being caused by enduring volatility in the oil and gas industry, falling retailer confidence and the uncertainty created by the EU referendum."" The Markit/CIPS survey found new export orders contracted for the fourth straight month in April as the global economy continued to slow. A measure of employment in the manufacturing sector was also below the 50 mark for its fourth straight month. Lee Hopley, chief economist at the manufacturers' organisation, EEF, said: ""The sharp drop to a three-year low and another month of reported job cuts could be the clearest sign yet that referendum uncertainty is starting to weigh on the real economy. ""However, this is just another straw on the back of a sector already grappling with the struggling oil and gas sector, softening domestic demand and weak order outlook from other parts of the world, all of which are failing to provide any counterbalance to the political uncertainty at home.""",0,4,4
together_opt-175b,The US Supreme Court has ruled that tax subsidies that make health insurance affordable for low-income individuals can continue.,"In a 6-3 decision, the justices said that tax subsidies that make health insurance affordable for low-income individuals can continue. The ruling preserves the law known as Obamacare, which Mr Obama considers a major part of his presidential legacy. Republicans have vowed to continue fighting the law. ""We've got more work to do, but what we're not going to do is unravel what has now been woven into the fabric of America,"" Mr Obama said. The case, known as King v Burwell, was the second major challenge the law has faced in the US's highest court. Unlike in many other western countries, the US does not have a single-payer healthcare system. Private companies, rather than the US government, provide health insurance for US citizens. The enactment of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) - one of Mr Obama's most significant and controversial domestic achievements - in 2010 mandated that every American had to purchase private insurance. It provided the subsidies to allow many to do so. In 2012, the mandate portion of the law was challenged in the court. The justices ruled to preserve it. In that decision, as in the decision on Thursday, Chief Justice John Roberts surprised observers by siding with his liberal colleagues in support of the law. ""Congress passed the Affordable Care act to improve health insurance markets, not to destroy them,"" Chief Justice John Roberts wrote in the opinion. Justice Anthony Kennedy dissented in 2012, but sided with the majority on Thursday. Had the court made the opposite decision, an estimated 8.7 million people in the US would have been at risk of losing the aid that makes healthcare affordable. The stakes could not have been higher. People's health (crucially important) and Obama's legacy (less important, but for him and those around him fairly vital) were at stake. Well a politically finely balanced Supreme Court has given an emphatic, overwhelming vote in favour of the president by 6-3. I bet ""No-drama Obama"" is high-fiving anyone and everyone in the White House - that is how big it is. Obama defies lame-duck expectations Demonstrators gathered outside the court as early on Thursday morning. Reading updates on their mobile phones, the crowd became jubilant when they learned mid-morning that the court had ruled in their favour. Some began dancing, while others chanted ""If you're covered and you know it clap your hands."" ""This is a big sigh of relief for millions across the country,"" said Ron Pollack of Families USA, a health-care advocacy organisation. ""The ACA is not just the law of the land, it will remain the law of the land"". ""Today is a good day for healthcare in America,"" said activist Benton Strong. ""I hope this is the end of the line."" Demonstrators opposing the subsidies did not have a large visible presence. Justice Antonin Scalia wrote in his dissent that the Supreme Court is setting a precedent of favouring some laws over others. ""We should start calling this law Scotuscare"" Justice Scalia wrote, referring to the court's acronym. ""Today's interpretation is not merely unnatural; it is unheard",1,5,5
together_opt-175b,The Welsh Conservatives have been given a huge confidence boost after winning the Vale of Glamorgan constituency.,"The Conservatives have been given a huge confidence boost and will feel in a position to challenge in more constituencies next year, rather than just on the list. At the party's weekly press briefing, I asked the Welsh Conservative leader Andrew RT Davies, who was elected on the list, whether he'd stand as a constituency candidate in his home turf of the Vale of Glamorgan but he said he hadn't thought about it. Presumably those are the kind of decisions they will now feel more confident contemplating. The party will also have a huge amount of new data on voters which it'll be able to call upon and the belief that campaigning hard on the NHS helped the Tories cross the line in places like the Vale of Clwyd and Gower. The Conservatives feel it's them, rather than any of the other opposition parties, who have become the repository of votes from those who are disaffected by the state of the NHS. Welsh Labour are going to hold a ""short sharp"" analysis into what went wrong. Carwyn Jones was in line with most of the criticism of Ed Miliband when he told AMs that the party needed to appeal to small business owners who are not millionaires but who work hard. What will be more difficult is countering the argument on the NHS, which the former minister Alun Davies believes is already lost. Another potential difficulty for Welsh Labour will be dealing with unhappiness within the party over council re-organisation. Bernie Attridge, the deputy leader of Flintshire Council, has tweeted saying the party needs to be careful on local government reform if it wants to retain the support of grassroots councillors. It also seems to have been the case that Labour lost more votes to UKIP than the Conservatives, which is another challenge to overcome. But Labour will at least have the advantage that it will be David Cameron, and not Ed Miliband, carrying out the latest round of public sector cuts that are likely to take effect sooner rather than later. The question is whether Carwyn Jones is going to be able to turn that to his advantage when his own record in government will be under scrutiny. Plaid Cymru's education spokesman, Simon Thomas, also in the party's weekly press briefing, said he believed Leanne Wood could portray herself as an alternative first minister because of the way she emotionally connected with people in the campaign. The party now has a year to make that a credible proposition after it failed to gain any new seats and came fourth, behind UKIP, in the overall share of the vote, despite her unprecedented profile. He also said that on the campaign trail people wanted to know what Plaid was going to do about the NHS and that people ""did not see the strengths"" of its arguments. The Welsh Liberal Democrats are still licking their wounds but in a ""je ne regrette rien"" moment, the leader Kirsty Williams said she had no regrets over the coalition.

together_opt-175b,The Welsh government has scrapped plans to create a series of marine protected areas after a public consultation.,"Alun Davies told AMs they had received 7,000 responses to a consultation containing ""strongly held"" views. He said he would now look at the 125 existing marine protected areas to see if further improvements could be made. The Marine Conservation Society (MCS) described it as an ""embarrassing U-turn"" for the Welsh government, and has called for better protection of seas. Creating the zones would mean a ban on fishing and anchoring in some areas and had brought opposition. The Welsh Fishermen's Association said previously that existing conservation networks for Welsh waters are adequate. The Welsh government proposed the zones last year with the backing of the Countryside Council of Wales and the Marine Conservation Society. The minister for natural resources said the decision had been made after the thousands of responses to the consultation brought ""divergent and strongly held views"". Mr Davies said to ""avoid any continuing uncertainty over the options presented in the 2012 consultation, I am also withdrawing all the proposed sites"". His comments come after the findings were published of a task and finish team which reviewed the feedback. Now, he will concentrate on the existing 125 Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) that cover 36% of Welsh seas to see if any changes can be made rather than creating additional zones. ""We are now in a stronger position to assess our current contribution to the network's ecological coherence,"" he said. ""I have, therefore, commissioned an assessment of our current MPAs to identify if there are any gaps and what the options might be to fill those gaps. ""If any measures are required, I believe they should be simple, proportionate and fit for purpose."" Dr Peter Richardson, biodiversity programme manager for MCS, said the Welsh government ""spent an awful lot of time and money and encouraged other people to put effort into this consultation response"". He said: ""70% of the consultation responses were in favour of designating these sites and yet today the minister has announced he's scrapping the whole thing... bit of an embarrassing U-turn for the government I think."" He added: ""I think there are plenty of people in the fishing industry... that understand that in order to get the best yields from the marine habitats on which they depend, they have to be managed properly.""",1,5,5

Last November, anti-abortion protester Bernadette Smyth, who leads the Precious Life group, was convicted of harassing Ms Purvis at the Marie Stopes office in Belfast city centre.
